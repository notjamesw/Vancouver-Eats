It's located in the Industrial part of Maple Ridge, but very easy to get to. This place was previously Summer's Diner and IMO, the food is much better now. It is easily some of the best food in Maple Ridge. The only thing that needs work is the time to receive your food. We have been there a few times in the last month and the service is slow.

We ordered $150 worth of food, and every single item was spot on—delicious and perfectly prepared. I was particularly impressed by our server, Shagal, who must have a photographic memory. She effortlessly memorized each member's order and the necessary amendments, ensuring that everything came out exactly as we requested.\n\nA big thanks to Chef Harjap, who did an amazing job in the kitchen and truly made our day special. We enjoyed a delightful spread that included Kadai Paneer, Chana Bhatura, Pav Bhaji, two Veg Thalis, Veg Noodles, Paneer Malai Tikka, and dessert. The portion sizes were generous, far better than what you often find at other restaurants, where you might feel shortchanged.\n\nDuring the meal, we all sampled each other's food and were consistently amazed by the flavours.

I have been eating Caesar salad’s for the past 20 years and thought it’s about time I get serious about these leafy greens covered in cream sauce. I hope your as excited as I am.\n\nPaliotti’s in Maple Ridge- only one other Italian restaurant to choose from\n\nDressing: creamy base, with a nice lemon coating, heavy garlic (yum), fresh ground pepper and anchovies. Can’t believe I’m saying this but maybe too much sauce.  Definitely tastes homemade though.\nLettuce: romaine, cold and crisp, however cut too large\nCroutons: out of a package\nCheese: questionable? Powdered parm on top but within the dressing a thicker heavier tasting cheese I couldn’t figure out.\nBacon: none- which is honestly how I prefer my Caesar’s. Bacon seems to over power the sauce and texture (to me)\n\nI went to this restaurant after 8 years of my mom passing away with my girlfriend. My mom always ordered penne alla vodka. I was searching all over Maple Ridge and could not find it on the menu. This place seemed the most authentic and warm. We obviously has to order the Caesar salad, but I asked if they could do an alla vodka sauce but on my favourite… Gnocchi!\nSoooo tender, sauce missing pancetta but still very good and grateful I got to eat in my moms honour\n\nOverall, very authentic, great service and food came quick. There is a creepy table that you can’t site at with the Mona Lisa looking over you but that’s guna stop us from coming back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNuojeziO4jMgePhjk0PXm2X7mUMU0L7plipgTc\u0026fid=0x0:0xc63b0c31f63b1714""],""When"":""2024-7-26""},{""Name"":""Jacquelyn Johnston"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLfy_pLzvat08k9FzqYD-5djtqo3UfUv3fLgHw-FhXMEBTZ9A=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""My friend and I thought we'd try the Wednesday steak or ribs special for $18.95, misleadingly advertised on the outdoor sign as steak and ribs.

We did ask more than once and waitress never came back.  Other than taking our initial orders and delivering food we were completely ignored.  Table full of empties, what a mess.  No one ever came to clean our table.  Plates were picked up but never any glasses and never any water refills.   We had brought in a cake and those dishes were never picked up. Our time there took 3.5 hours.  It took over an hour to get our bills.  We had school aged children and 3 women in their eighties.  They waited, we all waited over an hour for the bill.  We could not understand why.  One waitress said their machine was 30 years old and it would take awhile.  I saw and watched other tables in restaurant get great prompt service.  Their bills came in a timely matter.  They did not wait over an hour for their bill.\nTheir tables were cleared upon finishing their meal. We were blatantly ignored. To top off such a rude experience, the waitress hand wrote a 20% forced gratuity on every bill.  We had no prompt service.  That wasn't offered.  Shady business.  Very clear we were ignored as there was a guaranteed 20% tip from us, no matter what little service we got.  They do not get the 20% guarantee from the smaller tables.

This seems to be an issue with the menu setup on your end, and I kindly request that this be reviewed to improve the ordering experience.\n\nAdditionally, sauces are an essential part of enjoying a pizza, and their absence significantly affects the meal’s quality. If sauces cannot be included with the order, customers may have to resort to buying them separately elsewhere, which detracts from the overall experience.

She passed us several times, each time without our drinks which could’ve easily been placed on her tray and dropped off. She’d run past our table, tap it and say she was grabbing whatever we had asked for or to take our order, but would take nearly 30 minutes each time to come back. We saw her maybe 3 times, and what should’ve been a quick in and out for some wings, we were there almost 3 hours, had only 1 drink refill and nothing else, never asked us if we needed anything, and you couldn’t catch her otherwise. Also, they cease to mention that pop refills are not free on Wednesdays, which seems like a scam to get you in the end. While it’s just pop, I understand, be upfront with customers so they can decide what they want to do with that information. It wasn’t until we asked for the bill (3 different times) that she finally came and had a second to stop and chat, to which she instantly brought up her children and Christmas coming, which to us felt like tip baiting. Terrible experience, which tanks because the atmosphere seemed like it could be fun, and the food (wings at least) wasn’t bad."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""John"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWw5rMQatibni75tbNpjJbP4ehPrGlbmCLKvcJ6Naf176pomyyjJw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I have never been to \""The Reach\"" before.

I called and made reservations for 530 for my family of 5\n\nFood takes a long time to arrive - we complained about how slow it was and the waitress said \""this is a 2 hour seating\"" and that's \""how the kitchen works\"". I could understand if it was fine dining but let's be clear, this is store bought pasta with home made sauces.\n\nMy three boys liked the marinara sauce and the pasta was cooked nicely.\n\nMy wife had the \""special\"" which was roasted chicken (two drum sticks and one thigh) for $29. No mention on the menu that it was only dark meat. She said it was ok and ate most of it but was also very hungry as we had been waiting nearly 1.5hrs for the food to come out.\n\nThe manager?owner?/chef? Went around to every table except ours to check in with customers. We heard him mention it was someone else's birthday and congratulated them - he made no mention to my son about it being his birthday even though it was specified in the reservation (whatever).\n\nThe worst part of the night was when I asked the manager?owner?/chef? About my carbonara sauce. The sauce was cooked improperly - carbonara is supposed to be silky smooth without any curdling of the eggs. My pasta basically had cream, oil and scrambled eggs on it. Apparently this is \""how we do it there\"".  When I explained that this is not what I was expecting and that it wasn't properly made he became very standoffish and rude.

The server came to our table shortly afterward and took our beverage orders, and discussed the evening specials. She left us with the menus and returned a short time later with our drinks.

The timing on our main courses was perfect, and we had a short break between the completion of our salad and our main courses. I decided on the Penne Amatricana, and my wife had linguini Bolognese and meatballs.  The meatballs were about the size of a tennis ball and they were delicious.  My penne dish was also delicious, and I ate the leftovers the following day for lunch.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great Italian meal.

The vegetable mix was just average, and the rice was good.

There was a lot of available seating and the place wasn't busy (2 other tables in use), which is why the service was kinda shockingly bad (there was a high staff to guest ratio). I think it might have been just bad luck, or maybe just the person responsible doesn't understand buffet service expectations. In my opinion, even at a buffet service is important. Plus it's an opportunity for the staff to earn tips to share with the kitchen etc. It would take much effort to really elevate the experience. Clearing the plates, bringing more water, asking if I wanted anything else to drink... I just didn't feel the care you want to feel eating out somewhere. Hope the owner / manager sees.

Time determines food prices – after 3 PM, bowls cost a buck more. Sharing? Nope. And if your bowl hits 700 grams, cue extra charges! It's like a hunger puzzle!\n\nBoth veg and non-veg bowls cost the same until 700 grams. In what world is that fair? Also, how do you know the weight without a scale? I played it safe, staying probably under 400 grams. Other spots weigh your meal, fair and square. Here? It’s a guessing game: lose out on food or pay extra, no middle ground.\n\nThe food setup's odd too. Sauce at the start? We pour sauce on food, not dunk food in! At 19 CAD (with tax) for a bowl, the price felt steep for what we got. Plus, two bland spring rolls tagged along, probably apologizing for existing. Soggy and off, a first in my Asian eats.\n\nKudos to the front desk girl, trying despite the chaos. But with food and setup off-kilter, staff magic can only do so much. Have other customers of this place been to legit Mongolian spots?

The ramen was okay, just noodles in spicy soup and was hoping for some kind of protein other than an egg drop.\n\nOverall it was well priced and decent sushi but nothing Wow'd us that we ate there so far."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNVmiuepjVssBeyklvgxavV22Dervs9cAIAvQQN\u0026fid=0x0:0xe4e948ab312ca912""],""When"":""2016-11-10""},{""Name"":""Alexa Blouin"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXDw57hgtPB0lGwZCH-Ubgklok7_HjV9d1e1xryqQmEJc-yxbk=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The value for the food is really good.

This needs something, like gravy or cranberry preserves, or a different binding agent to hold in more moisture (like a combination of egg and a fat, like butter).\n\nYour second tier are the scones. No complaints here--they were fine but I'd recommend upgrading the whipped cream to a Devonshire or clotted cream. You get two of the same scone but I think you could switch out one plain scone for a variation, such as a flavoured scone.\n\nThe top tier was the dessert tier and there was a significant difference in quality between some of the desserts. The strongest was the macaron--definitely professionally made and packed with flavour, and the technical execution of it was perfect. The weakest dessert was the gingerbread cookie--very lacking in flavour and very dry, and a missed opportunity to elevate the visual appeal by using frosting or nonpareils to decorate it. The cupcake was also a bit disappointing--I expected a Swiss or Italian buttercream as the icing was fairly heavy (like an American buttercream).\n\nThe tea itself was perfect--loose leaf tea brewed in a pot. Big plus here; the quality itself for the cream Earl Grey was very good.\n\nAMBIENCE\nThis cafe is located in a mall with lots of free (!!) parking, but there's heavy emphasis on visuals and making things look good. It's appealing to walk into but the benches inside aren't comfortable.\n\nSERVICE\nIt was okay--pretty average for North America.\n\nOne thing to note was that when I made the initial booking, I did reach out about dietary restrictions--and the owner responded directly, which was quite nice. They can make reasonable accommodations for special dietary needs, which is nice.\n\nSUMMARY\nAt $50.00/pp, my initial expectation was that this was competing against other team rooms at a similar price point such as The Secret Garden in Kerrisdale, or Tsujiri in Richmond. It's not going to match those at the current food quality level, but I think that it can be improved on. Alternatively, you can offer a more reasonable price for the tea service itself (and taking that this is located in Maple Ridge) would be in the $35-40 range but no more than that, especially if you don't have immediate plans to change the recipes of your present food items.\n\nHowever I do strongly recommend that food quality is improved upon as it seems that several shortcuts have been taken--dining out is expensive, and I think most people (especially Millennial customers who are starting to move eastward) expect the quality to be better than what they could potentially make at home. I think I would give this place another try if the food quality improves significantly to match the current price point."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPsHzc-QdzqiGyey1qDr2V-1M5vY1eFTjzLWwSj\u0026fid=0x0:0xa07ef7e7a06fb4fd""],""When"":""2024-12-21""},{""Name"":""Ashley Crawford"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJlusnkEzMHg99tCMVWcCqAWCXuoG9kym1NcYh5okU4omhY4g=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best bakery in town hands down!

never had Korean fried chicken before and I kept hearing that this was the place to go. Words can’t describe how impressed I was but I’ll give it a shot.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and spacious and very well organized. There was only one person working (I’m assuming the owner) and he was very friendly and attentive. He also brought us a couple of glasses of water even though we did not ask for any which was very nice.\n\nWe decided to try 2 half orders of boneless chicken. One of their signature seasoned chicken and the other was the garlic pepper chicken. At $16.50 for a half order I have to say that they were massive portions! The chicken was boneless thigh meat in an insanely crunchy breading and tossed in these delicious, sweet and spicy sticky sauces. We managed to eat half of both and packed up the rest.\n\nThe chicken was hot, juicy, and stayed crunchy even after sitting in the sauce for a bit. This place is seriously amazing and I would recommend this to anyone. Can’t wait to come back and try their different flavours! I read in some reviews that the cream and onion flavour is good so will most likely try that one!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO_-4XpVXwS4tuiPw6wDS5_y5bBOxBRywq3CB-z\u0026fid=0x0:0x5a3b1015c27fd198""],""When"":""2024-11-24""},{""Name"":""Jessameen Dela Peña"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX9mRpmL8-ZJUG7UPFcnsjzRdxjABif-MswbO1rxgJyyWfns8Jd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""If you're a fan of Korean fried chicken, this place is a must-visit!

Lynn is a gem and so are her staff that she has handpicked! The food was fantastic and everyone was impressed by the quality and selection. We are a pretty particular bunch when it comes to our meals and not one complaint was had. I would not hesitate to recommend Ban Chok Dee in Maple Ridge to anyone who is looking to book a venue for a special event. The only reason I gave 4 stars for the atmosphere was that it was actually quite hot in the restaurant and the AC wasn't operating in the dining area. Other than that we had no complaints! Lynn now has life long customers from my entire family all because of how she took care of us. Thank you Lynn!!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

We’ve been doing it just about every week for the last 18 to 24 months.  It’s our place - we even have our regular table.\n\nTonight was no different. We came in and sat. The server team brought us drinks without asking because they know what we order. They don’t usually even take food orders now because we order the same things each week.\n\nBut what WAS different tonight… is that when it came time to bring us the bill… they comped our entire table. They said “Merry Christmas” and comped us more than $80 in food to say thank you for our loyalty.\n\nThis was amazing. The profit margins are worse in restaurants than almost any other business. So for them to comp us all to say thank you, we recognize just how big a deal this was.\n\nThanks Woking dragon and staff. You folks are amazing.

The key to having a good meal here is knowing what to order as some items are a little bland tasting - as some reviews will tell you. The black pepper sauce is really tasty and you should try anything w that! Although we did not order any this time, their spicy salted prawns are also really good.

I've been hearing so many raves about this place I had to check it out. I did not enjoy it but I went back a couple months later to give it a second chance. I thought they might have been having an off day since everyone else seems to like it. The second time it was just as bad.\n\n(Feb 2019) My first visit I ordered chow mein, chop suey, almond chicken, sweet and sour pork for take out. The food had zero flavor. It's like they didn't use any sauce, salt, msg, soy sauce or anything at all. The noodles were cooked perfectly. But it was like they cooked them and then did absolutely nothing to them. No sauce, no spice, no flavor. Completely naked bland noodles. So the texture was great. Same with the chop suey. The veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly. They were nice and crispy. But it tasted like boiled broccoli, cauliflower, celery and mini corn. No sauce, no salt, nothing at all added. I've had worse. Some restaurants make their noodles and veggies all soggy and mushy so I appreciate the crispness. But is it common for restaurants to add nothing to these things? Or maybe they did and I just couldn't taste it at all. It just tasted like water. The almond chicken was flavorless. It literally tasted like flour and water. Again no salt or msg or whatever it is that Chinese restaurants usually add to give it that zing of flavor. The quality of meat in the sweet and sour pork was good. Cooked very well again but no flavor again. Is this an msg free restaurant, did they run out of salt, did they forget to add sauce? I've not a fan of salt, I never add it to my food and I often find Chinese food to be heavy on the salty flavor. But I found this food inedible without drowning it in soy sauce which I don't usually do with takeout.\n\n(May 2019) Decided the give this another try, maybe they were having a bad day. Ordered the same thing for takeout plus Char Siu and ginger beef. The veggies and noodles had a bit a flavor this time but nothing special. So that's an improvement there. But the almond chicken was so undercooked. It was soggy and completely white. I'm used to almond chicken being slightly browned (almond colour). I had to pull out my deep fryer to brown and crisp the chicken for my family. The ginger beef was pretty good. I've give it 7/10. The Char Siu sounded amazing on the menu \""slowly oven roasted to perfection\"" but tasted like a chewy, tough pork chop. We ordered enough for 4 people. Usually all the food is gone with Chinese but most of it was left over. No one in the family was really into it.\n\nSo overall good quality meat and veggies but poorly executed. You don't get very much for the price and it seems a little high priced. The staff was nice both times I went in for pick up. Very young though and inexperienced. Several of the girls looked about 15 years old. I think it's great that they are offering students in the community their first jobs. Would I recommend this place? I don't know. I know I'm never going there again because I was not impressed. But the rest of the Chinese restaurants in Maple ridge and Mission are awful with soggy mushy food and gnarly meat. So by default it makes this place \""the best Chinese in town\"". I guess I'd say give it a try and decide for yourself. I'll leave you with this, at least it's not horrible...."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNeFbAAvRIofLTWXtjgDu2doO0v-0Zf3nJALha1\u0026fid=0x0:0x55b3ae1f8ffb622f""],""When"":""2021-4-1""}]",

Decided to try this place for the first time. The menu online looks great but the experience was not what I expected.\n\nLet me just say that the service was great but that was the only thing that gives this review a 2nd star.\n\nThe Cajun chicken sandwich was a sloppy mess and the chicken breast was paper thin. It looks thick in the photo because they positioned the breast halfway outside the bun to expose the part of it that was curled up but it was maybe half an inch thick at most. The rest it was almost non existent.\n\nThe chicken tenders were literally nothing more than dry, rubbery frozen tenders. There are far better places to get high quality freshly prepared crispy chicken.\n\nOh, and after eating a sandwich and 2 tenders it left a gassy, heavy feeling in my stomach so now I’m laying on my bed on a Sunday afternoon with a bottle of peptol bismol next to me.\n\nWill not be returning. I know food costs are up but I have no desire to waste my money on establishments that raise prices while opting for cheaper ingredients.

Base on the sign, the chickens are locally source. The flavour is very home style. I got a mix of Original and Cajun. The original flavour has a salt and pepper taste. Not something from Churches. While the texture is firm, not overly cooked. Reminds me of free range chicken. The chicken pieces are smaller than Churches.\n\nI'm not a big fan of any French fries nor I eat alot of fish and chips. So I can comment to much on this restaurant. Won't be too fair. But, I would probably skip the fries next time. But the Halibut is not bad. Firm texture, not over cooked.\n\nSummary: Worth a try, but probably won't specially come here again for chicken from out of town unless I'm in town for a visit."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP0fz3IU--1aCQe5dTGakqTWHZunZzvKwPoZZzC\u0026fid=0x0:0x8193e4ced7d8c13e""],""When"":""2021-9-4""},{""Name"":""Noel G."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUzt56miafy6iOTVeM1GDzt7WeMhTEkWIDFideh9PNNM3c6ulXi=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""There was a bit of a wait, but this is understandable for  rather sought after food.

The cheese bread is appetizing and great, but I wish it was easier to share. The staff is very polite and really cares about the experience, waitress was friendly, this tops amongst the pizza places I've been to in Vancouver as within the top 10, it might even be top 3 but I would have to try their other pizzas. This is the small pizza and it comfortably feeds 2 people, when I return I'll probably get a larger pizza to take home and test the leftover capabilities. I'll edit this review when I do, for now if you want high end, this is definitely top tier in maple, Coquitlam, Poco and nearing cities given that there is few high quality pizza places. Jim's is unique in that it offers steak and salad as well, but that is a review for another day. Closing remarks is the appetizers for the price could be better shared, but the pizza is very competitively priced and the quality exceeds the price point, great value!

This was not a chicken breast. And to charge a customer $4.00 for that is a complete rip off. I specifically asked foe no pickles because i dislike pickles with a passion so i make sure that i let them know. As you can see in the receipt it says no pickles but my chicken sandwich had pickles. Plenty. The tator tots were cold. We were eating in the parking lot and they were cold yet we waited at least 15 min. To get out meal which is no problem if the quality of foof is good.

We visited there last week and we were not disappointed. The setting is quite unique in a charming tent-like setting adjacent to the farm. Despite its simplicity, it is an inviting and warm environment. We opted for the tasting menu with the matching wine pairing.\nAfter a refreshing Cucumber Amuse-bouche, we were presented with a delicious tomato salad, followed by a variety of wonderful wild mushrooms.\nOur first main course was a Salmon Filet, served with a delightfully crisp skin while still maintaining a moist and perfectly cooked centre\nThe Beef Tenderloin that followed was cooked to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth tender.\nAfter a Chocolate Amuse-bouche, we ended the meal with a choice of desserts.  It was impossible to pick a favourite out of the selection of Carrot Cake with Salted caramel gelato and carrot frosting, or the Sticky Toffee Pudding.\nOur service was very good, the wine paring made sense, and the whole experience was very enjoyable.\nA couple of improvements could be made by ensuring the hot items are served at a warmer temperature than they were. Also, servers should have an in-depth knowledge of the history and philosophy of the restaurant as one of the main reasons for the visit was to partake in a true Farm-to-Table experience.\nOverall, we found this to be a wonderful find in the Lower Mainland and without a doubt will return."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMh7aZzSFKPf_9_PkEFs0EiV3cTCwqAjEpCxOym\u0026fid=0x0:0xb1af0fd0c39a122b""],""When"":""2024-9-9""},{""Name"":""Stephanie Henderson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIvd6TE41ofXSIQsVETEKQwe90URxDLRLP3ccyJkWtaimnS=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This restaurant is truly a hidden gem.

The menu changes depending on what’s in season.\n\nWe went for our anniversary on Sunday, even though it was raining the outside tent was warm and comfortable.

But what really stood out to me was the saloon-style vibe and the farm surroundings, complete with scattered farm machinery and, the best part, horses!

Looking back, I regret not stopping in sooner, as the pizza here is undeniably delicious. While it falls on the pricier side, the exceptional quality of the food more than justifies the cost.\n\nI visited on a Wednesday as a walk-in, and the owner, who was alone, was managing a constant flow of walk-ins and pickups. Despite the hustle, he immediately acknowledged my arrival, inquired about my order, and, to my surprise, had already started preparing my pizza while simultaneously working on another customer's order. A true multitasker! It was evident that he's a big NY Yankee fan, judging by the sizable logo proudly displayed on the wall.\n\nBeing a vegetarian, I did notice that the menu options were somewhat limited. It would be fantastic if they could consider incorporating vegetarian alternatives like a Cheeseburger, Buffalo Chicken, or Pesto Chicken without the meat and chicken but substituting it. Additionally, introducing options with 'Beyond Meat' could cater to those seeking healthier choices.\n\nTo top it off, Albion Pizzeria even offered ice cream. When I inquired about the small and large scoops, the owner mentioned that their large scoop is an equivalent to three scoops, unlike the standard two you'd find in many other ice cream parlours. I know my kids would be thrilled about  that!\n\nLet's get back to the pizzas....Despite the somewhat restricted vegetarian choices (4 pizzas), the exceptional taste of the pizza makes me eager to return without a doubt!

But the rest of them are incredibly inept.\n\nOne guy who has been to my building MULTIPLE times still can’t operate the buzzer. Another can’t seem to figure out how to open the door when the thing buzzes. They barely speak, and have no customer service skills.\n\nToday the guy brings me pizza and his debit machine battery is so low that the machine won’t process the payment. So he leaves and days he’ll be right back to collect payment. He has to go get a new machine. Two hours later I had to call the store to find out what’s happening. I can’t wait all night for a guy who can’t figure out how to do the basics of delivering pizza to decide to come back to get the money.\n\nThe person who answers the phone hands it to the delivery guy who gets on the phone AND DOESN’T TALK. After about 30 seconds he says, “I’m the delivery guy”. I asked him when he was coming back because I can’t sit here and wait all night, and he said “oh, I’ll come right now.” HE WASN’T EVEN PLANNING ON COMING AT THAT TIME! He totally did not care how long I was waiting for him. Like a complete narcissist, he just figured he’d show up sometime before midnight when he felt like it?!!!! I mean seriously. I told him if he wasn’t here in 30 min he could forget about it because I won’t be home.\n\nSo now he says he’s on his way.\n\nI then talked to the manager. I told him what happened and he couldn’t even manage a simple conversation. He barely said a word and had no idea what to do or what to say. And that’s when I realized this Pizza Hut is staffed by the people who can’t hold a job anywhere else and that no one from management down cares about anything at all. They’re just insipid space fillers… if I owned this Pizza Hut I would close it down because clearly the owner also doesn’t care about his business.\n\nOne competent delivery guy. I order from here once a week and the only thing that’s more frustrating than their garbage service is the fact I have kept doing business with them for the past year+.\n\nNo more.

No dine-in customers in there during Sunday afternoon."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNJM9GNUwI0ru9tKcbV8xDYlbCz4S4aIqcbrnrv\u0026fid=0x0:0x10126d01160ec565""],""When"":""2024-6-10""},{""Name"":""Payam Alavizadeh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ_ZA_YHXhgNzKTpReaxZ12Y4AWYNOtDK5ZEhHo77Gk1YUw500=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I had a fantastic dining experience at Fatburger! Our order included the unlimited BBQ burger with mushroom and guacamole topping and the chicken spicy burger. To start, the unlimited BBQ burger was an absolute delight. Its flavors were incredibly delicious, and the combination of mushrooms and guacamole took it to the next level. The taste was simply outstanding.\n\nBut the goodness didn't stop there. The chicken spicy burger, which came with Curly fries, was also a winner. The spiciness added a kick of flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed. The fries were crispy and perfectly seasoned, making it a delightful pairing with the burger.\n\nWhat truly impressed me was the cleanliness and comfort of the dining area. It's always a pleasure to enjoy a meal in a clean and cozy environment, and Fatburger nailed it.\n\nSo, my visit to Fatburger was a culinary delight. The deliciousness of their burgers, the quality of their sides, and the inviting atmosphere make it a must-visit spot.

We then sat at a small dirty table, that was sprayed while we sat there and not wiped down fully. We were then asked if we are vegan or not, we said vegetarian, and the employee flatly asked us again if we are vegan or not. We said no, vegetarian. We were given meat menus, then waited a while and heard this employee lightly argue and correct a customer on the phone, then did the same to the couple that walked in after us. Thankfully those customers corrected her arrogance to ensure they get the right food with their dietary restrictions. We then asked for the vegan menu and got a snappy “oh you want vegan now?” Then received a very dirty vegan menu.\n\nI work customer service, so normally I don’t really mind if someone is having an off day.

That said, for such a simple breakfast, you could probably save more by just making it at home, especially if you’re not after the “dining-out” atmosphere.\n\nAs for Town Hall, their quality isn’t what it used to be.

When i pointed it out to her, she completely ignored it and asked very rudely what else i wanted, at which point i thought i might be wrong. That is until i get in my car and taste it to make sure. It is ham.

Fort Langley\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nWe had an early dinner at Beatniks Bistro with my parents, and it was a delightful experience. The ambiance was cozy yet modern, making it the perfect spot to relax and enjoy a meal in the heart of Fort Langley. We were seated promptly, and the staff were attentive and friendly throughout our visit.\n\nThe menu had a great selection of dishes, and there was something for everyone. We started with the crispy calamari, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. For mains, we had a mix of dishes, including the short rib and the salmon, both of which were cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. The flavors were balanced, and the portion sizes were just right. My parents really enjoyed the experience as well, and it was a lovely way to spend time together.\n\nWhat stood out was the quality of the food and the relaxed atmosphere. The outdoor seating area looked inviting too, but we opted to sit indoors given the cooler weather. Overall, Beatniks provided a wonderful dining experience, and we look forward to returning.

The second waitress who took over was regrettably rude and unprofessional. Despite her assurance to refill our water twice, she never returned with it. Although we ordered promptly, we waited 35 minutes without any food. When we finally flagged down the waitress, she explained that there had been a mix-up as she assumed we had finished our meal. When our food finally arrived, it was a mixed experience. My wife's gnocchi was good, but my fish and chips were disappointing; the fish was undercooked and frozen, making it impossible to cut.

We tried (I forgot the name, but I'll call it broccoli fries), and aside from that, I loved everything, especially the meat, which was incredibly delicious, and the portions were very large.\n\nThe prices are a bit high, but considering the portion sizes and the quality of the restaurant, it’s totally worth it.\n\nYou might have trouble finding parking, but other than that, everything was great.

With double height ceilings and a brick feature wall, the atmosphere is open, modern and full of light.  The staff were pleasant and quick to provide service.

The shakshuka was excellent, served piping hot in a cast iron skillet and full of flavour. The Croque Madame was also delicious. (We enjoyed dipping the fries in the leftover shakshuka if you have a willing partner!) Each dish is around $20-25 and was very much worth it for the serving size and the flavour.

I order the Lobster Mac \u0026 Cheese, which was their chef's special and their Blue Hawaiian cocktail. The Blue Hawaiian was very good and can taste the Malibu Rum and Blue Curacao in it. The mac and cheese exceeded my taste buds in how good it was. The entree has a nice gooey consistence from the cheese was baked, while the alfredo sauce was so flavoursome, and they make the sauce from scratch too. Despite the name, you are given one lobster tail for the mac and cheese, however the lobster was still great, especially when it is paired with the macaroni and cheese. It came with garlic toast too that I enjoyed. When I came there again, I ordered from their Brunch menu. I ordered their Forks Breakfast Bowl with coffee. Then entree tasted great overall; the rice tasted excellent, especially when paired with the hollandaise and salsa sauces. The coffee was good, not the best though. The interior design of the restaurant looks very high-class and clean as well. Because this is a large restaurant, there are different sections for you to dine at and the waiter would ask where you like to sit at. But I still recommend anyone to come and eat there during anytime of the day."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPJGhsUhQgTW7DbxupBbeswsoWrPddWCQliqPGr\u0026fid=0x0:0x71380e83264b3d4d""],""When"":""2024-8-11""},{""Name"":""Rayanne Boehm"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW7nXtx0vS86bw2PHY_udvCXyxr6MAucicGyxiWuXoTRwurJXG0=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The husband and I enjoyed our time here.

There was a buttermilk chicken option that would have tasted better with the sauce and toppings. All in all it was good. The kids menu was 14.95 and doesn't include a drink or dessert/ice cream. The burger was a good size but after a drink its $18. Most kids menus have that included and I think it would be a smart move. Their burger buns were ok but I'd love to drop a pack of my homemade buns off for them to give a try 🤣. This place has a lot of potential.

The park is also home to a diverse range of plant and animal life, making it a perfect place to connect with nature."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM7QR63o4deDIO1g5QLjtqYeJVEVL_itU2IkK8y\u0026fid=0x0:0x53c9dd48c2d2eae8""],""When"":""2024-7-12""},{""Name"":""Nihit Malhotra"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXfeHWYeDGkDTZNd33AgDsCmLoJ4NSwzG1vpopgAV9OU-hgspcS7Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Peaceful Park with Scenic Trails\n\nKanaka Creek Regional Park is a lovely spot with some good trails, perfect for a peaceful day outdoors. Parking is a bit limited, so plan accordingly. It's a great place for picnics, with plenty of spots to sit beside the flowing creek and take in the serene surroundings. The trail to the falls is only about a kilometer, but honestly, the falls themselves aren't particularly impressive—if you're coming just for the falls, it might not be worth the trip.\n\nThat said, the trail along the creek is definitely worth the walk. It has some steep inclines, so it's not stroller-friendly, but the scenery more than makes up for it. You can easily spend a few hours here, enjoying the quiet, sitting by the water, or even dipping your feet in the creek. A nice spot to relax and unwind."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNCycvGpZZ9IfzCB6ge1YwWL1si4Cmrja-Q4Gov\u0026fid=0x0:0x53c9dd48c2d2eae8""],""When"":""2024-9-4""},{""Name"":""Helena"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLiYVJyd2ntFwLRumbYS9Kznuj6jXHoPn0UkQ_zdJDM29rWiQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""A well-maintained Park for adventure.

I told her that was hardly fair either.  She asked to call me back in 5 minutes which she did and said that she could give 50% off the next order.

Please read with that in mind.\n\nPreface: I tried to submit this complaint privately through their website 'contact us' page, however their feedback form only throws errors.\n\nThe manager or owner put up a sign stating that they wouldn't be accepting expired coupons anymore. That's fine, and totally fair. What isn't fine OR fair is that the sign subsequently blamed that change on a minimum wage increase, and suggested that the store wasn't profitable with the new wages. That's the work of a really, really bad leader. Simultaneously throwing employees under the bus to customers (\""don't be mad at me, the one who should be accountable for this decision, be mad at my minimum wage employees!\"") while also announcing your resentment over being forced to pay minimum wage to your staff? That's really upsetting. Can you imagine being an employee and knowing your boss doesn't even think you're worth minimum wage? How awful for employee morale and retention. I can tell you for certain that, if I worked there and saw that, my motivation to work hard would disappear.\n\nShame on the manager/owner who posted that sign. Seriously. The minimum wage workers are the only reason you HAVE a business. You owe ANY success you have to them, not the other way around.\n\nAs for the staff we interacted with, they were all lovely people who were absolutely doing their best while crazy busy and understaffed. I have only positive things to say about the staff. They were far better than the manager of this location deserves."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPE7Rz5onbSbt9Q8K2tSwwLssMmrjwnGLdxmNEE\u0026fid=0x0:0x2b90d77af75bd8e0""],""When"":""2024-6-22""},{""Name"":""Chris L"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIlo27yi0c3tMg1MEFW8gltVROJwlBrQGtk927fnMS7KkAAA0UJ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The famjam came here for a cool treat, which was perfect with the warm weather.

Normally would give them a higher mark on staff...\n\nDoc Livingston, local realtor and I had a meeting and arrived right at 12:00 and stayed till about 1:30. Right in the middle of the lunch rush. It gets quite busy in there and it was fairly noisy. If I knew it was going to be that busy I would have delayed lunch till 1:00... by 1:30 The place was almost empty. Yes a huge lunch rush kudos to the restaurant for their consistent good food and fair prices.\n\nBoth of us had the bento boxes.   My order was spicy salmon. I eliminated the tempura bringing the price down on the bento box by a small amount and had them bring me appetizer or side a sizable Gomei.  Doc had the Sashimi bento box and asked for extra ginger which they supplied quickly.\n\nWe had tea, although alcoholic beverages are probably available I didn't check. I would ask them next time to bring a teapot to the table if they have them. They seems they brew them and bring a carafe around and top up people's tea. Great when they are adequately staffed.  This lunch time when we were there midweek they were short-staffed. My food was delayed, but it went arrived it was to the standard I was used to. Note to the manager they adjusted the order and bought us an extra dish that we had not asked for as a sampler and a gratitude for the wait.\n\nThis restaurant does a huge takeout business... So if you're looking for takeout sushi in the Maple Ridge area, consider this place as they have three tables to place the takeout orders on near the front door.\n\nThe atmosphere there is definitely in need of a update. It is not a fancy Japanese style restaurant. There are others in Maple Ridge that have significantly better atmosphere. I go here because the food is usually a five-star every time. If you're looking for a nice decor, fancy restaurant you'll need to choose another one. If you're looking for good food at a fair price, and usually excellent service, this would be a place to go!

It was supposed to have shrimp on it, there wasn’t any shrimp on it and it was terribly salty. The Alfredo was also horribly salty.\nThe one positive I will add is that the woman who served me was very friendly and pleasant."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP_SYugk5LvqdIoqEhJWlQx-EnqQy7LmZZaFboA\u0026fid=0x0:0xc8d4236b2754cc49""],""When"":""2024-7-25""},{""Name"":""Sandi Maki"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocItcaOKChuKmNvsvgz0cE7d6pyM9VQI0z2jx3OQNSSC9ZQP-Q=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We have been ordering from Andiamos for a long time and it was always good.

It's assumed that the top floor is residential, which adds to the unique charm of the place.\n\nThe presentation of the dishes at Akasaka is nothing short of impressive. Each plate is a work of art, meticulously arranged to please both the eyes and the palate. The vibrant colors and thoughtful garnishes enhance the overall dining experience, making each dish as visually appealing as it is delicious.\n\nThe quality of the food at Akasaka matches the high standards set by the restaurant’s ambiance and presentation. The flavors are authentic and fresh, providing a true taste of Japan. However, it’s worth noting that the pricing here is relatively high compared to its contemporaries. Despite this, they do offer a decent lunch special, which provides good value and allows diners to enjoy their exquisite cuisine at a more affordable price.\n\nFor those in Pitt Meadows looking for a restaurant that offers great food in a beautiful and cozy setting, Akasaka is the perfect choice.

She has been talking about it since so we decided to order there tonight as there aren't many local options that will accommodate her.\n\nI spoke to the PAC person and she told me the ginger garlic sauce was gluten free and showed the email from the manager confirming this. I went on the website to order but this sauce doesn't exist in the build your own bowl so I called. During the call, I told the person who answered about our school and gluten free and she confirmed the ginger garlic sauce was the one. I said I would call back with the rest of our order.\n\nLess then 5 minutes later I called back and I said \""okay I will get one of those ginger garlic with chicken and rice\"" then I ordered the rest of our meals. She said ok, it would be ready in 25-30 min. I told her my name and said my husband would be picking up and gave her name. This was not a rushed conversation. She had lots of time to clarify anything.\n\nSo my husband went in time to pick it up. He forgot his phone at home. I noticed it was taking super long to come back. When he finally arrived he told me that when he went to pick it up, the lady told him that she knows I wanted gluten free but nothing I ordered was gluten free. He said that was weird but paid anyway and left. He then had to go to a different restaurant to pick up something else for my daughter, spending more money and taking more time.\n\nWhen he got home and told me, I called back and was told I ordered a different dish. I said if that was the case, and you knew I was ordering gluten free since I just spoke to her and I told them it was me asking about the gluten free, why did she not confirm with me at the moment of ordering instead of waiting for when my husband went to pick up? Even if he had confirmed that was wrong, he would have had to wait for them to remake the dish. It would have made much more sense for everyone if she just confirmed when I ordered instead of not saying anything, especially since I kept saying gluten free. I am not the expert of their menu, they are.\n\nShe kept essentially blaming my husband and kept condescendingly saying \""I understand\"" (sounded like this was their training, because it was clear she did not understand). She offered no solutions so I ended the call. She called back and I chose not to answer. In the voicemail, she said she would make it no extra charge and we can go pick it up. But this isn't really a solution since 1. We already paid for the one they made that wasn't gluten free 2. I already spent extra having to get an alternate meal for her 3. It would have taken even more of my time to wait for it to be made and then drive back. Personally, I think they should have offered a refund or a coupon for the cost of the meal at the very be least.\n\nAs for the meal we got, those of us could eat it felt it was all just okay. Good value for money. It's a big serving. Had the customer service been good we would have tried again as it is good value for money.\n\nBad customer service combined with just okay food means we won't be repeat customers."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Erik Ostensen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKQpXi3wqlUgDP12KMcq1OauP6eTj3rkSzpWb3LA9l6F_pUCw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I work in the area and go here for lunch very often.

Hardly not enough time for it to go from blizzard thickness to liquid that was running off spoon. I asked her to remake it, she was not very happy about that. The 2nd one she gave me was better, not thick, but better...at least it didn't fall out of cup when she hung it upside down 2nd time LOL\n\nI got the new flavor Oreo chocolate brownie \u0026 it did not taste like chocolate at all, there was no brownies in it at all.

I held back on writing this review for a while because i don’t like writing bad reviews, but in this case because there are so many 5* reviews (which I myself mistakenly trusted before coming here), I feel it my duty to share my experience.\n\nI walked in an hour before closing. The space/atmosphere was initially nice and cozy. However within minutes of being seated, there were several employes buzzing and rushing hurriedly around creating an uncomfortable rushed feeling that they all wanted to get out of there.\n\nThe waitress greeted me promptly, was very friendly and polite throughout service. Sadly, the great service cannot compensate for the horrible food. Everything i ate tasted unfresh and bad, even the water tasted off.\n\nI ordered the beef teriyaki dinner box. First arrived water which had a strange unpleasant taste - how water can taste bad…i don’t know. Then came a complimentary “thing” (see photo) which was a nice touch and pleasant surprise. I call it a “thing” because I was not told what it was when it was brought to the table. Its taste was ok at first until I tasted dirty burnt frying pan. If you look at the photo you can actually see the burnt gunk on its edges. I’m not one to be ungrateful and complain about free things, but this was bad. The miso soup was the worst miso soup I’ve ever had (and I’ve had a lot in my life). It was lukewarm, watery, tasteless and had only 2 tiny pieces of green onion and no tofu whatsoever. The ebi sunomo arrived next. This tasted ok but the shrimp did not taste fresh and kind of grossed me out. The beef teriyaki was the worst. It came in a foul liquid instead of a sauce and believe it or not, tasted more like Chinese food than teriyaki. The gyoza, spring roll and tempura tasted good but old/unfresh. The salad was ok/standard. The dynamite roll was thick and packed but tasted fishy. I usually have a hard time taking food photos which convey the deliciousness of the food, but alas in this case the photos depict food which in reality tastes vile and unfresh. The friendly lady asks me “how was everything?” and of course I can’t say that everything tasted horrible, so i say “good, thank you”, what else can i say? I can’t very well complain about everything. I couldn’t finish my food and took the rest to go. I normally give leftovers to my dog but this time I wouldn’t because I didn’t want to risk him getting sick.\n\nI really am sorry to have to write a bad review for a local business. If this was a matter of slight taste preference, portion size, slow service or mistakes, I never would have written this review. However, when they serve me food that is this unfresh and old (who know how many hours or days old), they knew exactly what they were doing and such a thing cannot be rectified or explained away. Unless you have so little respect for your customers that you think they can’t tell the difference between old stale food and fresh food. I would not eat this food again if they were giving it away for free. And I’m the least picky eater ever, I’ll eat just about anything and be content. The service was friendly though…what a shame…"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP5r1mKxcRKBTg3bUDBvKDadIIChvLw_8dqYB8j\u0026fid=0x0:0x380b4b119dbe1d59""],""When"":""2024-8-15""},{""Name"":""Mandy Ouellett"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJKq9lp3Y1LfcLTPRaesiXyjPP6C2jhRCHNKPvuDgywEv1cAQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is my second time eating here and honestly it’s very good.

is the farthest from authentic I have ever seen for Thai food. People claiming this is authentic has not eaten from street carts in Thailand...\n\nThe pad thai is made from ketchup instead of tamarind... which is literally the essence of pad thai. Gone is the flavour of tangy sour noodles to disgustingly sweet bright red ketchup noodles. Plenty of chicken in there, barely any tofu. Not even a lime wedge. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\nThe Tom Yum Rice, which I have never seen, had a decent spicy flavour however the short grain rice they use was mostly overcooked and mush.\n\nI'm not 100% certain if the thai iced tea was done north american style with sugar and half and half, but it didn't taste anything what I am used to from thai teas. However it wasn't half bad.\n\nPerhaps it is more catered to western tongues, but it certainly is the farthest from real thai food I have ever seen. The portions are pretty small compared to other thai places, but there was plenty of the protein.\n\nThe interior is also incredibly dirty with dead flies on the windowsills."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQtvOVxfZ1NR5bT2ZkOiaAklW-4CliweRtwYLQ\u0026fid=0x0:0x138cc6888409a8ac""],""When"":""2024-10-12""},{""Name"":""Karen Learmonth"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWAYLqvwPqKN1kTBLaAVkwsaxCfbuBqQ76DtTJc9JuAX7yorH1j=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great little restaurant that is great for tasty healthy meals and knowledgeable about gluten free foods.\nFood spectacular!

No matter what time of day or day of the week, and no matter what I order, I’m always completely satisfied. The food is consistently delicious and fresh, the service is always exceptional, and the prices are very reasonable. My favourites are the Dynamite roll and the gyozas, (especially the veggie gyoza, it’s sooooo delicious). I highly recommend Sushi House!\n**********\nOriginal Review:\nI recently visited Sushi House and was very impressed by the exceptional customer service, the delicious food at an unbeatable price, and the clean and inviting atmosphere.  I highly recommend this place!\n\nWhen I entered, I was immediately greeted by the warmest, sweetest lady and by a friendly chef. I sat down and was brought a menu immediately. I asked for a glass of water which arrived instantly. I ordered the dyna-cali lunch combo special (dynamite roll, California roll and miso soup). You can’t find a better price for this combo anywhere. I hope they will keep this special.\n\nAs I waited for my food (which was not very long), I admired the space. It is the perfect welcoming atmosphere; very tidy, everything is precisely in its place, the decor is minimal and warm. But the level of cleanliness makes this place stand apart. I don’t think I have ever seen a restaurant this clean, it was spotless. There was not so much as a crumb on the floor, a streak on the table or a smudge on a glass, the place was immaculately clean.\n\nThe food arrived fast (but not rushed clumsily). The presentation was beautiful and clean just like the restaurant. The food was delicious and clearly made with love and attention to detail. The miso soup was flavourful and warm, the California roll and dynamite rolls were both fantastic and perfectly rolled. I especially enjoyed the dynamite roll; it was phenomenal.  The lady was attentive and checked on me the perfect amount and exactly as much as I needed/wanted her to without being overbearing.\n\nAs I ate, I overheard some “difficult customers” (you know, the type who want to power trip on others to compensate for the lack of control they have over their own meaningless existence). Customers making numerous ridiculous requests like “no green onions is the miso soup, no vegetables in the sushi and so on, and on…). The lady (owner/employee) dealt with them and their ridiculous demands so politely, without argument, and with so much grace and kindness (which they did not deserve). Indeed, the customer service here is ABOVE OUTSTANDING.\n\nFor once eating out, my bill did not give me a heart attack. Both the lady and chef thanked me and said goodbye before I left. Overall, a wonderful experience and I will definitely return! I only wish they were open Tuesdays so I could come here and go to a Hollywood 3 movie next door on cheap movie Tuesdays."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQT1nrRpwZnJ7DkhsXZ-uWj0eA-yoi6FqySLlI\u0026fid=0x0:0xf92f08e701b7895b""],""When"":""2024-5-13""},{""Name"":""korn vorakijkamjorn"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXKidx-Bl_RSOibV1JgF_iKUpQdRfa440hevV_KxRqmN0ZHh0Gh=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I do not normally leave reviews, but I must say, the atmosphere was so welcoming, and the owners were super nice!
