limit of an hour and a half abut didn’t take our order until just over 30 minutes after arrival and we didn’t receive or food until an hour after placing our order. If they had tried to enforce the time limit I would have made a big deal at that point. During our time there no one came to see if we wanted more drinks, my Nonna’s coffee never got refilled after making her wait 25 minutes for it in the first place and overall the service was actually pretty bad. I’ve been serving for almost 20 years so I get it, sometimes you’re slammed but there’s steps to take in between taking and order and delivering an order that need to be taken to ensure guest satisfaction. You need to tell people that food will be a longer wait. You tell them that their meal is coming, it will take a little longer than expected but is there anything else you can get them in the meantime while they wait. It’s just common courtesy as a server to practice that behaviour. On top of that, if guests are going to be waiting a longer time for food, the food that they’re served should be hot upon arrival. Making guests wait a hour for food without any notice isn’t great, but it’s absolutely unacceptable for them to receive cold food after an hour long wait.\nThe food was pretty terrible too. Undercooked vegetables, dry and overcooked meat, dry potatoes, flavourless and soggy Spätzle all served to us lukewarm or cold. The only tasty thing on the Menu was the blaukraut but the rest was not palatable. It kinda just added insult to injury for all of us that we had to wait for such lacklustre food.\nMy sister planned this birthday dinner for my nonna and I could see how sad she was when food took so long and especially after everyone started to complain because the food was terrible. I don’t think any of us will be returning to this restaurant when there’s the Old Bavaria Haus or even the Italian Restaurant Piva we could have gone to. All of us came over an hour out of our ways to go here and it was not worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMQAmeFJCrVxK33I2SpnHQmeyMO3_WzTwuhDLKn\u0026fid=0x0:0x7900e35e4cfe6178""],""When"":""2024-12-15""},{""Name"":""Naveen Sivasankar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVD85c8-gPz6lah-8hC6Wc52PIW1l9gF6x2wQmy27iEI7TaAflN=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""This was a good introduction to German cuisine, but there are some things that could make the experience better.\n\nThe atmosphere was great!

We got the camembert, potato pancakes and spatzle to share, and I got a Worsteiner beer, a regular schnitzel, and a chocolate mousse for myself.

We had the brussel sprouts and fritters to start - brussel sprouts were super crispy and flavourful, while the fritter is also pretty good but nothing too special. For main we ordered the Chef's Best pizza, Duck \u0026 Fig pizza, Duck, Halibut, and the Sable Fish to split among the table. Highly recommend the Chef's Best pizza and the Halibut - they were definitely our favourites. Duck was also really enjoyable - the cherry reduction went super well with the meat, but it is a bit pricey as the dish only came with 2 pieces of duck. We were quite disappointed at the Duck \u0026 Fig pizza as everything was too dry, feels like there is not enough sauce/fig jam. The Halibut itself was cooked to perfection with amazing texture, but the sauce is waaay too salty. For dessert we ordered the lemon tart and the affogato. The lemon tart was great - perfect balance of sweetness and tartness, and the berry jam on the side went really well with the tart. The affogato was just average.\nOverall we had a great experience here, and we are quite interested to try their brunch menu as well."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPvR0ogf3PJ6ES4lIO6J1FXeYlBD4j5CK0wpcpV\u0026fid=0x0:0xefee1f34aa4d5625""],""When"":""2024-9-20""},{""Name"":""Kristy Chen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWEfZ2rjxNiODjhooQ3vu4wU52UFmMssx1nBEw-QrGtiP3D8nPb=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Yummy Italian food, it is on the pricier side.

It’s a stone’s throw away from New Westminster Station - giving plenty of options to have someone else drive you home after (Skytrain, bus, taxi).  I did make reservations a week in advance and that process was quite smooth.\n\nOur server, Stefan was awesome!  He welcomed us quickly when we stepped in and checked in on us often.  We were 1 of 2 tables occupied on a Thursday evening before a long weekend - service was really great and only slipped a little once the small room filled up with a number of larger groups.\n\nOur table was small so with the combo of drinks and snacks we dropped cutlery a couple of times but Stefan was quick to zip in and provide a replacement right away without asking.  He was also creating drinks at the bar constantly while providing really great customer service.\n\nMy friend who “likes to drink in dark places” loved this place, the drinks were strong and the snack food is decent.\n\nThe Boulevardier Cocktail - the best one I’ve found since discovering it on a cruise ship several years ago and decently priced.  This sweeter cousin of the Old Fashioned was strong and I like the additional effort with their prep of the maraschino cherry.\nCucumber Collins (non-alcoholic) - a “rest” drink in between drinks, it offered that fizzy light relief I was looking for.  It’s nice that a prohibition style bar still had a handful of non-alcoholic beverages.  The price was a little on the higher side, but OK.\nLong Island Teapot - we split it for 4 and it was perfect.  It was strong and the teapot/tea cups were a nice touch.  We ended up staying so long we got this at their Happy Hour price which made it worth it - regular price I’m not so sure other than the fancier presentation.\n\nFood: overall the prices were decent for what we did try - we did mostly snacks and I’ll be back to try more.\n\nCrab stuffed mushroom caps - solid offering - even a crazier price at happy hour - would highly recommend\nNacho basket - they tasted good - size was like a half nacho order.  If you like nachos but don’t want to commit to a large basket this is it.\nToasted Walnuts - so great - even better than the ones you get on a plane - really enjoyable when fresh \u0026 warm - price was on a little bit of a higher side but no stale walnuts here… worth it in my opinion\nArancini balls - could’ve been better - not sure what happened but based on what I experienced not sure it was worth the $3.33/ball - more worth it at Happy Hour at close to half price.\n\nI’m really happy with this place and have already started recommending it to my foodie/drinking buddies.  It’s pretty unique and it’s close to transit which is a big selling point.  Drinks are strong and well-priced, food is decently priced for the area.  Small tweaks are needed but overall solid for a fun night out with your friends.\n\nAlso the customer service was awesome - thanks Stefan and the Flapper Lounge team!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPQn1PCxcM0GbvYo0E3gnIbUqvLj22OxYEACMzx\u0026fid=0x0:0x641e1455134a9e30""],""When"":""2024-3-30""},{""Name"":""Brigitte Danis"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ60G9H1oSjnh6iz4UwUMjxsTkrvs-7aTGl6fkY55gbzK3cPA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My friends reserved a table for happy hour at the Flapper Lounge, a speakeasy we were visiting for the first time.

Everything I have gotten has been absolutely tasty and fun. I always check their Facebook page to see if they have any seasonal or holiday special drinks. I got one during the Halloween season and it was soooo yummy.\n\nThe waiter, whom I think is also the owner is so kind and helpful and just a great guy overall. I can tell he really takes pride in his establishment . We told him we think it would be so awesome if one day they are able to expand and maybe bring in live music. It is a small place but the ambiance is very cool and reminiscent of the roaring 20s and days of prohibition. The last time we went we could tell they had also updated their decor which made for a much more elegant feel.\n\nI will say we have had 50/50 experience with the food. One time we got the Arancini, and although the flavor was good, the rice itself was hard, maybe not cooked all the way. But last time we went we got the Nachos and they were on happy hour so I think it was only $10 and they were a great snack and so worth it.\n\nSo definitely give it a try, the drinks are great, fun place to bring a date or small group of friends to start of your night, and totally the place we should be supporting."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNaMC-FrGl_NQQebBPZp2PqrMzELpZygriNAJl6\u0026fid=0x0:0x641e1455134a9e30""],""When"":""2024-3-31""}]",

The food was just as impressive as the view. We ordered the family platter, and it was a perfect choice for sampling a bit of everything. The spanakopita and moussaka were the stars of the show—both were so flavorful and cooked to perfection. The chicken breast was also a standout, wonderfully seasoned and grilled just right. Tzatziki was fresh and tangy, and the salad was well-balanced and paired nicely with the heavier dishes.\n\nOverall, Taverna Greka is a gem with delicious food, welcoming service, and a great view.

Finally made it here.  Chinese food can often be quite greasy but this food was not, and I loved that about it.\n\nThis location in New Westminster is the second location of Dragon Bowl. I love how the bowls are customizable. There are options for omnivores, vegetarians and even vegans. You can also get bubble tea drinks here. Dakasi bubble tea was in this space previously but it seems that you can still get their drinks here as all of the cups have the Dakasi name printed on them.\n\nThe people working here were friendly and polite; however, I do think they could have been a bit more helpful when it came to food selection. My bowl of food came with a \""vegetable\"" soup and as they knew that I had ordered a Vegan bowl I would have thought that if the soup contained meat in it, they would inform me of it. It was only when I sat down to drink my soup and saw pieces of meat in it that I realized it was not a meat free vegetable soup. I ended up giving the rest of the soup to my daughter. Also, there was a bean curd product that looked like noodles which I selected for my bowl. This item turned out to be quite spicy. I was able to tolerate the spice level but with any food item that's spicy, I think it would be good for a shop to give the customer some warning about it. My daughter was sharing this bowl with me, and she had more troubles than me with handling the spice level.\n\nAside from the soup and spice blunders, I did enjoy the food here and would most certainly come back again. I chose to go Vegan for this visit but the marinated egg looked very tempting so I may choose to go Vegetarian next time!\n\nService: Could have been better\nParking: Free parking on the side streets\nLocation: 406 6th St., New Westminster"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOhv-p8o0JSSCIY7ZJ61K51RtabMNYKQ8qAzPRr\u0026fid=0x0:0x960f0029ed7dff68""],""When"":""2024-3-28""},{""Name"":""Ads"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVwDyuvQtXP_VygmU1rNXhUJ0mc48E4h1QtDkdEfrlXmuS-mYhL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""谢谢 Xièxiè!!\nWow, phenomenal flavor and super yummy traditional and homemade classic Chinese cuisine at reasonable fare with a plentiful serving.

From the minute we stepped through the doors we were greeted warmly and provided with friendly, knowledgeable service from the wonderful staff. We decided to do tapas style so we could sample more items and had the trio of salsas with their homemade tortilla chips, a trio of tacos, the best brussel sprouts ever and the cornbread with jalapeño jelly. Every bite was just perfection and we left stuffed! My only regret was that I was too full to get some of their churros for dessert…I dream about those things…sigh.

It’s absolutely delicious and brings a wave of nostalgia. 5/5\n•\tChai: Easily one of the best chai I’ve ever had. 5/5\n•\tVada Pav: Authentic Mumbai-style, served with mirchi on the side. 4.5/5\n\nThe food is extraordinary, and each dish feels unique. The menu itself is very good, they wrote their story which is inspiring,  and descriptions of each dish, giving diners a deeper connection to the food.\n\nThe decor is inspiring and distinctly Indian. The large Shivaji wallpaper is an eye-catching centerpiece, and the walls are decorated with vibrant paintings.\n\n✨One unique feature stole my attention —a display that automatically changes numbers every 30 seconds when a person follows on their Instagram. It’s innovative and something I’ve never seen before, not even in renowned places like Chef Ramsay’s restaurants. Whoever came up with this idea is a genius!\n\nThis place offers a truly authentic vibe and stays true to its word of filling not just the stomach but also the soul.

Similar to Gujarati food I’m most familiar with.\n\nI’ve had a few days to think this over and I really want to support VadaPav, however there are a few concerns I wasn’t pleased about:\n- the service was quite slow and bringing out the starters at the same time as a main was surprising but not all our meals came together too so it was a wait for the rest to appear especially when you want to start a meal together.\n- Unfortunately they didn’t have the items I wanted on the menu: “We’ve run out” which didn’t seem possible as we went for an early lunch. They did however suddenly have one starter at the end of our meal once the owner came to talk to us. Not complimentary of course.\n- the prices, imo, are very expensive for the little quantity I personally ordered. The stainless steel plates looked empty compared to the photos on the picture menus (see photos for my order).\n- there were 3 of us adults, we ordered 2 mains and 3 starters. No drinks. Our total paid was $110. Again exorbitant for the little quantity of food received.\n- the signature VadaPav is tasty (and so glad no onions) but think it would be better if the two tiny bread rolls were warmed instead of super cold?\n\nI hope they take my comments to note and I really do wish them well."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP_QVK_SOoH9TBcCvx8-a9fF9eVlkjXlM1osIDF\u0026fid=0x0:0x4f70b6c0bdafc7a9""],""When"":""2024-8-2""},{""Name"":""Jasleen Kaur"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJq_mX4JcS2qCxDJUdxLM5cEoBdw7wYfyUdfHLGfdunsmqsnw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This was my first time visiting this restaurant, and I must say, it was a delightful surprise!

There were a few tiny chunks of diced onion in the mix with the coleslaw. And there was no truffle mayo either. The fries were also somehow completely wet and soggy.\n\nI paid over $25.00 for slop and unfortunately did not get refunded. I do not recommend this restaurant."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPFa-AiBhNRJPZ_aWRdJc_bTImbiCeEALqEdEkB\u0026fid=0x0:0x45bc8c7fe1685e53""],""When"":""2024-7-8""},{""Name"":""Theresa Smith"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLecCztY_pXmy93BikSwe6M0XhZAjBKcATWBvCksY1zqc7aJw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We recently went here with friends while we were in town for the Grey Cup.

Almost nowhere to park there except a few paid spots here and there.\n\nWhen we came in we were greeted quickly and our server came to take orders fairly quickly as well. Then it all went downhill from there.\n\nWe ordered the prime rib medium rare. Although the color was great, the top of the steak was all dried from sitting there too long after cutting. The meat was also tough. The soup was broccoli and bacon and it was quite salty and the croutons were stale. We got the lattice fries which everyone raved about. The fries were ok but seasoning was only on a few.\n\nWe also ordered the seafood pesto fettuccine which claims it has lobster. It came with a lot of tiny shrimps and imitation crab. No lobster meat to be found. I thought for almost $30 for the pasta, there'd be some lobster bits. The garlic bread was good and the pesto sauce was delicious though.\n\nWhen we were done, we wanted to get the bill and pay. Since this bar only allows one server per table, no other servers were willing to serve us. We waited over 20 min for our server to notice us looking at her.

We noticed right away that the falafels were made fresh to order and was still crispy by the time we got home (we did take out as there are only 3-4 seats at the front). Beside the fryer was a large pot of fresh rice sitting on the stove as well. For salad you can choose to have a little bit of everything (lettuce, pickled beets, cucumbers, tomatoes, tabouli, pickled red onions, and pickles). They had hummus and tzatziki sauce as options and after the meat was piled on you are also given more sauce options (hot sauce and tahini). They also offer pita to compliment your meal (great with the sauces). This platter was enough to feed two and we'll definitely be back again to try the desserts."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPK6DRK4bxWIOiSF65jJ0IFzYy5FOI9ASwAnUWY\u0026fid=0x0:0x86639338529f658a""],""When"":""2024-7-19""},{""Name"":""Reimun Shleimun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJu0ZwA_4D35g6GEfkag5GeVQ67VwDP2OSszt_p0L2T_fRSmw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""First time in!

The Insanity was a huge burger with the buns substituted by a full grilled cheese sandwich. For a sense of scale, half a burger is way larger than a regular burger on its own. The burger itself was good. The grilled cheese was simple yet it is everything you expected - crispy bread, cheesy center, and the patty was done well, flavourful and juicy. With that said, I found the 4 layers of bread a little too much carb for the burger's proportion, so we ended up eating the top \""bun\"" separately. Needless to say we were STUFFED after the meal. The wings are pretty standard, what you will expect at most pub-restaurants.

So we went here for the B’day celebration and ordered three Burgers and two free flow coffees. Nice ambiance, nice decor, loads of photo collages of previous customers, and we liked it. Hostess told us we have options for sides: Wedges, Salad, or Onion rings. She did not mention that Onion rings would come for extra price. This came as a shock to us when we saw the receipt later.\nFavorites of the day on the board were super expensive.\nOur burger plate looked beautiful. Crispy potato wedges, but they were cut a little too thick. So, that was a bummer.\nBurger patty was roasted well but it had that meat smell and also was bland with the meat’ish taste. Something has to be figured out that the patties are flavorful and doesn’t have that raw’ish meat taste \u0026 smell. We had to add more and more ketchup and sauce to make it flavorful. This experience did not match with the recommendations and hype we got about this restaurant before our first visit.\nJust to be clear, we have been to more than 15 countries and have tasted good burgers. We know how a good burger should taste like. If there’s a raw’ish meat smell and taste in the patty, then it needs improvement.\nI hope cooks will pay attention to this constructive feedback. Maybe we’ll return in the future, but not sure if we’d be willing to pay the high price.\nOur kids got candies while going out, so that was nice!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNKAdoGyMDW1Nb9wxgVbCbgWw3wTyKIvss0pXEf\u0026fid=0x0:0x658604f2a36fde58""],""When"":""2024-4-7""},{""Name"":""Jennifer Sujin Jeon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI2x7NBj_j-gLckp-nciIaSNSNBBYb6sz_fmEYIT-PfK8Z62Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is a famous handmade burger restaurant in New Westminster.

You don’t have to sit down when going to the restaurant - they will make your food in 5 minutes ready for take out (or dine-in). 10 minutes at most, if they’re super busy.

Lack of flavour and a bit too crunchy for a soft shell crab to my liking.\n2. Tako wasabi. Pretty good, not slimy.\n3. Salmon and tuna sashimi. Decent size and fresh but could use a bit of a presentation even though it’s a take out (all sushi places should STOP putting lemon slices near sashimis, they literally cook the outside of whatever fish it touches).\n4. Salmon, hamachi, chopped scallops, tamago, albacore toro nigiris. Fresh but the toros missing that buttery taste.\n5. Spider roll and futomaki. The futomaki was pretty good. The spider roll was a bit off, maybe because the softshell crab was a bit off.\n6. Deep fried poached egg. Surprisingly pretty good, I actually enjoyed it. I could snack on a couple of these.\n7. Asari garlic butter. It was pretty bland even though I do smell the garlics. And what’s with so much broth? It’s like a guppy fish swimming in the ocean.\n8. Beef teriyaki with rice. The rice could be softer and the beef could be less dry and slightly thicker so it wouldn’t be like eating beef jerky with rice.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the order, the restaurant was pretty quiet with one table of customers. A weird little sense of silence especially late at night in New West.\n\nThe service from the server who packaged my order was okay, although could be more welcoming .

Located inside a mall, the restaurant offers plenty of free parking and a separate entrance from the outside. Initially, the small door from the mall and the dim lighting made us unsure if it was open. My daughter even asked, “Is it open? Why is it so dark in there?” However, once inside, we were greeted by a warm and inviting ambiance.\n\nDespite it being 6 PM on a bustling Saturday, we managed to snag one of the last tables. Our server was exceptionally friendly and accommodating, although she did forget to place our order and my daughter’s apple juice. After a 40-minute wait, she apologized sincerely, assured us she would expedite our order, and offered us complimentary dessert as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived, it was worth the wait. The portions were generous, and I ended up taking some home. I had the roast lamb, which was incredibly tender and fell off the bone. My daughter, a notoriously picky eater, enjoyed her salmon in tomato sauce, possibly because of the long wait. My husband had the lamb souvlaki, and our friend tried the potato-crusted cod—both dishes were delicious.\n\nTo top off our meal, our server brought us ek mek, a Greek dessert, on the house. Despite my usual preference for chocolate desserts, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, Yiannis Greek Taverns exceeded our expectations, and I wouldn’t hesitate to return the next time I’m craving Greek cuisine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN7PQfPHYYweZZsaIMbYUDpVrWoFnfl9YSzp__W\u0026fid=0x0:0xaa8584956b498880""],""When"":""2024-11-10""},{""Name"":""Bob Ilapogu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXD-elaNhBNUvlaxka6eecnsUdCevkSM7CivjrbdDP1sf2qzFrO=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We had a medical appointment nearby, with about 40 minutes to spare.

It was a plump, flavourful sausage that was perfectly complimented with sauerkraut and mustard.\n\nThe baked camenbert was paired nicely with cranberry sauce and seemed to be lightly coated with breading, giving it a nice outer texture.\n\nI enjoyed the goulash, but it was a bit too watery for my taste.\n\nWe got the Schnitzel Champignon, which was nicely breaded and flavourful. However, I felt that there were not enough sauteed mushrooms in the dish. The schnitzel came with a very nice cabbage side, potatoes and some vegetables. The portion size is fairly large, and we shared the one order between the two of us.\n\nFor dessert, we got the black forest cake, which was absolutely amazing.

Worst thing about this restaurant is that I have to drive out from Vancouver to have it! The chicken nuggets are also super delicious.

They are way too salty or oily but I suppose it suits the North American taste more? Nothing wrong with liking that, they're still good, just not authentic. But the beef noodles at Rong Rong are most definitely the closest noodles to actual beef noodles you'd have in Taiwan. (Disclaimer: I am not Taiwanese but on my last trip to Taiwan I gathered recommendations from many locals and tried a different beef noodle restaurant every single day of the trip).\n\nThat said, personally I think the dining in experience is way better than takeout. The noodles taste much better fresh. There is very limited seating, if I remember correctly there are tables for three groups of 2s, one group of 4, and there's one round table.\n\nThere is no free parking (15 min short term parking, only 3 spots) but I have never had too much difficulties finding paid street parking nearby.

I ordered laing and fried galunggong with rice, which they categorized as combo 2. The rice texture was a mix of soft and hard grains. It tasted  like they mixed the left over ones with the newly cooked. The laing was blant in taste and a disappointment, the galunggong was served with vinegar but even the sauce was somewhat plain for the taste. If the management wants to hold of their regular customers, and wants them coming back,  the taste of the food shouldn’t be compromised . Their prices are a bit high and the diners should get their money’s worth with good food tastes. Also, they should refrain from upselling other food products since the customers can view them anyway. If they want to buy desserts or other snacks, they will do so even without the hard sell. As a Filipino we wanted to patronize the businesses of our co- Filipinos but when we feel shortchanged with the service we will be avoiding coming back again buying their goods. Hopefully, I was able to air my constructive criticisms with regards on how they can improve their service to their paying customers. I am just stating a fact based on my experience.\n\nThis is in response to your statement that nobody is perfect which I found very unwelcoming of customers complaints. If you feel slighted on an honest opinion from your regular customer then no one will dare point out a constructive feedback.

Then came a couple of times when the Neptune group took over and turned it into this Japanese restaurant.\n\nIt’s located right across the street from the New West skytrain station. There are a handful of free parking spaces available on its private parking lot, otherwise it’s paid street parking or the parkade.\n\nInside is a pretty basic layout with booth seats by the window, tables to the middle and the sushi bar to the inner corner. Very casual setting.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Miso soup (Complimentary). Nice and hot the way I like it, thank you!\n2. Tako wasabi. Fresh and pretty good, probably one of the best price so far for this dish compared to other places.\n3. Kani sunomono. First, it was too sweet (added too much sugar), secondly the amount of crab meat was almost a joke (come on guys, the prepackaged low quality crab meat is cheap), lastly  the crab meat was dry! (Hint: There’s a new supplier has better and whole crab meat chunks, better and same price!)\n4. Soft shell crab. Decent size, lightly battered and seasoned just the way it should!\n5. Oyster motoyaki. It was okay but I would like it more if they were made from fresh oysters on a shell.\n6. Sakura roll. Looked very promising like a blossom in the menu but in reality just another basic roll with no hint of Sakura whatsoever. (It’s called a Sakura roll, add some pink or red to it!!!)\n7. Red tuna, albacore toro, salmon, chopped scallops, tamago, ikura nigiris. The toro was missing that butteriness, the chopped scallops and tamago were okay, ikura was so so, the salmon and red tuna were dry.\n8. Assorted sashimi. I honestly am shocked on how every piece of the sashimis could be so dry and tasteless. It literally seems like the chef dab dry every single piece of sashimi with bounty paper towels.\n\nThe services here were quite accommodating and friendly, at least during my visit here.\n\nAs for the food, I remember it used to be decently okay, maybe different chefs?! It was somewhat disappointing during this visit; some of the ingredients were off, the sashimis and nigiris were quite dry. This is a prime location for any restaurant in New West and offers great potentials if it offers their customers quality food and service, unfortunately it fell quite short this time around."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM6WO-HJmQ5Qfmhe-gCmZvyKSA1O_y9fMDvWGgj\u0026fid=0x0:0x7a406cca4d557fbc""],""When"":""2024-3-29""}]",

I parked in the mall (it wasn't a good idea). The mall closes at 5:30pm so you might have challenges getting back to the car after dinner.

After leaving a phone message the manager (I think it was the manager) asked me to call orders in b/c the online system wasn’t clear. So I did going forward. The error rate went down to maybe 40% on that dish.\n\nThe problem is when you order take out and find mistakes when you are home, you can’t be bothered turning back.  I’ve gotten better at checking but they are finding new ways to mess up.\n\nLast week they called me to tell me they were out of mashed potatoes, so I needed to pick a different side for the steak meal. Then they proceeded not to bother packing it.\n\nToday again they messed up the pasta order, but caught it. So they re-made it.. cool,  but then the rest of the food was cold. Then they gave me steamed veggies is a plastic bag?? And the cherry on top..  one of the two kids ice creams I received was essentially empty.. it may not have ever been ice cream?  it may have been ice cream mixed with whipped cream?  honestly idk what it was but it was basically empty. The top and sides had stuff on them so it wasn’t obvious till it was opened.\n\nSo while it’s further for me..  I’ll just start going to the kingsway location b/c this one..  they just don’t seem to want my business.\n\nThe food generally is good, when it’s packed right or not cold b/c I had to have them remake something.

So good great taste, very fresh, would 100% get again. Affordable relative to what’s around NW and crave worthy.\n\nPasta con Filetto di Manzo = tomato based with beef chunks, mushrooms. Also super flavourful, a close second and order-again worthy. Beef was a little tough but not enough to ruin.\n\nToast skagen = unique fun and light, sauce heavy. Dilly creamy with full prawns. Would order again but more polarizing than other dishes.\n\nFries = unique, good when hot. Maybe a bit undercooked but I really enjoyed them. Friends said they were a bit sweet.\n\nDrinks:\nOld fashioned = great\nItilia fashioned = gorgeous presentation, tasty and what you want from a alcohol forward gin-based grapefruit drink\n\nApparently more pub favourites to come which I think is a needed guilty pleasure of the residents and this locale.

Stopping in an hour before closing on a weekday, we found the familiar comfort of a well-oiled machine running on cruise control, but we felt like the staff was getting ready to leave.\n\nThe nachos arrived as they always do – adequately portioned, properly layered, neither inspiring poetry nor causing complaint. They're the kind of nachos that make you think, \""Yep, those are nachos alright.\"" The drinks followed the same path of calculated adequacy – they'll get the job done, but they won't make you forget your favorite cocktail bar.\n\nWhere Browns does shine is in its consistency. It's like that old sweater you keep coming back to – not because it's spectacular, but because you know exactly what you're getting. The patio offers a pleasant escape, and the service maintains that professional warmth that's become the chain's signature.\n\nThis Browns Social House isn't trying to reinvent the wheel – they're just keeping it reliably rolling. For a casual meet-up with friends, whether it's lunch, dinner, or late-night bites, it's a safe bet. You won't walk away with a story to tell, but you won't walk away disappointed either.

To be fair, I left myself open minded for my visit. We ordered the house special pho and lemongrass pork and spring roll with rice, and chicken wings for appetizer.\n\nI think the wings might need a little more seasoning in the coating, but the pho and rice were pretty good. I went greedy asked for a large. There was lots of ingredients I couldn't finish! The broth was light yet tasty. Also, I did not feel thirsty after drinking the soup! Those who said it's bland maybe are more used to very strong taste? Spring roll was actually good (though previous restaurant always had the best spring roll in Vancouver theirs were hard to beat!), they used broken rice for their rice, pork was juicy and tender.\n\nServers were pretty friendly (looks like family run), Overall pretty good experience.

It was fairly quiet which was nice. We were seated right away and the server was attentive. Ordered nachos and the beef dip\nThe nachos tasted great, not too salty and just the right amount of toppings. The chips were placed on a piece of tortilla so once yoyu've eaten all the chips, you could fold the tortilla and eat it with toppings that fell into it. Thought it was a great idea. The chips however were not crunchy. It was like stale chips that have been re-baked.\nThe beef dip was good. Good size and flavor. Ordered it with a side of ceasar salad thinking who messes up salads. Well, if you like eating whole cloves of baked garlic, then this is for you. I was not expecting to find a whole piece of garlic clove when I took a bite off my salad and it threw me off. Not sure if it was intentional but not a fan. Who wants to walk around the casino with garlic breath anyway.\nBeing it was a slow saturday afternoon - there were only about 5 tables around us-' we expected the washrooms to be clean. The ladies room was kept clean but hubby was disgusted with the mens room, described it as if it was not cleaned from the drinking that occured the night before. We had to tell the host about it and while he was quick to call someome to clean it, it should have been done without us having to ask them to do so."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNZplm2z0ayKrtqPeLabwFidkci-dviicRQiEx7\u0026fid=0x0:0x960938093c50e642""],""When"":""2024-11-18""},{""Name"":""Lisa Avery"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV0uWvek94xw9hceZaor7-wGRHhxzIOVcSdxuCqWSKZC0HUDQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Friendly and efficient Gill was our amazing server and she was on top of everything.

Thirsty Duck Pub, locally known as the duck, is a pub style restaurant located within a 2 storey commercial plaza located in New Westminster, BC.\n\nThere was a dedicated parking lot located on the

The business can also be easily accessed via public transit, with 3 bus stop routes within 1 block for buses: 112, 101, and 155.\n\nVisited during on a Sunday, we attended in conjuction with \""New West Bar Bingo\"" a summer event typically during the months of July and August where local pubs fill in bingo cards for our visit. This review is independent of this event.\n\nMy server was Sanya who was attentive, provided the menus, and knowledgeable of my inquiries related to specials and food items. The included photos are of the 2 piece fish and chips and Molson Canadian draft. We have also included the specials for Sunday and the specials for the other days.\n\nThere were other activities available within the pub: golf, pull tab, pool.

casino with some friends for the first time in years. The band famous players was on that night. I wish I had the words to describe how amazing they are! From their talented voices to the theatrics and drama on stage , it was incredible. The chemistry between the two lead singers kept all of us engaged. The dance floor was full at all times. If you want a good night out with some good music, I would strongly recommend the Starlight lounge when famous players is scheduled.\nUnfortunately, I wish I could say the same for the service and the food. I had the South Beach salad . My avocado was brown on places and I asked for Caesar dressing and I got mayonnaise. One. I spoke to the waitress. Said she would bring me ranch. The waitress was very sweet but not very good at her job! She would take one order, walk away, do that, and then come back and dig another order as opposed to taking all of our orders and requests at the same time. She would bring us our food but not come back and ask us if we needed anything and we would have to literally wave her down. At times people waited in extremely long time to have coffee, refilled or even another drink order. Because the band was so amazing. I will go back to the Starlight lounge.

The facility, services, and foods at Starlight Casino in New Westminster BC are inferior and way below bar.\n2.\tServices have reduced at Starlight Casino in New Westminster BC  drastically over the past six months. Three of the five small coffee machines have been removed for good. Only the two near the washroom at the far end remains, often broken. IT IS INSULTING TO the patrons when the Starlight Casino in New Westminster management CLAIM MORE SERVICES and were \""excited\"" when they REDUCING them FROM 5 TO 2.\n3.The swiping incentive is useless these days  The rewards have reduced to a few silly credits are insulting . You might as well remove and dump the swiping machines.\n4.\tBuffet is practically closed - some snacks remain. Buffet used to be a very popular and well-liked place to eat and drink. But since the price has doubled, services reduced and poor foods, Starlight casino practically “killed” the popular venue.\n5.\t Most popular slot machines have been removed for good and more card tables added. Less and less patrons could be seen at the Starlight Casino these days. My friends and myself now rather go to River Rock Casino.\n6.\tIn sum, the management of Starlight Casino in New Westminster BC should be reviewed and replaced. We do not want to see it closed which will happen if the present management continues their unpopular, unfriendly and ridiculous services.\n7.\tI am so unhappy that I did not even bother to check my typos and grammatical mistakes as that would just waste more of my time."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNReVZP-w6JDEcHhpnXDFAf0jy6f1qVIOjodzw\u0026fid=0x0:0x20a80f1560b67cf5""],""When"":""2024-7-15""},{""Name"":""Frank Li"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUqU7w4lL0DBsy1BjK_cj8vbNltIdZkHHYfmHo3u05AoSN2BGW5=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I came here for lunch on Sunday.

Service is slow at times, mainly because the place is packed, and there's only one waitress, but it's bearable. We never went past appetizers, but I can tell that wings are good, and mozzarella triangles are nice when cheese stays inside, which doesn't happen always, and you get triangles with no cheese inside. Also, I'm not sure if it's a post-pandemic measure, but now the kitchen closes at 8 pm. For us, somehow missing the last kitchen call, it was the end of the night. One other thing that I really liked, which is not available anymore in COVID-19 reality for very obvious reasons, is that they used to have a popcorn machine where patrons could get a free popcorn – it's genius. I can't say that this pub is perfect, but they are trying to be so, and I can see why many locals like it.

The mac and cheese sauce was not thick, very cheesy and spicy because we got some added. This was probably one of the best mac and cheese i’ve have in the area. The chicken bites were well coated however there wasn’t much flavour in them so I wouldn’t recommend unless it’s for children.

Drinks are good too. We ordered the nacho and beef sliders. Well, the food was not very good at all. The nacho was cold and not a lot of toppings. Cheese has congealed and did not have that classic stringy pull. Oh well. But the good news was that we brought it home added more cheese and banana peppers and warm it up in the oven, and it came out perfect. 👌 The sliders were very dry. The bread was like a few days too many in the freezer. Well again, we brought the sliders home, we swapped out for fresher buns and made our homemade beef patties, and the sliders turned out perfect 👌.  I want to like this place because it is only two blocks away from our house, but I rather walk 30mins to Match for better food or just cook at home. 🤷🤷🤷"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOIymzm0hgCDF6KJmyCEiZzrJ2TVP_a_JereGCN\u0026fid=0x0:0xc6da18482b0cdfa7""],""When"":""2023-5-7""},{""Name"":""Lorna Holmes"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWLGTiz7X8ca9yPQGHnezPpPq3Z134oRRYTfLLhiDOE2Wbgxc-9=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Always a pleasant experience in my lovely neighbourhood pub.

My last visit here was all the way back in 2012.

We got the cod and snapper ($21.95) combo which came with chips, coleslaw, a dinner roll and butter. Then we added the 3pc prawns and 2 pc oysters (+$10.75). We also got their signature soup ($6.95).\n\nI forgotten how thick the batter was on their shrimp. A bit too much for my liking.  The oyster batter was thinner. The soup has halibut, bacon, tiny clams, and veggies in a thickish chicken broth. The dinner roll is quite dry and cold but ok when dipped in the soup.\n\nThe fish and chips here is serviceable but mid-level at best. The fish was either cooked a bit too long or wasn't the freshest as parts were a bit dry. Fries were lightly crispy but some also seemed quite limp. I ordered a ginger ale and it came out super flat. I mentioned this to the waitress and she poured another glass which was pretty much the same. Must have been something wrong with their machine so they just gave me a can instead.\n\nThe place was actually fairly busy when we visited. Also noticed a strange odor inside.

I ordered the Pulled Pork Bliss Brunch, and it was absolutely divine. The pulled pork was tender, well-seasoned, and perfectly balanced by a touch of sweetness from the pineapple. I enjoyed making an open sandwich with it, which was delicious, and the fresh berries on the side were a thoughtful and tasty touch—both visually appealing and a lovely contrast to the savory pork.\nMy friends ordered the Salmon Sunrise Benedict and the Atlantic Delight. Both dishes were outstanding. The salmon was perfectly moist and flaky, and the eggs were cooked just right, with that runny yolk that made for a rich, natural sauce. The Atlantic Delight, similar to the benedict, had a delightful combination of flavors, and the addition of bacon provided the perfect contrast to the salmon’s delicate texture.\nAll dishes came with soft brioche buns, which I would recommend toasting a little more for a crunchy texture—this would elevate the meal further, especially when paired with the tender meats and rich eggs.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe vibe at Banette is bright, warm, and inviting—perfect for a relaxing brunch. The bakery section by the window is a clever touch that draws you in and lets you gaze at the freshly baked goods. The space is cozy, which means it’s ideal for smaller groups (6 people or fewer), but it can get a bit tight with larger parties. Nonetheless, they’ve made excellent use of the space available. It’s a great spot for brunch with friends, family, or kids, and the perfect place to grab a coffee and pastry if you're looking for some peaceful alone time or a cute date spot.\n\nService:\nJenny, the owner, was incredibly sweet and welcoming. She went out of her way to make sure we had a wonderful experience. When one of my friends was waiting a little longer for his order, Jenny kindly offered a croissant on the house. It’s clear she values feedback and customer connection—especially since they just opened this month—and we really appreciated her warm, friendly service. Her smile truly added to the overall experience.\n\nOverall:\nWe will definitely be returning to Banette! It's a fantastic spot to support local and enjoy great food, wonderful service, and a cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!\n\nLet’s support local businesses! 😊"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNPObAI-_09H2HqDU-neWby_KZA2Iojq8rCKktO\u0026fid=0x0:0x230c373358ec5343""],""When"":""2024-12-24""},{""Name"":""Jason York"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW2KL5JJiTZL1QVt_3AcqILQXXBIuqDWdYOdj3lYENvavlAma6S8A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""What a beautiful grand opening on Dec 14, 2024.\n\nThe pulled pork bliss brunch had a scrumptious mound of delicious pulled pork on a piece of ciabatta bread baked in house.

The wasabi is made of the real one, not the mimic horseradish. The staffs were really friendly.\nI understand the frustration that some of the other reviewers expressed - e.g. minimum charge of $15 per person. When you have kiddos it seems unreasonable. However, for two of us, we easy ate over $80 there (ate too much, now groaning), the $15/p seems not a difficult thing.\nMy favourite: tori karaage (fried Juicy boneless chicken), Tobiko nigiri sushi (flying fish roes), masago nigiri sushi (smelt fish roes), aji butterly fries, dragon rolls."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO50I8hjv88AxZ0A7I3a6Io1fcEeUCHlCM4aDAI\u0026fid=0x0:0xebc91fe3fe1ee168""],""When"":""2023-9-8""},{""Name"":""Rebecca P."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWOtv1z9oQXsu_j8G9uE8jVQGZlbdGZfOgnrsP8gOev0iFfifM3=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very delicious and fresh sushi!

I’m so happy this restaurant has many options!\n\nI ordered many things, some for me, some for my husband at home\n\nFor my meal I ordered:\n\nMushroom veg sauce with jollof rice: In the most complementary of ways, this was like a friend’s mother made you a home cooked meal that was meant to uplift you, and it did. The mushrooms were firm and flavourful and the mixed veg was firm but well cooked. The sauce was delicious! The jollof rice was fabulous.\nFried Plantain: SO GOOD. Crispy and sweet and dense.\nFresh pineapple and ginger juice: ginger really kicks in this drink and it was lovely.\n\nTo go:\nPistachio Croissant: my husband told me this was the best ever for him. The inside is filled with pistachio cream and the top is completely covered in pistachios. Well priced for the decadent nature.\nChicken Curry Patti: really good\n\nPlease note it does take time to get your order as it is made-to-order. This means it will be fresh and perfect textures, this is a win!\n\nI can not WAIT!

Well worth it. Rooms are very clean and despite being in the heart of New Westminster right on the water, it is not loud at all.  The AC provides white noise but bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.   There is 1 level 2 EV charger for those with electric vehicles.  Highly recommend."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNLw4llB2yv4HnhbOvAuoine2jZZZt5wMHehvK-\u0026fid=0x0:0x7da59db8243cb015""],""When"":""2024-9-2""},{""Name"":""Jackie’s Law"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUszzOqI_r931gkNL0kGramN4TG_x4gsqPklTIBKTOEpgOmyBOj=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Located by the riverside in New Westminster, an unique hotel on the out skirt of Vancouver, that takes about 30 mins to an hour subway ride to the city, the fun part is get to see the real lifestyle of the city.

I couldn't resist mys self to try this Thaali. I am big fan of Indian Thalis.\n\nThey said, You can choose any Curry from their menu for Thaali, which surprised me (that means they make  fresh curry for only for your Thali). I have chosen non-veg Thali (13.49$) option which comes with one veg and one chicken Curry (no lamb and shrimp included in Thali), one plain naan, Rice and Raita. I have selected Karahi Paneer (veg Curry)  and Chicken tikka Masala ( non-veg Curry). The ambience is good, very clean and good service. The food is not at it's best but I can say it's worth for the given price. It is far better than eating junk food by paying 20$ on your work day lunch. The paneer Currey is 4 out of 5, but they should work on chicken tikka masala. I didn't find any taste in it. But the quality of food is good. The naan is very plain, they should offer Garlic naan to make the Thaali more tasty. Rice is of good quality they have used. Raita is fresh. Overall I am not disappointed,  although I expected a better Chicken tikka masala which is a basic chicken curry in any Indian place and it shouldn't go wrong.\n\nOverall I appreciate this restaurant team for their efforts to offer Thali at such low price yet quoty food. You don't even get a burger or sandwich from McD  for that price in these inflation days. Also, the girl at front was friendly and did good job.\n\nI wanted to try Chana bathura next time.\n\nThank you."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN0XMLgOx4y_8kqS_FWesvvQNTC3Funx6F9Rev4\u0026fid=0x0:0xf0212ded0051493f""],""When"":""2024-6-13""},{""Name"":""Sathiyaseelan Suhashini"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWGCDhZwAvUF3Q8iMEpEx8TQCvKbwiXzYFJN0uOrenEt7v0wxGX=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Loved the sweets which are delicious.

However, sure enough, the deal was still there when I checked online. When I went to pick up the pizza, I asked and the employee said that the deal is “online only”.\n\nWhen I got home, we read the fine print and it did not indicate anywhere that this special is “online only”. My husband went back to the store to confirm and the employee tried to argue that I had ordered the “recipe pizza”. Eventually they admitted that you CAN get the pepperoni pizza with the special so there was no reason to charge regular price for it, especially since I had referenced the special.  Eventually, my husband was given a $5 refund (the total difference was $5.65 lol. Oh well, by now, the amount we were owed was no longer the point).\n\nAll that to say, if the employee had charged me the regular price by mistake, I wouldn’t be mad. But to lie and say the special was “online only” to avoid honouring the deal is pretty scummy.\n\nAn email to their corporate office did not yield anything besides a scripted apology and response saying they will forward this to the appropriate team to address with the individuals involved.\n\nAll in all, pretty disappointed that none of the Pizza Pizza representatives proactively tried to make this right.

It deserves an 8 out of 10.\n\nOverview: Dana Pani Indian Cuisine stands out as one of our favorite Indian restaurants and a hidden gem in the area. We visited for a quick bite and were thoroughly impressed by the quality and flavor of the dishes.\n\nFood:\n\n•\tAppetizer: We started with a large portion of vegetable pakora. These were excellently prepared, with a perfect fry and a well-balanced seasoning blend. The appetizer sets a promising tone for the meal and merits an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tMain Course: We opted for the Tiffin Thali, a diverse and satisfying selection that included both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, rice, naan, and raita.\n\n•\tPalak Paneer: This dish, a staple of North Indian cuisine, features paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a rich, flavorful spinach-based sauce. The spinach is blanched and pureed to a smooth consistency, then sautéed with onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes, along with a medley of spices. It was expertly prepared and rates an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tChicken Tikka Masala: Known for its vibrant orange color and rich, creamy, spiced tomato-based sauce, this dish did not disappoint. The balance of flavors and the aromatic quality of the sauce were excellent. It earns an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tChana Masala: This dish features chickpeas cooked in a spicy and tangy tomato-onion gravy. It is a staple in Indian cuisine, celebrated for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. While tasty, it lacked the depth of flavor found in the other dishes and receives a 7 out of 10.\n\n•\tButter Chicken: A personal favorite, this dish featured a creamy, luscious sauce with tender, delicious chicken. It stood out as the highlight of the meal and deserves a 9 out of 10.\n\nAmbiance: The ambiance is modest but comfortable. While the space is small, it is adequately maintained and provides a cozy setting for dining.\n\nPrice: The pricing is very affordable, making it an excellent option for those seeking quality Indian cuisine without breaking the bank.\n2/5\n\nVerdict: Dana Pani Indian Cuisine is truly a hidden gem and one of the best Indian restaurants in the area. The variety and quality of the food are outstanding, and the affordability adds to its appeal. For those who enjoy spicy food, it’s worth noting that while the dishes are flavorful, they cater to various spice preferences, offering non-spicy, medium, and very hot options. Overall, it’s a restaurant we will certainly return to and highly recommend."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO5yhzePV_P4zOnZyLnxZOBpAWD7VNYor1BubP0\u0026fid=0x0:0xe029e562e7fb717a""],""When"":""2024-6-27""},{""Name"":""Chris Lochhead"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJuiipc_xz9ET6nJtGoC_1SL7eafro7oB6Q-WiHyZ8PyZyITQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This place is a hidden New Westminster gem.

She gave us a sample of her Mango Mousse. She was thinking of adding it to their already delish menu list and ask us to send her a feedback. I wanted to send her my input on it but I didnt get her contact. Hopefully this will able to reach her? The Mango was so fresh and big chunks was a real bonus, which I am sure people will appreciate because I certainly did! The cake layer was soft and not dry at all, and the buttercream/ganache/creamcheese, not sure what the cream was made of, super delish! I found myself kept on scooping until its was just the empty cup left. It was not too sweet nor bland. A perfect taste of a great dessert.

The chicken was so tender and flavorful that it melted in my mouth. My only regret was not asking for the extra kick of calamansi and chili. It would have been the perfect finishing touch.\n\nAs a side, I indulged in a heavenly tortang talong. It\nwas a nostalgic taste of home, reminding me of my Nanay's cooking.

The sauce of the bbq kept the skewers tasty and all the meats were very tender, even though we served dinner a few hours after delivery. I told our guests that when ordering from NK, they are always very consistent in flavours and presentation is beautiful. NK also had great communication with me which I really value from vendors and they delivered within the time agreed upon. I like the fact that orders can be placed by credit card online and way in advance. Saves me the hassle on a busy day.

now and I am fairly certain I'll be back again to get this elusive flan (I haven't been successful yet).

I had the 3 tacos with chorizo, carnitas, and fish as my meat and I chose fries as my side. Husband ordered the torta with chorizo and my friends had the tostadas and fish Baja tacos. Our food came very quickly after ordering and we were given extra sauces on the side to add as we eat. All four of us enjoyed our food and the atmosphere. We heard good things about the dessert flan but both times they were sold out.
