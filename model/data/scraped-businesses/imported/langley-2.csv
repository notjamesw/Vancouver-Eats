Omni, where we had the pleasure of being assisted by Luke, was nothing short of excellent. His service was top-notch. Very attentive and gave us a good bit of knowledge on how certain things came to be on the menu.\n\nThe food was amazing. Super glad we began with the starter chicken bites as the house sauce was delicious. Moving onto the main courses, the cajun honey glaze mac \u0026 cheese with beef was incredibly filling and had the perfect amount of spice in it to give it a bit more flavor. Very heavy, but so tasty.\nThe chicken Parmesan was also cooked very well. Not my meal, but I had bites and I definitely would order it myself.\n\nI think that Luke and company have something really special here and I am very eager to come on back and try something else."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOGb8n7ae8J1saMml4QcGYMtnrVwlujcowe2Gw0\u0026fid=0x0:0xb69e31edfea8c6f5""],""When"":""2024-10-20""},{""Name"":""mikayla schneider"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK9ytTAwuelhxrLWhPzheXBmt7RewcKxL5Xs2Lokw9VuE5vgQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Paige was incredible today!My girlfriend and myself have had some questionable dining experiences lately, and Omni was a refreshing new place for us.

There's bocconcini which has a goat cheese like flavor with mozzarella notes which added to the overall experience. The garlic oil added to the overall taste and wasn't overly oiled. The chef did a fantastic job balancing these elements together.\n\nThe spicy chicken burger had small notes of spice which accentuates the chicken. The burger has a great balance of vegetables and was well seasoned.\n\nThe Omni burger was the highlight, the bacon was well cooked without being oily. The smash burger was correctly smashed and was well seasoned. The patty was very fresh as was the bun.\n\nThe truffle fries were spot on and amazing, the poutine was well made but the bowl style plate made the poutine suffer. If the poutine had a wider bowl, the top cheese curds would have been able to melt better. But the curds that did melt was really good.\n\nThe peach Bellini was sweet but might have been a bit too muddy for my liking, but if you prefer a more alcoholic experience, this is perfect.\n\nTheir signature drinks like the electric blue was amazing and definitely worth returning to have again.\n\nOverall the food is really well made especially with the price point, it's clear that this establishment has put extra care in delivering quality food.\n\nSome bonuses to note was that there is dairy free, and gluten free options, including plant based patties and plant based options for pizza too.\n\nFinal notes: A quality place, one of the only places you can get a good smash burger. I would consider this place more of a restaurant than a bar, I would consider the food too good to be considered bar food. Additionally, I believe they should advertise and highlight their smash burger as not many establishments provide smash burgers. The chicken burger is excellent and my co-reviewer even preferred it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPHJ7aeBqWUqh1JaZh2Y8LzcZsqmL9Qq038Phss\u0026fid=0x0:0xb69e31edfea8c6f5""],""When"":""2024-10-1""},{""Name"":""Ursula Galvão"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXnsRxiZN0DybNpuvqmxWQWm-edIin_sVOWzR85r44e8kPLlSM5=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Incredible food and service.

Restaurant interior is small but modern and welcoming,  service is great - The owner Luke was very friendly and came over to introduce himself and chat and gave recommendations for some dishes.

Fort Langley\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nWe had an early dinner at Beatniks Bistro with my parents, and it was a delightful experience. The ambiance was cozy yet modern, making it the perfect spot to relax and enjoy a meal in the heart of Fort Langley. We were seated promptly, and the staff were attentive and friendly throughout our visit.\n\nThe menu had a great selection of dishes, and there was something for everyone. We started with the crispy calamari, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. For mains, we had a mix of dishes, including the short rib and the salmon, both of which were cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. The flavors were balanced, and the portion sizes were just right. My parents really enjoyed the experience as well, and it was a lovely way to spend time together.\n\nWhat stood out was the quality of the food and the relaxed atmosphere. The outdoor seating area looked inviting too, but we opted to sit indoors given the cooler weather. Overall, Beatniks provided a wonderful dining experience, and we look forward to returning.

As a local resident, I rarely explore Fort Langley, a heritage village that mainly attracts tourists. Our initial encounter with the first waitress was lovely; she was friendly, took our orders promptly, and served our drinks right away. Unfortunately, she did not inform us of her shift change. The second waitress who took over was regrettably rude and unprofessional. Despite her assurance to refill our water twice, she never returned with it. Although we ordered promptly, we waited 35 minutes without any food. When we finally flagged down the waitress, she explained that there had been a mix-up as she assumed we had finished our meal. When our food finally arrived, it was a mixed experience. My wife's gnocchi was good, but my fish and chips were disappointing; the fish was undercooked and frozen, making it impossible to cut. The manager, who was very positive and kind, offered to replace my meal for free.

place and was pleasantly surprised. The first thing that stands out is the friendly staff and the calm, cozy atmosphere that immediately makes you feel comfortable. We ordered breakfast: a bacon omelet and avocado toast. The omelet was juicy, although there was a bit more onion than expected. Unfortunately, the coffee selection was disappointing—only drip coffee is available, which doesn’t quite match the overall quality of the place. However, the ambiance and quick service make up for this shortcoming. The photo spots were also a nice touch, adding a special charm to the venue. If you're looking for a place for a quick and tasty breakfast, I recommend it.

The rim seasoning was delicious, and the little snack stick was quite hearty compared to other places.\n\nThe virgin ceaser, poke bowl, and lettuce wraps (lettuce wraps were an appy menu item) was over $50 before tip. (I believe it was low to mid $60 range.)\n\nLettuce wraps - the chicken was good, nice, and saucy. Personally, I'm not a fan of cucumbers, so I just kicked those to the side. Thoroughly enjoyed that it was ice berg lettuce vs. romaine hearts, etc. The mayo sauce was also delicious!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Poke Bowl and said it could have for sure used some more fish and rice for what we paid for it. Wasn't a fan of the mushrooms as they were an odd texture. (Just kicked those to the side) Fresh avocado and eggs were done just how he likes them!\n\nService was good. Our waitress was friendly and hosted a conversation well. She answered all of our questions and triple checked our concerns with the ingredients list. (Severe dairy allergy)\n\nThe atmosphere was loud even tho we were tucked into a cozy corner, it was just loud.

It’s fine I said since it’s a whole chicken breast and seasoning was just on the outside.\nI asked the server by chance if the oysters were out only for happy hour, she said nope gone for the whole day. (Just thought I’d check.)\nWe proceeded to order dinner. We got the wagyu carpaccio which in itself was good and the capers understandably would be salty.\nThen our main came, I got the flat iron with creamed corn and Yorkshire pudding. My husband got the sirloin creamed corn green beans and added a lobster tail.\nMy steak was super salty I had to scrape the seasoning off and my husband’s steak a New York striploin which was supposed to be rare “Chicago style” was medium rare closer to medium. Not sure what happened for our steaks to be cooked that way when the price tag is at that level.\nAnyways what got me disappointed was that being out of “oysters” turned out to be false cause you guys ended up having 5 bags of oysters restocked at 5pm, I know cause I saw them pour bucket fulls of ice and then open the bags.

Each dish was meticulously crafted, showcasing a creative blend of flavors and textures that highlighted the versatility of plant-based ingredients. From a vibrant appy to hearty mains, every bite was a testament to their dedication to quality and taste.\n\nEqually impressive was the service we received. Despite being their opening day, the staff were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the menu offerings. They accommodated our requests with a smile, contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe beverages, including the hot drinks, were also commendable. Expertly prepared, they complemented our meal perfectly and were a delightful addition to the dining experience.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Grounds \u0026 Greens Cafe leans towards the pricier side, which might be a consideration for some patrons. Nonetheless, the quality of food, exemplary service, and the overall ambiance make it a worthwhile dining destination in Fort Langley.\n\nIn conclusion, Grounds \u0026 Greens Cafe has firmly established itself as a standout option for plant-based dining in Fort Langley.

We arrived around 4:30 pm—busy but not crowded—and ordered some chicken wings in two different flavors, fish pakora, and a glass of wine. Perfect for satisfying our cravings!\n\nFish Pakora - Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and paired with their house-made chipotle sauce that’s simply amazing! (5/5)\n\nChicken Tandoori Wings - The smoky flavor is spot-on, and with the mint sauce, it’s a treat for the taste buds. (5/5)\n\nChicken Schezwan Wings - Good, but could be a bit spicier and juicier. (3.5/5)\n\nWine - Complements the meal well! (4/5)\n\nWe also love the warm and friendly ambiance, and the staff who is friendly and warm!There’s a happy hour, and they seem to offer something new every day. This wasn’t quite lunchtime or dinner, so we didn’t get to try more, but whenever we’re in Langley, we’ll definitely be back to explore the menu further!\n\n—————————————————————————\nWe loved the food and ambiance here! We visited around 1:20 PM, and it wasn't crowded. They offer a daily buffet until 2:30 PM.\n\nFood: The starters are amazing and the buffet is worth the price, with special mention to the fish pakora, tandoori chicken, and chicken samosa - all delicious. 5/5 They also have quinoa salad, mac and cheese, and other dishes as well.\n\nMain Courses: The buffet includes butter chicken, naan, veg pulao rice, baigan ka bhartha, yellow curry, aloo palak, chicken curry, and lamb curry. We particularly liked the butter chicken and lamb - 3.75/5 while the other curries were decent but less spicy - 3/5\n\nDesserts: The buffet also had gulab jamun, rice pudding, and tea. The only thing is gulab jamun was broken and they all tasted good, especially the chai - 4.5/5\n\nApart from the buffet, I ordered coconut prawns and a lime mojito. The coconut prawns were absolutely delicious - 5/5, and the mojito was well-balanced without too much ice - 4/5\n\nService: Ishika helped us today, and we really liked her. She approached us with a warm smile, offered timely help, suggested good food choices, and also informed us about the happy hour. She has pretty good knowledge about the drinks and good. We'll definitely visit again to enjoy the happy hour with more friends this time.\n\nAtmosphere:A quiet, fine-dining ambiance. I really liked the jade green chairs, clean washrooms, and the spacious occupancy, suitable for parties and team lunches.\n\nOverall, we had the best experience and would rate it 5/5."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipODIlFxf0jKmU0WhAlie3MnmfPJk0UGHxP2yJuS\u0026fid=0x0:0x7e3802fbec3226f2""],""When"":""2024-5-23""}]",

Can't say I got my worth this time but at least I got the chance pick berries. Detailed review below:\n\nBurnt ends (1 lb) - I think this was a borderline scam.  I was excited for brisket burnt ends, but all I got were super small cubes of brisket flat that were not caramelized but just covered in sauce - you just see that naked grey coloured meat covered in red sauce.  However the worst part is (you can also see in the photo) that it was 70% sausage.  I don't understand what justifies the price they are selling at, $27.99.  The sauce was pretty good though.\n\nBeef rib - Singular rib that had smoke flavor but was dry and needed the barbeque sauce.  Overall, impressive looking but was not it, $31.99\n\nPlatter for 2 - Got this the last time and the star of the show was the pulled pork, last time it was the brisket that was juicy, smokey, and moist.  However, this time the brisket was dry and lacking smoke flavour.  The sausages were plentiful as always.\n\nMac n cheese side - Saw it being made fresh, nice southern flavor with smokey spices. Overall, it feels like a Velveeta based cheese sauce with smoked paprika.\n\nCornbread (jalapeno) - Nice fluffy, moist, and flavorful cornbread, but no jalapeno flavor, not complaining but there's almost no difference from a regular one. Kind of unfortunate that I liked the cornbread more than the brisket and beef rib this time around."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNRm0Lpp7OrziOMUDrC2MxSIwf628NWaDxniiT9\u0026fid=0x0:0xc337a3f74351b29""],""When"":""2023-7-28""},{""Name"":""Kelsey McAuley"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKnAzavtz8qT6KmCgwueB6IQD6a-EXZK-ht_DFi_J60y91Dtw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is the closest thing to true Texas BBQ in the greater Vancouver area that I have ever tried.

We ordered the platter for 2 and everything was super filling , it even came with pickles on the side 🫠🤤.

to Sammy J for the first time.  The experience was less than desirable.  Lady was nice when ordering or drinks.  Took over 20 minutes to get our drinks.  Ordered the chicken strips for my son and steak frites for me and my wife.  Waited another 30 minutes for our food, which is normal with the restaurant pretty busy. Drinks were empty and had to wait another 20 minutes to her news drinks.  The chicken strips were so dry and burnt. The veggies coming with it were dry and old.  The steaks were over cooked, dry and full of nerves.  It was like eating a leather belt.  Fries were good. But it's an expensive meal when an establishment don't care what's coming out of their kitchen.

There are parkings available  in the plaza parking lot. Inside is a bar section to the left and a dining section with  booth seats and tables to the right.\n\nHere were the food I ordered after scanning through the menu;\n\n1. Original Caesar drink. It was okay, needed to be drunk before I say it’s good.\n2. Cream of tomato soup. It was hot, rich and creamy. It’s one of those you either like it or hate it, but I personally find it a bit too paste like almost like pasta sauce.\n3. Wings and drumettes. It was on the small drier side with a southern hot sauce.\n4. Panang curry mussels. The sauce was okay but the mussels meats were a bit overcooked and small. Felt like another one of those frozen prepackaged ones.\n5. Mini cheeseburgers. The patties were pretty dry.\n6. Coastal salmon. That’s one thing about sockeye salmon, once overcooked it will be dry and powdery, needed some mastery skill to get this dish done right.\n7. Cajun chicken linguini. The sauce was okay but the linguini was a bit undercooked.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was casual but the noises projected from the bar section were quite loud.\nThe service was okay and pretty straightforward from the staffs, tho could be a bit more attentive.\nAs for the food, more of an old school pub style and a little on the drier side.

There is potential and I hope the restaurant isn't too proud to adapt to their customers comments!\n\nI will return to try their broth, but if that has similar flavor issues I will not return.

From our initial appetizer to the chicken wings, it became pretty obvious this location is a big fan of small portions. In fact, our spinach dip came with a very tiny serving of Nachos. It can barely serve a single person! Plus, our serving of wings was so tiny. It lacked any meat and seasoning. Due to the bland taste, we complained to our server. She eventually took back the wings to their kitchen. About 10 minutes later, she returned with the same COLD wings with a side of extra seasoning. They refused to cook us a new batch of wings and expected us to sprinkle seasoning over cold meat! We refused the wings and removed it from our bill. The manager did not even make an effort to approach us or correct their mistake. What a total insult.\n\nOverall, we refuse to support local businesses that insult the intelligence of their customers. The Wings Langley location has definitely made that list. Cooking a decent set of chicken wings is not rocket science. Stay away from this overrated place, unless you like to be treated like a 2nd class citizen.

Their wings are truly massive and packed with flavor. The meat is always juicy and cooked to perfection. While some reviews mention the prices being slightly high, I believe the generous portion sizes more than make up for it.\nBased on other reviews and my own experiences, the Honey Garlic, Salt \u0026 Pepper, Korean, and Roasted Red Pepper wings are all fantastic choices. The Korean wings pack a flavorful punch with a balance of sweet and spicy, while the Roasted Red Pepper offer a unique and savory twist. As for dipping sauces, the classic Ranch and the tangy Blue Cheese are always winners.\nTo complement the wings, I highly recommend trying the Fiji Blonde beer on special. It's a light and crisp beer that pairs perfectly with the bold flavors of the wings.\nWhile the service is generally friendly, there's room for improvement in terms of attentiveness during busy periods. Also, some have mentioned the wings can be a bit dry at times.\nOverall, Wings Langley delivers on its promise of big, delicious wings with a wide range of flavors to choose from. Despite a few minor areas for improvement, it remains a top spot for wing lovers in Langley."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

The dinner sets are also delicious, and such good value. The seafood salad is also delicious,  perfect for a solo entree.

this restaurant and support them so this is a tough review to write. We have been multiple times with disappointing experiences.\nThe food is always delicious, beautiful and inventive. IMO they create some of the most inspired vegan food, done well. Poutine, pancakes, lox charcuterie board, Caesar salad are all fantastic.\nOur issue is with the service. Multiple times we have arrived to find that they are out of many or most of their options (hours before closing). This would be acceptable if they didn’t seat us, take a drink order, bring the drinks and then inform us that they are out. Once, they only had 2 menu options left. Two.\nThe most recent visit, I called ahead to ask if they were still serving and was told no problem. Again, we were not informed until we tried to order the unavailable items. When I mentioned this, the server said they would never tell us over the phone if they are out of options.\nI recommend their food but would order ahead for takeout or be sure to dine in first thing on the morning."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP8dVkl0nBJK7r8DQ5WOcAyF6rrQsxYkzf8m-uW\u0026fid=0x0:0x2d5f31ba0b655de6""],""When"":""2024-12-6""},{""Name"":""Daniel Jung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFE7g6vnjf23CW6mDeh4anchF8fxBs6O5Nsx0bvhepuO3MVzWa=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""First time here.

Ok ... The last thing I'll add is that it's also a great place to bring kids (old and young) for a shake, ice cream or a dessert. My 5 year old had the kids size ice cream which was a scoop of ice cream (I think they had 18 flavors to choose from that day) and it was topped with whipped cream, gummy candies and cotton candy (for $3!).

The taste of the beef patties and gravy was not what I was accustomed to and it fell short of my experience. I love mac salad, but this also tasted different in a bad way.

I miss having eggs and fried chicken, so I was pleasantly surprised to find specific vegan options here. The vegan egg was a solid substitute; while not exactly like the real thing, it was impressively close. The vegan sausage was decent, though it would be great if they offered dairy- and egg-free chicken sausage as well. The smash potatoes were my favorite, though next time I’ll remember to request them extra crispy.\n\nThe place was packed on a Sunday morning, but we were fortunate to snag a table as one opened up. With the rush, I hesitated to ask if items like the chicken sandwich could be made dairy- and egg-free or if the buns contained any allergens. Ideally, I would still like to enjoy chicken, bacon and some sandwiches if they can be made egg and dairy free. Might be wiser of me to call ahead next time. For anyone without dietary restrictions, the menu is an absolute treat, with plenty of mouth-watering options to choose from."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNxR2IJYsTiMg99iExxUEDcPq9Yc5Po6MQTyveL\u0026fid=0x0:0x145c8f4a8245af3a""],""When"":""2024-11-13""},{""Name"":""pranav malhotra"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUSL5eeGcXR0Jz-YBh5IzstngyuiPHOiOg7aMPejaDXK3jwMy1bDg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""A very inviting and attractive place with fantastic food and beverages.

The bread for the sandwich was stale, the chicken in it took up less than half the sandwich. The fried chicken was basic and overpriced. Best part was the fries. Church’s Chicken is 10x better than this place. They’re also paying people off with discounts for good reviews. As you can see in the picture. The staff Do Not wear beard nets/ hair nets. When we came in, the staff on break were spread out on most of the tables forcing us to eat on a high top in the corner. So no respect for their customers.

Our waitress was watchful and attentive.  Dietary requirements are carefully considered and we appreciated the extra caution.  We were not rushed at any point.\n\nAs mentioned, the food is excellent.  A nod to tradition is notable in such items as the spring rolls wrapped in rice paper.  The salad was not overwhelmed by dressing and the chicken wings were fully cooked without being dry.

November I returned after a more traditional experience = lasagna and Tiramisu; this was time to *try* something: Squash and Brie Canelloni and Canoli(last two pics.)\n\nThe Canelloni is an incredibly creative blend of flavors- truffle, maple, squash, brie, spinach- AND green apples on the side- not for a Normal-seeking palate. I had a Moment on first bites at the sheer range of flavors and how well they melded; I found it was really well done.\n\nI followed my entrée with a Canoli- I think fairly well done. It had more of a \""fair food\"" essence(fried) than I would seek out but I took my time and could definitely appreciate the rest of the flavors.\n\nService was pretty good, just depends who you get and how busy the restaurant is!\n\nI still enjoy the ambience- quieter music than previous time, apparently at some of the [few at that pre-supper hour] guests' requests, but noise has not been Loud either time. It's been a few weeks and I'm hoping to return[again] soon.\n\nPrevious review, Nov. 8th, 2024:\nIf you want details on food, server and atmosphere(and first two pics.):\n\nI ordered the lasagna and, as mentioned in answer to one of the questions here, I found it smaller than I expected(takes up space width-wise but is shorter than what I expect from lasagna) and tasty!! So, a bit confusing on that note, and for $31+/-.\n\nI finished with Tiramisu- the lasagna was easy, and then I found the mousse quite heavy(kind of to be expected...ish) that, while the flavor was soo good it was hard to put the spoon down(!), I didn't get very far before taking the server up on a take-home box. I enjoyed some warm tea for the heavy mousse later. 😄(Lasagna gone before thoughts of a pic. dawned on me!)\n\nServer Keira was just right in not hovering but also attentive enough to ask how it was as I progressed and promptly notice I needed a water refill. Her table-side manners were so approachably professional that I was quickly at ease- and at Friday supper time!\n\nWarm but modern design inside- balance between low-grade pub and stiff-and-expensive. Lower lighting this Fall eve., but brighter for window-side tables. Music loudER but it wasn't overwhelming as I thought when I walked in the door. 👌\n\nI would like to try other dishes- cannelloni, pizza?? And mayyybe another dessert in the near future? 🤤🍽"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPe5WGld991JNFkPAdN0SZSA11X7gUGjVSe5oLX\u0026fid=0x0:0xa8a72d1e570d4071""],""When"":""2024-11-9""},{""Name"":""Debbie Tuit"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUl1QRhiGTE0pawpm2Mt3BIssODHhrthbrxd62Ea1dwXPs0h0E=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Cannot say enough about this fabulous restaurant.\nWe are staying nearby and walked over just as the restaurant opened.

First things first,  with a name like banchan, I kinda expected to have a lot of banchan (little side dishes) or maybe unique or different banchan. Instead, we didn't have any banchan. Not sure if it's due to the dishes we ordered or if they just don't serve banchan.\n\nWhat we did order was the LA kalbi dupbap which came with brussels sprouts. Good flavour to the ribs but the bowl could have used some other veggies.\n\nWe also had the seafood pancake. This had a thickish batter which was a bit crispy on the outside.  Inside, it was mainly veggies and not much seafood aside from the large chunks of octopus.\n\nThe spicy rice cakes that we ordered were tube-shaped (like tteokbokki) and slightly fried giving it a bit of texture to the bite.\n\nThe soy and garlic KFC bites were Boneless and quite meaty.\n\nOverall, food was pretty good but I kinda missed having actual banchan dishes"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPs_Di9fkj6279_KJJn6onIVJA5bnhlAsxLUtoz\u0026fid=0x0:0xcfe58da922a51b8d""],""When"":""2024-6-2""},{""Name"":""Pilo News"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFId9ZdkkvXmcYiLmTK0bEP9YVRba_LZHmLxWEpHSLdGMlepoT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Banchan’s chicken dishes are a standout, showcasing a perfect balance of flavor and tenderness.

Here’s a fun and inviting Google review for The Mad Italian:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n“The Mad Italian: Where Pizza Dreams Come True”\n\nIf pizza is your love language, The Mad Italian is your soulmate. I walked in expecting a meal, and I left feeling like I’d just had a spiritual awakening (but with way more cheese).\n\nThe pizza? Unbelievable. I’m pretty sure they’ve hired a wizard in the kitchen because I can’t explain how they’ve managed to make crust this perfect. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside—it’s like biting into a cloud that’s also been to culinary school.\n\nAnd the service? Out of this world. I thought I was a regular person, but after five minutes, I was convinced I was royalty. The staff treat you like long-lost family, the kind you actually like.\n\nDo yourself a favor: Stop reading reviews and get to The Mad Italian. You’ve got pizza dreams that need fulfilling, and this is the place that can make them come true. You’ll leave full, happy, and slightly convinced you’ve found the meaning of life—hint: it’s pepperoni and their house made ranch dipping sauce and chilli oil!\n\nP.S. Don’t ask for the ranch recipe….They won’t tell you. Believe me, I tried."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNLYeqKv7TPyJmNvJ-HZrD0vKmVf4LVUceBOAQD\u0026fid=0x0:0xa114619d66dfcfb3""],""When"":""2024-10-22""},{""Name"":""S.

They have a wide selection of different variations of “pies”. My go-to being, the Margherita or Vegetarian (love the freshness the arugula gives). I also appreciate how they have an option to create your own, although it’s not very obviously advertised. The only reason for the lack of the last star is that: one time I was ordering with someone who is gluten sensitive and we saw there was an option for them on the menu. Labelled as “gluten-friendly” or something of that sort, yet still contained gluten and wheat, just less. Long story short, they couldn’t enjoy the pizza with the rest of us because of false (or not clearly specified) advertisement.\n\nFeedback for the company: Ultimately, I believe that they shouldn’t bother with any gluten related titles. As it can be deceiving and potentially harmful. If they want to cater to that group, they could make one that is actually gluten free.

I ordered the 1.29 onions add-on... I counted 18 tiny pieces of diced onion.  Not really worth it at all.  I will say that the potatoes weren't terrible in any way.

The plate was overflowing with thick ham, three pieces of thick-cut bacon, and long, flavorful sausage links. Every bite was a delight, with the meats cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor.\n\nThe Texas toast was a highlight as well, especially when paired with their proprietary strawberry jam. The jam had a fresh, homemade taste that added a perfect sweet note to the meal.\n\nAnd let's not forget the bottomless coffee – a must-have for any breakfast enthusiast. The coffee was rich and smooth, and the fact that it was bottomless meant I was well-caffeinated and satisfied throughout my entire visit.\n\nOverall, Stacked Pancake and Breakfast exceeded my expectations.

The food, to our standard, is good. We enjoyed the various dishes available, and the food are generally made well. The cleanliness of the place is clean. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and there is calming music playing in the background. The interior décor and bathroom is, well, basic. The price is reasonable for what is provided. Be warned that if you waste food, they will charge you $10 extra, so take only one scoop or piece if this is your first time trying. I notice many say this place isn't good.

The service was fantastic! We were served with hot tea as we got seated and our orders came pretty quickly. We ordered the teriyaki dishes and I had Salmon Teriyaki while my husband got the Beef Teriyaki. We both were very satisfied with our orders but for me personally, i loved how fresh the salmons tasted. You can tell the freshness of it because it melts in your mouth and just really good quality. The teriyaki sauce tasted really good as well, it’s not overly sour and not too salty. For me, this by far is the best Salmon Teriyaki I have ever had. Price is definitely worth the quality, But, I hope they don’t do price increase so we can go back and enjoy their food again. One last thing, our server was really friendly and she was efficient! Thank you Hitori for the good food!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOW6gWdUtwOLj0qe8RZXlmU_l7W80QYVCMtj4gZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x446931c67a16a72""],""When"":""2024-5-25""},{""Name"":""Camilia Rodriguez"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWigkoqaNhHJinW1sDEWmiP5-QkCbLl16QFp5xZiy1DDMYI0dmUuQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is our go to Japanese place in the area and for good reason.

In this day and age you will definitely not find Pho for under $10 in Vancouver. The regular size (small) bowl of pho at Naomi is priced at a low, low price of $10! Now don’t expect to be stuffed as the bowl is small (similar size to what you’d actually get in Vietnam) but it’s a decent size if you’re just wanting to enjoy a light meal. If you’re hungry than get the large size or order some appys and share with your friends and family.\n\nI ordered my usual (Bun Bo Hue) and it’s decent here. I’m only saying that because if you’ve seen my other reviews I have high expectations for BBH and I have my favs around town.\n\nI am intrigued with their other menu items as they have Banh Xeo and Banh Cuon. I will definitely try one of these the next “movie night”.\n\nOverall a good experience with the food, service was meh as we didn’t receive much attention and no tea refilled.\n\nRay’s Tips:\nCheap Pho $10!\nFree Parking\nCredit card Accepted"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMwu9tBI4x2H4Vwi-t1UIPbZi099lx3og8UREFK\u0026fid=0x0:0x72fc0b51f114e524""],""When"":""2023-9-22""},{""Name"":""Atamjit Bassi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-CCAG1d3JAdmNUSxxvmUHR8304lfHA6Q1xca1y5nzjuQ4NkRBIw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Service was quick when we went in during peak lunch hours but food is mediocre.

What made this place stand out to me was the quality of the meat; it had the taste and texture of a higher quality meat than you usually find in most places. The texture was actually a real meat texture; it felt rich, as opposed to something previously frozen and limp. Also had the fried spring rolls and everyone was correct: I think these are up there with the best I’ve had in Vietnam.\n\nThis place is a hidden gem. And it will personally be my new ‘go-to’ in Langley. Looking forward to trying some of their other soups and dishes."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPhKfG0fsbN48vvdq6OmWKDCBtmy-Y0fIYc2UT_\u0026fid=0x0:0xe6869299035276c6""],""When"":""2024-4-7""},{""Name"":""Diane (Dineoutwithdee)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVJfHVJSjIKAcPEXNIfUcWAtOeYHaXavqJYPtVJZ3lhCbCbpeo=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Big fan of this place!

I arrive 25 min later, then I drive home and I get them open and go to eat them realizing the dough is all torn up, they put plastic containers of vinegar in with the hot dumplings so the lid melted and the vinegar spilled all over, and there was not 1 single dumpling that was sealed. When you see these pictures, I wouldn’t even serve them to my dog! This is not even the biggest piss of though. This is WHY I’m writing a review. I called the restaurant and told them I would send pictures. She stated I needed to return the food in order to get a refund. The restaurant is a 40 min drive. Then she proceeded to tell me I did not order Xiao long bao and that those are Chinese not Cantonese, when we CLEARLY had that EXACT conversation on the phone. It wasn’t until I wasted my gas at almost 2$ per liter to drive the dumplings back up to her, that she gave me back my money. Not 1 penny more.

It really helped to make the atmosphere of the place feel so welcoming and homey. Now onto the food, absolutely incredible! The burger was very tasty and was served with crinkle cut fries, I got the breakfast with sausage and bacon, it came with toast and shredded hashbrowns, i got gravy on the side and it did NOT disappoint!

We were so impressed with the immediate greeting from the kitchen and also from the server that guided us to a table.  She was very helpful and suggested one of their most popular dishes which was the Jerusalem Mix Platter which consisted of an assortment of lamb, chicken and beef skewers.  They were very accommodating with our change of the dish as we did not like lamb and they replaced with another beef skewer.  The dish was served with either rice or home made fries … we had the rice but I also ordered a medium side order of the fries - they came out piping hot and was so fresh and delicious.  It was also accompanied with 2 choices of salads - we ordered fattoush as we were not partial to Tabouli salad (parsley).  Pita bread also came with the meal served with hummus and garlic dip (so yummy)!!! The meal also comes with a soft drink for such a reasonable price of $25.99.\nThe chicken and beef kebab skewers were both flavourful and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely go back and try some of the other tasty dishes from the menu.

You can order food from the pub menu or the restaurant located directly next door. Some things to be aware of. It can get busy when they’re are tournaments in George Preston arena. Quite often you’ll have individual customers sitting at a table designed for six customers so not great if you’re showing up with a larger group for dinner. Some of the seating has to conform to the layout so some areas you feel like your sitting in the hallway or a revamped recreation centre. There are no exterior windows…not a big deal in the winter but in the summer it has the bunker affect. The food is well pub like the restaurant food on the other is acceptable but a bit pricey for the quality. Would I order the overtop expensive Tomahawk steak? Probably not, it feels risky for the cost/value. I have ordered $45-$50 steaks? Yes and honestly they were okay but just okay a little disappointing if your spouse can make a better steak at home for considerably less. Yes, I have eaten at the Lodge and this a review of the Horse and Ryder but when you can order from the same menus regardless of which location you dine in it’s hard not to merge reviews. By the way my favourite pub menu item is the fish and chips. If you live in Brookswood and you don’t want to drive to WG to The Keg for steak it’s worth checking this place out just ask questions and be fussy if you order a steak and it’s not acceptable for what you paid for. If your looking to have wings and beer and possibly watch the real “Men With Brooms” it’s not a bad local spot."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPaXqMxkRARFPuIZokaC0SxPD1ZlFU4uuWuqtqI\u0026fid=0x0:0xb245bfb988363a45""],""When"":""2023-6-18""},{""Name"":""Sandy Vorberg"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXRUnDlnJ9QoM0O9p2qDa5khVLT8gY3YyZXkZ6lUfwaAS-FLXY=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Second time here at the “new” location at George Preston.

This was a major letdown, especially considering the premium price we paid.\n\nAdditionally, the sides we ordered were cold by the time they reached our table, which only added to our dissatisfaction. To make matters worse, it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive, making the experience even more frustrating.\n\nOn a positive note, our server was kind and attentive, doing their best to make us comfortable despite the kitchen's shortcomings. However, the hostess left much to be desired, as she was neither welcoming nor friendly when we arrived.\n\nTo compensate for the poor experience, the restaurant offered us two free desserts. While the gesture was appreciated, it didn't feel like a fair resolution considering the overall disappointment with our meal.\n\nOverall, The Lodge Steakhouse did not live up to its reputation. While the service from our waiter was good, the issues with the food and the overall dining experience make it difficult for me to recommend this restaurant.

John and Liz were our waitstaff for the evening and made the exquisite food appetizing and extra appealing before we even got a first taste. Chef Jason provided an amuse bouche that I wish I could remember the details of but I wanted to order MORE of that delectable morsel of flavour explosion.

Each dish was fresh, flavorful, and had us wanting more. For the main course, I went for the surf and turf with steak 🥩 and lobster 🦞. It did not disappoint. The steak was cooked perfectly, with those beautiful grill marks that make your mouth water just looking at them.\n\nAll in all, Atlas Fish is a great spot for anyone looking for a good meal with a side of excitement, thanks to the casino next door.

I started off with the Vegan Spicy Poke Bowl which was pretty decent but the rice was cold and tasted like it was old, hence, the clumps. It also could've used a sauce to bring everything together. So, I ordered another dish to compensate as I was still hungry.\n\nThe Vegan Crossed The Road burger was the highlight of my meal! I wish it had more vegetables but other than that I could not complain because I would come back just for that burger alone. It converted me into loving pickles, specifically bread and butter ones.\n\nAlso, I do not recommend their tomato soup. It tasted very smoky.

But they have hidden charges, badly made and overpriced cocktails, and food is hit or miss. I have had way better experiences at other board game cafes. 💸💸💸\n\nI was very excited to visit this unique local business and check out thier restaurant concept combined with board games but unfortunately several issues made my experience fall short. First of all, I did like the fact that there was someone to greet you at the front of the store and help you pick out games so that you could have a more catered experience, I would have liked to be able to browse the games to try myself but it's understandable that you must have an employee grab them for you. When it came to the restaurant side however, there were several red flags🚩🚩🚩. I had high expectations due to the local sourcing of ingredients and the fancy sounding menu but the water buffalo burger I got had a pitch black patty and was so dry and smoky that it just tasted burnt. My drink, the Villanous Peach was horribly made and had 4 little ice cubes floating in a giant glass of mixer, overly sweet and unbalanced. For $15 this cocktail tasted worse than something I could get at a dive bar. Speaking of cost, my server charged me $1.50 when I asked for mayo, which isn't a problem, but he never informed me that the mayo was going to be a charge until I got my bill. Had I have known, I probably would not have gotten it. I will say others in my party had better luck with the cookies and cream milkshake and chicken and waffles. Although the shake was smaller than expected for $9. Lastly, my partner found a small glass shard floating in his beer glass and unfortuantely our server never came by to check on how our drinks were going, so all these details were missed. Don't think I will be going back here when there are other similar businesses that can offer a better experience. 😕"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOmLRkNJtOJAofSobYaUlKb275f__hinPLshujD\u0026fid=0x0:0xac6c6e3cd1e43c32""],""When"":""2024-6-21""},{""Name"":""Jae Song"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVSc1rzM1iBcqd5dfL1F2O2cQ7gAXV2IiZ66G1iMGHfoS2xgoio=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This place is a must try!

a basic, affordable breakfast on a rainy day. The place is packed full of artful creations and art work.

I had the 13 dollar and change breakfast that was delicious. Unreal sourdough toast and delicious hashbrowns. Farmers sausage was cooked perfectly and my Sunnyside up eggs were just as I had hoped. My gf ordered the 12 dollar and change pancake breakfast and was equally as pleased with everything on her plate minus the pancakes. They were without a doubt edible but bland and tasted like mix. The peanut butter cookie bar/square we purchased to go was stale, crumbly and disappointing. Again, this will not stop us from enjoying this incredibly cute, quaint, homey, aromatic and \""general store-esque\"" breakfast stop in the near future.

Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations.\n\nParking at the Langley location can be a bit of a challenge, but we know the area so that was expected. The restaurant itself is simply furnished, with nothing special to make it stand out.\n\nWe placed a takeout order online, saved 5% (no problems applying the code at checkout), and the order was ready at the indicated time. Service was friendly.\n\nWe ordered pork spring rolls, pork salad rolls, and the following sandwiches: lemongrass chicken, honey garlic chicken and sate beef.\n\nThe spring rolls were delicious! Crispy and not overly greasy.\nThe salad rolls were nothing special. Even the dipping sauce was not very flavourful.\n\nWe ordered all sandwiches with extra pickled veggies, no cilantro.\nThe bread was nice and crusty, but not as special as some of the reviews make it out to be. Unfortunately, the bread to filling ratio was way off.\nFilling was sparse, including the pickled veggies, which we'd ordered extra of (would hate to see what it's like without the extra).\nTo top it off, one sandwich had full cilantro, and another had obviously had the cilantro picked back off, since there were still some leftovers. In this regard the sparse filling was helpful, as I could quickly pick it all off without anyone else seeing (and getting ideas in their head that they could still taste it...). Honey garlic chicken was quite tasty, sate beef was okay with just a tiny little bit of spice, and the lemongrass chicken was rather bland and full of gristle.\n\nPictures are of the honey garlic chicken and sate beef (1/2 sandwich shown; full sandwich size is about 10\"")."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPQiywV8J_89aLLCVDPF9RAbuwR1Ba_5FcjYjTO\u0026fid=0x0:0x8604466a1d06f9d9""],""When"":""2024-6-21""},{""Name"":""Your Dad"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUsCraod052SzzpZMGY6lo4iWb9TrGcmdDrZnPN4UP7KVLJzFAp=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Fresh is the best adjective to describe this restaurant.

spot while thrift shopping and thought we'd give it a try, especially since it saved us a drive. The place has been newly renovated, but the ambiance feels a bit empty. Service was a little off—we weren’t greeted or given menus, which made me wonder if they’re more of a takeout spot. I felt like we might have been intruding, though the staff did share a few friendly smiles.\n\nThe prices are a huge draw! They have specials like $2-3 slices of pizza and a mango lassi for just $2.50. I ordered the Chana Bhature and Chat Papdi—both were delicious, well-seasoned, and the portions were perfect! I couldn’t even get a photo before diving in—I took a bite of the Chat, and my friend took a bite of her dish (a chickpea curry, I think), because we were so excited to try. 🤣 She also picked up a slice of pizza to snack on, which was ready to go but tasted pretty average, like festival pizza.\n\nWe tried the mango lassi, which was lighter and a bit tangy compared to others I’ve had. I enjoyed it, but my friend, who’s Indian, found it bitter and not quite to her taste. At $2.50, it’s still a great deal, so no complaints there!\n\nOverall, I’d recommend this place for its great prices and tasty Indian dishes. A solid stop if you’re in the area and want some good eats on a budget!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNVysvx9_wETLG8tdduhPP23pJifz6hCY8XmlHT\u0026fid=0x0:0xfe93e59823a4b076""],""When"":""2024-10-31""},{""Name"":""H.S"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLVawwjI3jTBIIuypRD-ffWOyIXBKBmow9aZMxBrnuyi0sbPA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""So glad I dropped by here to get some food on my way because its right next to the bus stop.

trip to Langley, BC, and decided to try something different for dinner. As a fried chicken aficionado, I noticed John's Chicken House was nearby my hotel, so I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nThe exterior of the restaurant is unassuming, resembling an older fast-food structure. Inside, it was sparse with a large counter for ordering. The young lady who took my order was friendly and efficient, and in a short few minutes, I had my takeout order.\n\nI opted for the 4-piece dinner combo with a mix of spicy and regular chicken. The combo came with a small container of gravy that tasted a bit off and a small coleslaw that was almost negligible.\n\nThe real stars were the chicken and the French fries. The chicken was decent, but I couldn't really tell the difference between spicy and regular. The thighs and legs were well-cooked with a coating of crispy batter that had little taste besides salt. I relished it, though, as I was hungry after a long day of driving.\n\nThe fries were tastier, with a crisp crust that surprisingly went well with the slightly \""off\"" gravy.\n\nI probably wouldn't visit here again. It was an interesting experience, but I believe there are better options nearby, like Popeyes down the road and even the Canadian version of KFC.\n\nThe cost of the meal was expensive for what you actually get.

The idli sambhar was light and flavorful, and the vada pav and pav bhaji reminded me of classic street food done right. The jini dosa and sada dosa were crisp and paired perfectly with the chutneys. The set korma was rich and satisfying, and the chana puri was a hearty, comforting dish.

I tried their combo rice plate which came with grilled pork, lemon grass chicken, meatloaf (ground pork, wood ear mushrooms) and a fried egg on top of rice. This was a large portion and will fill you up if you’re hungry. Also came with a side of broth.\nI also ordered Banh Cuon which is steamed rice rolls with a pork filling. This could be a light meal on its own but we shared amongst three people.\n\nService was friendly and quick.

It’s very rich of beef and kimchi flavours. It’s quite spicy though so be aware if u can’t handle the spiciness.

Let me state up front that this place definitely earns a 5/5 on G maps: stands out amongst the crowd of Indian restaurants around just because of one dish.\n\nBut before I get to that, let me get the not so great out of the way. The appetizer I had (I think it was the lollipops but I'm not sure — pic attached) was a solid 6.5/10. Spicy, sweet, salty, savory, but not much else going on in terms of flavor. It was somewhat tender though.\n\nThali was a 7/10. Lentil curry was good but not great. The chicken curry makes up for it though.\n\nTheir magnum opus and what keeps me coming back is their Biryani as many of their G maps reviews mention. NINE POINT FIVE out of 10 with sauce even after coming here multiple times but 6.5/10 without sauce. Seriously, use a generous portion of the white sauce; it's included and refills are free.\n\nI would say that Indian spice profiles are high risk, high reward. If you mess up, the food will taste disgusting even to the most unpicky eaters (I'm one of those). But if you nail it, the dish will take you to flavor town and back; and back to flavor town and back. And this restaurant nails it with their Biryani.\n\nIn addition, their rice is always perfectly cooked: fluffy and soft, yet the grains are individually separated and not falling apart. It's just a bit dry, but that makes it perfect when paired with curry or sauce (as you should) as it won't get mushy as easily.\n\nThe atmosphere is adequate: clean, and there's signs of effort placed into aesthetics. It's definitely not fine dining.\n\nServing size: huge. Expect to be full after only an entree. They can definitely serve 1.5-2 people.\n\nSummary: definitely come here for Biryani if you want some Indian food without destroying your wallet with those Michelin recommended restaurants."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMwps4_fdX4YjQlgVqT04e8Of9DFXlLJMVfYrE\u0026fid=0x0:0x97c7d84b6caacd36""],""When"":""2024-3-3""},{""Name"":""vishnu viswanathan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkkvVnC4XYZ0OswhnAV1UJR62w5i_u7SRPGRlZgiLQTTivcWcp=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I ordered chicken 65 biriyani for a group.\nAbsolutely loved the Chicken 65 Biryani!

Let's talk first about the portions of different items on the plate. Over 95% of restaurants, mall food courts, takeout places and other eating establishments will fill your meal (plate, gyro, sandwich, wrap etc.) with fillers. This takes the form of all the cheaper items such as rice, pasta, hashbrowns, bread and other simple carbs. This place does not! It is the first restaurant in years where we did not have to request \""easy on the carbs\"" and \""more meat please\"". The portions on our plates where perfectly balanced with rice, salad and lots of meat (see photos for details).\n\nThe before-meal Greek salad was very tasty with was not overloaded with onions. The Bruschetta was wonderful with light perfectly toasted bread. The Mixed Grill was an excellent way to experience three meats: chicken, beef and lamb. All meats were moist. The chicken and beef were tastier than the lamb. Please note that the lamb is not the same as Roast Lamb and instead is the lamb likely used for Gyros. If we're being picky, this lamb could have used a bit more flavour. The rice and mixed vegetables were perfectly sized and with tons of flavour. Even the pita slices were warm with drizzle of oil.\n\nService was excellent even with a slight language barrier. Do not be deterred by South Asian staff and chef in a Greek restaurant. The Chef has over 10 years experience in cooking this type of food and it shows! It appears to be a family-run business. There was adequate street parking directly in front of the restaurant and a free parking lot across the street (which was mostly empty during the lunch hour). We felt that our meal was very reasonable given the portion sizes and taste. We shared an appetizer and ordered two meals (one from lunch menu and one from dinner menu). We did not have any drinks other than water. With taxes, the total meal was $52 not including a tip.\n\nThe restaurant has been open for 9 months. They have over 500 Google reviews. We hope they stay. It is simply outstanding and you should give it a try!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNQ9We5CoKH0WRTWGcsxTC_raymMN6WD9aK79Te\u0026fid=0x0:0x73d141e3ab072493""],""When"":""2024-7-23""},{""Name"":""Cayden Gillies"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK-qMY7VbcVg2__MwHI9cGdDcZkgGsaRwvmpR0qTWVodE6vyA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service was really excellent.

The dishes were a 10000/10, taste and presentation wise. We are true admirers of Greek food and this restaurant by far, exceeded our expectations, and we have eaten at many others! This will be our new go-to for dining in if we crave Greek food. Great to know their location is only 10 minutes away from home. We are a bit shocked that there are negative comments about the restaurant because even when it came to our baby, the host (which I feel was also the owner) made sure he was taken care of. We were given a high chair, his own plate, cup, and even a book and popsicle after he ate! For me, that’s great customer service! I highly recommend for others to give this another shot. Maybe it will work out better for you this time around as it seems they really took all your constructive feedbacks to heart; to better improve their business! We love, love, love Ella’s Greek.

It has changed quite a bit. Strange new decor though. Very modern, which doesn’t really go with the rest of the place!?? And of course we miss all the old staff. They definitely were a big reason why a lot of people went to bobs. Anyway. The first thing we noticed was it seemed very dirty. The floors, windows,. food, utensils, napkins on the floor, and even the tables were not cleaned. Our condiment bottles were even kind of gross. So that alone was bad enough. And it wasn’t busy. So someone could have been at least tidying up. Then they had country music playing quite loudly. Which I am not a fan of country. But I dealt with it. Lastly, the food. It wasn’t bad. My rice was bland. But that was my only complaint. My husband didn’t like the gravy. But again, not a big deal. So the food so far would have us come back. But my concern is, if the dining room is that dirty, what does the kitchen look like!?? So that is my only hesitation to return there. I will probably try it again.

No matter how many face lifts you give a place you need to still produce quality goods and Bob’s is missing the mark. This last time has done me in for ordering food. There was so many mishaps this particular Friday night from screwing up the reservation to running out of steak. Servers not remembering to bring items requested. I realize the restaurant was busy on this particular occasion however there is no consistency on how this place runs on day to day as same goes for food quality. There is no consistency week to week.\n\nExamples of the evening: Ordered yam fries which came out and served cold… reheated to be served overcooked\nOrder placed for a steak but sold out so replace with prime rib which was served cold and under whelmed with cooking of it..\nOrder placed samosa appetizers, asked for a sweet dipping sauce was offered plum.. I am allergic to pitted fruits so declined.. server argued back there’s no pit in the sauce…asked for sweet chili dip was given hot sauce asked again for sweet chili sauce and took 30 minutes to get a dip for 2 small samosas.\n\nI do commend the atmosphere or vibe of the place because the changes made to the building show some nice growth and opportunities towards improvement."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Anastassiya Kunitsyna"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUtvTKMqeWu6OVW3uNRzqNVD2yKDfmNlPsgC5aGS1stmGlnbwk=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had a Christmas party with our coworkers, and everyone really enjoyed it.

Some of the BEST Indian food I've ever had and that says a lot as I grew up with it living where I do. Initially, my boyfriend and I were going to get a light meal from a Japanese restaurant but we ended up parking nearby other places. So we figured why not check them out! We hadn't had Indian food in a restaurant in a month and decided to go with Vaades. And we did not regret it. It exceeded our expectations for being a spontaneous choice. Although it was humid walking in since there was no ac, we forgot about it after drinking a glass of water. Our server was friendly and accommodating, and happy to fulfill any requests. For instance, extra sauce, more napkins, water refills. We felt taken care of and I loved the small touch of the utensils being wrapped in thick napkins, minus the clear tape. The washroom was also clean and spacious. Now on the topic of what really matters, the food: I ordered the baingan bharta, my boyfriend got the lamb and onion curry, and we shared the crunchy okra because we've never seen anything like it. They piled our food high! You can call it a plating issue but we were ecstatic to receive such a great portion with how delicious it was. The starter was in small crispy pieces and had a lovely sauce to accompany it. My curry was so creamy, had my preferred spice level and my naan was cooked perfectly and fresh. I ended up packing my leftovers for work and it tasted just as good the day after. We will definitely be returning here again when we're in the area. I would give it a 4.5 star rating if I could :)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM0XD_Ej81c7eZVbv1Z58gY_l05bSu-5CoLFI6o\u0026fid=0x0:0xe007072e6d585b59""],""When"":""2022-8-6""},{""Name"":""possible dreams"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWxIa3BzWqnXDQUO8jtY20RLIc-e_dcFVWRfnXKg4PTTzFJReRSSA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Had an early dinner here with my kids and the food was delicious !

For what I'm paying, the portion has been reduced in half (literally half of what is seen in the picture from 2 months ago) in the mixed donair plate and it isn't fresh! The food today was just barely warm and not hot. The meat was dry and clearly just kept on the \""hot\"" table prepped from hours before. This is the 2nd time in a row now.\n\nSalad dressing taste like the krafts italian dressing (quite sure thats that it is) - was never found of it to be honest but it did the job.\n\nWouldn't recommend coming here anymore! Much better donair/shawarma places in Langley and Abbotsford.\n\nThis review and picture was from 2 months ago: So glad this opened up in our area! Their food is amazing! The chicken is seasoned to perfection and the hummus is one of my favorites as it's not the typical plain old hummus with just tahini,  salt and minimal garlic like most.

Food was ready in a decent amount of time. About 30 minutes for takeout. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They had a few people waiting around dinner time.\n\nThe chow mein was average, the barbecue pork fried rice was great and full of flavor but had an insane amount of peas, the almond chicken was good with an unusual twist, they sprinkle sugar on top, in all my years of ordering Chinese food no one else has done that. They blend the sugar with the crushed almonds for the topping. It reminds me of the sugary coating on donuts. It actually tasted pretty good.\n\nI was not a fan of the honey garlic pork. My usual place in Surrey puts on a generous coating of sauce leaving a pool of sauce in the bottom of the container. They're all sticky and dripping with flavor and you can spoon the excess sauce in the container over the food on your plate. But the honey garlic pork at this place was almost dry. I couldn't taste the honey or garlic at all.\n\nI also wasn't a fan of the size of the pork pieces in the honey garlic pork. For me the smaller the better. I like the nice crispy ones. The pork chunks here were very large. I got a few super long ones the size of chicken strips. They should be diced much smaller. The pieces were so large it just wasn't appetizing.

Deliciously crunchy, but not greasy.\n\nRestaurants have gradually been raising prices while dropping quality and shrinking portions. It was pleasantly surprising to find such good portions (it is $27 for one box so not exactly cheap but you don't feel scammed).\n\nWorth going back to try more flavors next time.\n\nThe only issue I had was with young (under 8) kids in the dining area the staff decided to blast 'In and Out' by Lud Foe (a heavily explicit, uncensored rap song).

Although I would love to support this business because they offer to feed the homeless... I just... I can't. I called to order for pick up, after giving all the order details I get hung up on. I call again to confirm the order, to again, get hung up on. After calling several times to recieve nothing but their voicemail, I tried calling from another phone, just to recieve their voicemail. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, that their having phone issues, that they received the order details and that it'd be ready in about 20-25 minutes. I get there, and they have a mask required sign in the window- which I respect. I put my mask on, and go inside just to see that absolutely no one is wearing a mask, let alone gloves for handling food. I ask for my order, and they say they never input the order because they couldn't confirm. They tried saying that they called me to try to confirm but got voicemail. However, I was by my phone(s) the entire time I was waiting. I called them on their lie and they were silent. Nevertheless, I ordered again and waited patiently. However, within that time I noticed that the place is filthy - every spot that the customer could see is clean, although when looking closer there is dust and insects in all the nooks and cranies. After receiving my food they said they were having technical difficulties and had to use the debit machine from the business next door. As long as I paid for what I received, I don't care.\n\nHOWEVER, I'm once again let down and disappointed from them when I get home. I asked for spicy butter chicken and it is the most bland butter chicken I've ever tasted. Lacking all seasoning and flavor. All I can taste is the yogurt. Their Naan is more like flat, tasteless, pancakes than actual Naan. Veggie pakora is also tasteless. Only flavor I taste is in the sauce.\n\nWon't be coming back. Highly disappointed.

The place I work for booked the function room. We have had our staff party/dinner at this location two years in a row - this was our third visit. Previous times were great, they cared. This time not so much. How standards have dropped! The plan was to have starter platters and then a selection of main courses with desserts. The starter platters were tiny and barely sufficient for the amount of people (literally half the size of the last few years). Most of us commented on how poorly they were presented and how little variety they contained - its almost like the kitchen had no idea on how to make or present starters. The main courses were below mediocre and the service was very slow (serving staff should ideally not smell of tobacco/weed) . No music was available (because the hockey game was on) - one would assume that they would have a separate music system in a function room.  When the meal was over, service vanished and then we were asked when we are leaving as they had other restaurant customers who wanted to use the room (seems as if the torn pool table was a key attraction). Not a great experience.

That's ridiculous considering they do take out only. The options on the machine were 15, 20 or 25 percent.\n\nFood was very tasty. The service was nice. The restaurant has been closed for dine-in since covid began. We called for takeout on New years Eve and there was only a 20-minute wait. They were out of some toppings and called back to ask if it was okay if they skipped it. Of course they didn't offer a discount for missing one topping. But they sure don't hesitate to charge if you add a topping.\n\nLasagna was very good. Lots of cheese. It came with garlic bread. The pizza was average. My husband got the barbecue chicken pizza. He loves getting barbecue sauce in place of pizza sauce. In this case you could barely taste the barbecue sauce. Also the bacon on this pizza was really gnarly and my husband spit it all out.\n\nI ordered pepperoni and bacon. I was disappointed that the pepperoni was like bologna sheets under the cheese. I prefer the Pizza Hut style with the crispy, greasy 1 inch diameter slices on top of the cheese not the fat 6 inch wide sheets of meat that look like bologna placed under the cheese. I guess it's just a personal preference.\n\nOddly enough the bacon on my pizza was delicious. You can really taste the smoky flavor. When we compared our slices you could tell the bacon on my pizza was completely different than the bacon on my husband's. Not sure what happened there. His was awful, gnarly and grayish in color. Mine was pink. Strange.\n\nI parked in front of the restaurant where they have street parking. It's usually hard to find a parking along the street.

Which most people will agree on.\nNow the comparison. There is a Panago Pizza at the Abbotsford Canucks hockey food court, which we have had several times. It has been good every time, right up there with my favorites. We have had the New York Deli and Hawaiian, both were cooked nicely and a good balance toppings. The Hawaiian has more than the standard load of cheese with a nice pull to it as you would expect. The Deli was good, period. They both had a nice chew with some exposed crust for you bread lovers, but not a jaw workout.\nSo.....we figure the local Panago must be the same, it is a franchise after all?! Simply put, the pizza was hard work to chew and the toppings were just not up to a standard I expect anywhere. Cooked a bit much on the bottom then gets doughy and tough as it progresses thru to the toppings. Should they not be able to replicate a franchise standard? I hope they can fix their issues, maybe I got a bad dough day......\nNo I won't be back and no I don't want anything."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sandra Vleeming"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIG1qVUP-bTaTnRkR2Vt1QZDJ6h0TXVO7kR_EJ_MKQQpgLLNg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""This has been the worst experience.

Apparently they clean their entire kitchen so it's safe for celiacs like me to eat their pierogies.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of seeing the post, I messaged the business by leaving a comment about how I wish I had known about them earlier because the cut off time had already passed to place a gluten-free order for the week. Within 2 hours, I received a response and they let me squeeze in an order because I live in Las Vegas, USA.\n\nTwo days later I flew up North and drove our rental car to pick up pierogies after sitting in Vancouver traffic. We made it 20 minutes before they closed and they had my frozen order waiting for me. I saw that they also sell a gluten-free pork sausage for $7 CAD (precooked I believe) and added that to my order.\n\nWe had a kitchen in our time share so I cooked up the sausage. It was very nice. I brought a cooler picnic basket with me through the airport full of ice. Because I have Celiac disease, I can bring food with me on planes. Security checked it and luckily, the pierogies are professionally packaged, labeled and sealed so I was able to bring them across the border.\n\nI believe we paid $16 CAD for 12 pierogies. We got 12 garlic lovers and 12 delux that are seasoned with feta and bacon in the mashed potato filling.\n\nThe instructions were clear and accurate. They were easy to cook once we got off the airplane.\n\nIf you're Celiac, preorder from them. I don't know of a single place in the States that even offers gluten-free pierogies, so this is likely your only chance!\n\nVisited: April 2024"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM6C08OqboGv0jjfCp_rby2YVTNEIA734rsUFln\u0026fid=0x0:0xe24f9eb92ae6477d""],""When"":""2024-4-22""},{""Name"":""Scott Perry"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXA62UgdjYO9FAc0ZgOmsWeN-u7IMpZi09R1jSwr4rklxDZlO9l=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Recently my wife and sisters ordered a large order that was being picked up by my sister from the Fraser Valley and driven to my home in E Van but part of the order was not grabbed as part of our total order that we were going to serve for a family reunion type of meal.\n\nVeronica's son, Logan, drove into E Van on a dark, rainy evening (in Canucks game traffic!) plus they added some treats and other products to the order!\n\nUnbelievable service - going the extra miles to keep customers happy (and it's fabulously yummy food)!\n\nWe're so grateful for this company!!

The last thing I want to do is write this complaint, but my experience at your drive-through about 45 minutes ago definitely warrants sharing.\n\nThe girl at the drive-through, wearing a brown sweatshirt and large glasses, was rude while we placed our order. My son had changed his mind mid-order, which seemed to confuse her. I thought she was adding a second meal rather than replacing the first one, so I tried to clarify by repeating everything. She abruptly snapped at me, almost yelling, \""I got it!\"" Her reaction took me by surprise, and even my son, who usually stays calm, was shocked.\n\nWhen we got to the window, I mentioned that I found her response rude. Instead of apologizing, she got defensive and agitated. When I asked for her name so I could speak to her supervisor later, she refused to give it and then slammed the window shut.\n\nI visit Aldergrove regularly, staying weeks at a time, and switched to McDonald’s for my coffee from the Tim Hortons across the street because of the incredibly delightful service I receive from Brian at the drive thru. I recognize that working the late shift is unpleasant and difficult, as I too have recently done graveyard shifts in a restaurant, however,. that is not a reason for attitude towards paying customers.  I genuinely think this young lady could benefit from some customer service training from someone like Brian.\n\nAs a Punjabi person with years in hospitality and service, it really frustrates me to see rude comments about us on social media.

The bacon is weaved together like a lattice and bites through clean. All on a softly but toasted brioche bun. 5 stars all day. The mushroom Swiss is top notch as well. Perfectly grilled mushrooms and real Swiss cheese on the same patti with crispy onions. Also 5 stars... By far the best burgers you can get in the Fraser valley/lower mainland area. I'm writing this review in my truck after just leaving their and I'm seriously contemplating going back inside to grab another one. I love that they are close to my place, but it's worth the drive if you don't live close. Just don't be late. Everything is fresh and I have come by at 2:00 and they were sold out of their burger patties. 5 stars all day. Riley makes an amazing burger."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

He started yelling at us the moment we tried to explain the situation. Every time we have gone there they don't charge for it and it's not available to add to the online order. The manager yelled over my husband and I as I tried to explain that we tried to order it online and it wouldn't allow us and he says alot of things aren't available online! Stop asking for free food! Upon opening our family meal, come to find out 4 crispy chicken tenders didn't make it in our bag. Call back and all they can do is make 4 tenders if we come back. No real resolution as we live 30 minutes away. They denied not giving us the chicken tenders but say they will make them for us if we come back just because they don't want to argue. They don't believe their customers and they don't value our business. They are the dishonest ones who accuse us of trying to ask for free food.\n\nWon't go back to this location. Disturbed by their service, or lack their of.\n\nI made a complaint a few days ago and still haven't heard back from them. This is why Popeyes chicken is WAY better. You actually get what you pay for and the chicken is way better there. And check this, when you ask Popeyes for a side of spicy mayo, they give you it!  No questions asked! because like the rest of us they realize it isnt coming out of their pay check and its not food its a condiment! If it was on the menu we would have no problem paying for it but they decide to charge however much for it when they so chose. Also, Way bigger pieces of chicken and way crispier yummier fries at Popeyes. Save your money. This place will scam you and leave you with a headache.\n\nI tried to give this location another chance after they double charged me and didn't refund me for 3 months, now this.

Starting off looking at the back of all the people sitting at the bar that are all wearing Merchant aprons, then the young person serving our table, well she didn't take into the fact that we just sat down, and she was dismissive, bordering in impatient.

There was no cleaning staff at 6pm, so I actually had the front desk give me their mop, and I cleaned the entire room myself when I got there because they had no other room available. There was very clearly fecal matter on the wall under the toilet paper holder, so I went to the grocery story conveniently across the street for some bleach, and I spent a couple hours washing everything I could before I felt comfortable enough to sleep there. I told the front staff, but she said she's new. I asked her to tell the manager. I'll edit this post if I ever hear back, photos were sent from my contact info, as well as the complaint, so you know how to reach me. I submitted pictures to the staff at front desk already via email, but I have more. I tried 3 times to talk to someone about this, with no luck, so you get a review now.\n\nOf note, the ground floor rooms have windows that can open, overlooking a very sketchy gravel path behind the building. If you're uncomfortable with that, like I was, be aware."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jake"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJYNTn42uhzKgc1iwTMYa-IKKV-A_0UKLwpYNWzz8LHzh1rYw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""I stay at a lot of Best Westerns to travel for work and this has been the first one I have had issues with.

It is with great disappointment that I express my complete lack of recommendation for this establishment. From unhygienic practices to disrespectful treatment, my visit left a lasting negative impression.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I observed three customers waiting for their meals at a table. As I stood at the bar, waiting to pay and receive my order totaling $110, I was approached by an older lady. In a hushed voice, she whispered, \""I wouldn't eat here. Look how disgusting that is!\"" She pointed to the owner, who was using a mop to wipe down the fan above the grill, with food still cooking directly below it. This unhygienic act raised serious concerns about the potential for cross-contamination.\n\nIn light of what I had witnessed, I politely approached a waiter and expressed my apprehension about paying for the food. As expected, he laughed at me and directed me to speak with the owner, who was conveniently seated nearby, eavesdropping on our conversation. To my utter dismay, the owner greeted me with a smirk and callously stated, \""That's just how we clean here,\"" as if my concerns were unwarranted. His mocking attitude made me feel unheard and invalidated.\n\nAttempting to explain the gravity of the situation, I emphasized that I have two children who depend on me for their meals. I expressed my deep discomfort in feeding them food that had been handled in such an unsanitary manner. However, the owner continued to dismiss my concerns and laugh in my face, showing a complete lack of empathy.\n\nFaced with such disrespectful treatment, I made the decision to leave the restaurant immediately. It is crucial to shed light on the unhygienic practices I witnessed at Zythos Mediterranean Grill. Cleaning the fan above the grill while there is raw food actively cooking below it is a clear violation of basic food safety and sanitation standards. This lack of regard for hygiene puts customers at risk of consuming contaminated food, which can lead to serious health issues.\n\nMoreover, I must highlight the unsettling reactions I encountered during my visit. Before entering the restaurant to address my concerns about payment, I had a conversation with another customer named Mariam. She claimed to be a frequent customer who knows the owner personally. I shared the video footage I had captured and explained the situation to her. Surprisingly, Mariam initially downplayed the issue, assuring me that the establishment is clean and that I should proceed to pick up my food. She even advised me to delete the video and refrain from posting it online, citing potential negative consequences for the business.\n\nIt is important to note that the waiter and the owner seemed to be aware of my intentions before I even approached them. This suggests that Mariam may have informed them about our conversation, further adding to the distrust and lack of transparency that I experienced as a paying customer.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to Zythos Mediterranean Grill was marred by unhygienic practices, disrespectful treatment, and unsettling reactions. It is my firm belief that the uncleanliness of the establishment and the disregard for customer concerns should never be tolerated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this restaurant to anyone, as the health and well-being of customers should always be the top priority."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNPjywBrLfYA-NnAv623KQt9w4PRPvRWwG1LOvZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x82bf87a3db20203d""],""When"":""2024-6-30""},{""Name"":""Ralph Wyatt"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUN28UZv5zBQyNqkHdh4edz4iBwoslU-5vQSp6k9ZPs8OvdAN6z=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had a gathering of 25 people in the group room.

This is important when considering Golden Medal.  This is not authentic and refined Chinese.  Rather, it is westernized Chinese food that is common across Canada and they do it well.\n\nThe decor here is in need of a refresh.  There is visible wear and tear.  Maintenance and updating have been put off, likely the fault of the previous Chinese restaurant that occupied this space.  Even the outside signage is in desperate need of replacement.  Things are clean though and there is obviously an effort to present the best face of the old space.  It is not overly distracting and should not deter you from considering a dine-in experience.\n\nService here is very friendly and efficient.  Tea was recommended to us due to the wet and cold weather outside, this was a thoughtful gesture.  Our order was taken without any delay.  There was some dialogue to find out our interests and ensure we were satisfied.  It met our needs in a very helpful and personal way.\n\nThe food we had was fresh and well done.  I was surprised at some delicate flavor profiles that are not often found in this style of food.  Vegetables were cooked but also remained crisp.  The almond chicken was nicely battered and the nuts were fresh.  Portion size was large and we walked out with leftover containers.\n\nIs this a good choice for a meal that is large enough for most appetites.

The food came out in a timely manner and the quality and proportions is worth the price set. However, sometimes the food can be a bit too salty. The bathroom is clean and well kept. The only issue is the stall in the men's washroom is dimly lit, due to a wall blocking a light from reaching the stall.

Pro tip: bring your appetite (and maybe stretchy pants)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNFSgY7Qw0TI4_FF_Knyw5QWoOn1h6jOF3B4Ipd\u0026fid=0x0:0x7549bf650c090cbe""],""When"":""2024-12-19""},{""Name"":""Bala888"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKwpXKXLnWVbmRWE49mxf-yYsdsA4jpYsnTuSzc7_Jf6iiW=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""First time here everything looks good on menu.

last Saturday at noon to celebrate my niece's 10th birthday. Unfortunately it was anything but a celebration.\n\nWe were told the restaurant was heavily understaffed. However when we arrived the area was quite empty. There were 6 people in our party and we ordered drinks and a couple of platters to start. We were not offered water or given any cutlery. We asked for plates twice as we were sharing and were told they didn't have enough plates, so were washing the used ones.  We never got the plates, and as seen, we resorted to using napkins as plates. No one checked up on us during the visit, and once we gave feedback on our poor experience, our server became very hostile. We had the supervisor come over who was very responsive and said that he would bring this up with the manager who is in later that evening and would be contacting me. We never heard back from them. Also, we were overcharged on our drinks. Safe to say that we will never be returning to this establishment nor recommending to our friends and family."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN5-0AnnBmbjwDoheeg4U90W9FmZ7A4OLgQLI41\u0026fid=0x0:0x3db86c98b54ebcd5""],""When"":""2023-8-22""},{""Name"":""Steve"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJVzye2bejZi9is8vCHJK2PG4wfBMpqZvIa7DUB9fY1EmXEow=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""The food is good and the weekend brunch is the best deal in town.

Aren’t nachos supposed to have cheese?\n\nWe were sat for 43 mins before the food came out to us. I asked for plates as soon as the food came out and the server told us “it was in the dishwasher”. Not sure how long their dishwasher loads take, but they might want to consider switching up for a faster one, or buying more plates. We ended up eating on napkins. Not once were we checked on. There was no water served or plates given to us during our entire meal. The table next to us ended up cleaning their own table (pic below) because of the lack of service.\n\nWhen brought to the attention of the server, she decided to get argumentative about it and make excuses. We asked for the manager, but no manager on-site (convenient). Spoke to a shift supervisor who continued to make excuses (as follows) for the horrible service and provide us with almost expiring coupons. Excuse #1: “you came during our busiest brunch hour” (the picture below shows how empty it was)\nExcuse #2: “We always wait for the customer to ask us for water and then bring it to the table”\nExcuse #3: “We’re human too” and on he went…\n\nThe one and ONLY restaurant I’ve been to where the word “sorry” is as scarce as the people at its busiest hour.

The portions are generous, and the quality of the meat is outstanding. Whether you’re dining in or taking out, the food is consistently fresh and perfectly cooked.\nIf you’re a fan of barbecue, Texas Smoke BBQ is a must-try spot in Vancouver. The friendly service and cozy atmosphere add to the overall experience, making it an ideal destination for both casual meals and special occasions.

This place is a vibe, man! I sampled the Brisket on a bun as well as the JT Sando. There was plenty of thick cut brisket topped with a chilli pepper aioli providing just the right amount of heat. The JT Sando had pulled pork with sliced pork sausage on a bun with a light topping of BBQ sauce. Hard to say which sandwich I preferred. The JT had a little bit more smoke present, but the texture of the brisket coupled with a kiss of heat is hard to beat. Just order both. You won’t be disappointed.

Willowbrook Dr, Langley, BC V2Y 1A7\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were promptly greeted by the hostess, who exuded warmth and professionalism. We were seated immediately, setting a positive tone for the rest of our dining experience.\n\nFood:\n\nAs a starter, we were served a small plate of salad accompanied by miso soup. While the salad was decent, without any standout qualities, the miso soup was flavorful and well-prepared, providing a comforting beginning to our meal.\n\nAppetizer:\n\nEbi Chili Mayo\nDeep-fried king-size tiger prawns served with a special chili mayo, topped with corn chips.\n\nThe Ebi Chili Mayo appetizer was particularly impressive. The crispiness of the prawns, combined with the rich and tangy chili mayo, created a harmonious balance of texture and flavor. The prawns were generously sized and cooked to perfection. This dish is highly recommended for those seeking a flavorful and satisfying appetizer.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nFor the main course, we opted for The Ultimate Dinner, which featured a giant lobster tail, filet mignon steak, shrimp, and scallops.\n\nThe portion of rice served initially was generous, a notable difference from other establishments. The filet mignon steak was undoubtedly the highlight of the meal—cooked to a perfect rare as requested, it was tender, well-seasoned, and delectable. The scallops were also commendable, with a beautiful golden-brown sear and a delicate taste. The shrimp and lobster were equally well-prepared, with a good balance of seasoning that enhanced their natural flavors. The accompanying vegetables were fresh and well-cooked, rounding out the dish nicely.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nChef:\n\nOur teppanyaki chef was exceptionally friendly and engaging, adding a personal touch to the meal. While the performance followed the typical teppanyaki format, he did manage to surprise us with an unexpected trick, which was a pleasant addition to the experience. Overall, his skill and demeanor contributed positively to the meal.\n\nService:\n\nThe service throughout our visit was outstanding. Our waitress was attentive, courteous, and ensured that our needs were met promptly. Her professionalism and friendliness greatly enhanced our dining experience.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nAmbiance:\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant, while generally acceptable, would benefit from some modernization and upgrades. While it was adequate for the meal, it lacked the refinement one might expect from a venue of this caliber.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nPrice:\nThe pricing was reasonable, given the high quality of ingredients and the entertainment value provided by the teppanyaki chef. The combination of visual spectacle and culinary expertise justifies the cost, making it a worthwhile experience.\n\nVerdict:\n\nDespite the need for some improvements in ambiance, Katana excels in delivering high-quality food and exceptional service. The overall dining experience was enjoyable, and I look forward to returning in the future. This restaurant is certainly worth a visit for those seeking a memorable teppanyaki experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOaM4OKd2KhyPNz7exU4L9Q8RpXhfY6SIvjOzwm\u0026fid=0x0:0x858be81c5fe06f32""],""When"":""2024-8-28""},{""Name"":""Anita McNicol"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK0JW5CHjmARyzVTPTZ-TkzzAfoHjlwQrVWvIpZxMySK5mX5w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Wonderful experience.

Sarah went above and beyond to make our night out truly enjoyable.\n\nShe also kept our drinks refilled throughout the meal, which we really appreciated.\n\nThe quality of the lobster was excellent, the steak was top-notch once corrected, and everything tasted wonderful.\n\nWe’ll definitely be back, knowing Montana's values their customers and takes pride in providing a great dining experience!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM1ZLOzQn2A2tqrHLvClndJuGA0GfuUdXou3B3h\u0026fid=0x0:0xe8b6de88ec3a90d2""],""When"":""2024-11-30""},{""Name"":""Metellingtruth"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX2Ixwi5jN-cdh2Vu-fk-hv_6VlCc2I9AVnxQXyHSyTUw_H5WWv=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""One of the last places left in Canada with big meaty dishes.
