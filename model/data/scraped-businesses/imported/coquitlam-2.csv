The Bulgogi eggs benedict was a hearty recommendation that hit the mark, though I might pair it with a side salad next time to balance things out.\nThe Americano was a bit watery for my taste, as I prefer a richer, more rounded brew, but the coffee they use is good, as evidenced by the delicious Affogato.

Having been to South Korea many times in my life the service and fusion flavours are truly unique but give me hints of neat spots I tried on my travels but with a more North American twist. Will definitely keep coming back and continue to spread the word about this fantastic hidden gem.\n\nThey have ample parking, cute indoor diner style seating and a nice patio for sunny days outside.

I ordered their duck fettuccine, and chocolate peanut butter cheesecake both were a 10/10.  I have tried a lot of pasta at many different restaurants (including upscale) and this place was significantly better.  It reminded me of the pasta I ate when in Rome and Florence.\n\nI am a desert person and am very critical of desserts. The chocolate peanut butter cheese cake was airy and the best dessert I had in a long time. It was not dense as your typical cheese cake dessert.\n\nThe pasta I ate was very well priced. The wine was well priced and dessert.  The excellent quality and taste for the food for the price is unheard of these days.\n\nThe customer service was amazing. I believe it was the owners. They were funny and kind and made the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience. This will be my go-to pasta place. Only “negative”  is that this place is 30 minutes from my home. The food I ate was so delicious that I purchased take out for the same order (pasta and dessert) so that I could eat it the next day without driving back….I’ve never done that before.\n\nEdit: the takeout was not as good for some reason.

The beef skewers were kind of on the skinnier side, but were definitely not dry and the peanut sauce was amazing. The crispy pork belly was probably what shined the most. I’m not a huge pork belly fan but this pork belly was not too fatty, extremely moist and tasty.

The thin, crispy crust paired beautifully with its rich toppings, striking the perfect balance between flavor and texture. It was clear that great care and quality ingredients went into every bite.\n\nThe Funghi Pasta was equally outstanding. The earthy richness of the mushrooms combined with a creamy sauce created a dish that was both comforting and indulgent. The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the flavors were well-balanced, making it one of the best pasta dishes we’ve had in a long time.\n\nThe Golden Boot offers more than just great food; it provides an inviting and cozy atmosphere that enhances the dining experience. The staff were warm, attentive, and knowledgeable, making our evening even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fresh and authentic Italian experience in Coquitlam, The Golden Boot is a gem worth discovering. We can’t wait to return and explore more of their menu!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBr1HapyFm5MQNZ6xipl9yNR8QHro3gqqHsWMA\u0026fid=0x0:0xec9b84a60327fe07""],""When"":""2024-12-11""},{""Name"":""Jamie K"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLbJ2U1LY4qMlQOmrUVddM2YAaHlcLuD0VLF8l26mbYtDI6YXU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Food was good especially pizza was delicious.

Each fry was a little piece of heaven, perfectly seasoned and dangerously addictive.\n\nThen came the seafood risotto, and let me tell you, it was nothing short of perfection. Each grain of rice was tender, infused with a rich, oceanic symphony of flavors. The seafood? Plump, fresh, and cooked to absolute perfection—like it had been caught that very morning. Every bite was a revelation, a crescendo of tastes that danced on my palate.\n\nAnd then came the pièce de résistance: the blueberry cheesecake. If angels bake, this is what their desserts taste like. The cheesecake was impossibly creamy, with a luscious texture that felt like silk on my tongue. The blueberries, bursting with freshness, added a vibrant sweetness that complemented the tangy richness of the cake. It wasn’t just a dessert—it was a masterpiece.\n\nI can’t recommend this restaurant enough. Every dish was a love letter to flavor, every bite a testament to culinary brilliance.

the best KBBQ in Coquitlam at Galbi!

While the space is a bit cozy, the meal was absolutely fantastic. The marinated beef short ribs were so irresistible that we ended up ordering extra.\n\nWe were expecting the bill to be around $200, but were pleasantly surprised when it came out $60 cheaper—even with the tip included.

Enjoyed the salad and sides, but they charge for extra side dishes and restrict you to 3 pieces of romaine lettuce per meat order (which seems a bit stingy for a small side item). There was also dirt on the lettuce, which they washed off and returned to us...

great surprise as I have not been to a Browns in years and I had previously been very disappointed with their prices and menu. However, after stopping at Cactus Club and seeing their selections and prices ($42 for a bottle of house wine!!!! that was not really very good at all), my bestie and I grabbed our coats and drove 4 min farther to Browns Social House.  We were  looking for a hostess to see if we were to seat ourselves when this pleasant young man with a huge friendly smile came up and asked if we needed help.  (I assumed he was a server.) He said we could sit where we wanted and we  chose a nice corner table and sat down. We laughed and told the waitress about our day. (Another whole story). Needless to say, the wine was very good and reasonably priced, the food was tasty and served quickly and the young man who had seated us came over and was actually the manager!   Our server had told him of our ridiculous day and he actually came and talked to us and thoroughly added positivity to our evening of a very long and crazy day. Carter is excellent at his job and our server said they all think he's just the best. So I stand corrected on my previous thoughts of Browns.  Carter and his staff changed my mind completely and instead of going to Cactus Club I will most definitely stop here instead. And currently, their Happy hour menu has changed and is now half price wine from 3-5 every day!  We will try that next time for sure!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Janice Chau"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJVuB0K-5M1meSEpaNhkSCxzMPwN-1TgA7zbcO9oRfCt3rzUnQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I liked the ambiance.

I opted to dine in after the thorough explanation and genuine service even before I sat. Once I settled on an order the staff loudly shouted to the kitchen staff and proceeded to hand me utensils/water. Moments later I could hear a meat mallet being slammed against what can be presumed to be my order (pork loin cutlet). Not long after I sat down another customer came in asking to look at the menu and explaining they're unfamiliar with the concept. the food came out quickly. The deep fried loin was pleasantly plated; light tasting; and juicy with flavour. 5/5 food. 5/5 service. 5/5 ambiance. Seems like cabbage salad sides are unlimited too! Beginning to end this was 5/5.

We ended up getting the Tebboki or however you say it, some honey butter chicken, some fried squid, as well as the kimchi.\n\nThe chicken gave me a mouth orgasm, although, this could have been because I was rather inebriated on various cannabis products. However, I blinked and the food was gone. My spice tolerance is also decently high, so beware people that are not used to spicy food the tebboki might be a bit much. However, the rice offset the spicy flavour and made the meal a very good combo to eat together.\n\n5/5 would recommend to people.

I have also been to their new location on Kingsway. We have tried many different dishes from their House special pho, spicy beef pho, house special with saté broth, their rice dishes, vermicelli dishes, chicken wings, salad rolls, and their bahn mi. We have brought our friends and family several times to eat at Pho Superbowl because we loved their food and generous portions.\n\nToday, I ordered #66 grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli which I have had plenty of times before, but for some reason, the grilled pork tasted sour and off, like the meat had already gone bad. I waved down one of the servers to let them know and she was nice enough to offer to change it to a different meat. I picked out all of the spoiled meat into a small bowl which she took back to the kitchen. Then, I heard the head cook angrily yell in the background. Shortly after, a different lady came back with the same bowl with the spoiled pork and said they can't give me a new one because \""I already ate it\"". What do you mean I already ate it? It wasn't like I finished all the food and asked for a new bowl for free! I just took out all of the spoiled pork out of my vermicelli bowl and planned to eat the rest of the food!\n\nI am beyond disappointed especially since we loved coming to eat here and we were always generous with tipping.... but we are not coming back. I understand that restaurants can sometimes have a one-off, and I am usually willing to give another chance. However, since they did not want to fix the issue after I brought it up (especially regarding food safety like spoiled food), Pho Superbowl doesn't deserve another chance."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOmdrUm8xnjIm9gt1H0Nz5JcPG-4epoJmnZ1RFQ\u0026fid=0x0:0x55e781ca19889a62""],""When"":""2024-4-28""}]",

Despite the restaurant not being very busy, our server seemed disinterested and hardly checked on us. We had to flag them down multiple times just to get basic things like water refills.\n\nThe food, which I was looking forward to the most, was underwhelming. The pierogi were bland, lacking any real flavor or seasoning, and the filling was far too dry. The borscht was greasy and tasted more like something that had been reheated multiple times rather than freshly made. It was also way too salty, which made it hard to finish.\n\nThe manager/owner, when I raised my concerns, was dismissive and unhelpful. Rather than apologizing or offering a solution, they seemed indifferent to our experience. It’s always frustrating when management doesn’t take feedback seriously, and it only made the situation worse. It felt like they weren’t interested in improving their service or maintaining customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I won’t be returning.

The restaurant offers a traditional North American Japanese menu with no fusion or modernized dishes, nor any super high-end options. However, the craftsmanship of the food, its presentation, and the exceptionally friendly atmosphere make Nagano Japanese stand out.\n\nOur meal consisted of several small dishes that we shared, all of which were expertly prepared with fresh ingredients. The raw seafood, including uni, salmon, toro, fish roes, and tuna, was especially delicious and fresh. But it was the cooked dishes that really impressed us. The fried softshell crab had a thin, crispy batter, yet the crab itself was still tender and juicy. The fried salmon cheeks were also fantastic, with succulent, tender meat clinging to the jaw bones. And the grilled mackerel was cooked to perfection, with crispy, thin skin that was perfectly browned and charred.\n\nHowever, what really made the dining experience memorable was the friendly hospitality of the owner or manager, Susie. She was patient, accommodating, and genuinely made us feel welcome. She made everything great with her personal touches on customer interactions.\n\nIt's unfortunate that there have been several negative reviews lately, perhaps due to a shortage of qualified staff or an increase in takeout orders. Nonetheless, some of the best dishes we had could only be appreciated when freshly cooked and served straight from the kitchen."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOgmliG0wkzCCsfYn85x-UYasSgQBkHZy1LkHwG\u0026fid=0x0:0x7f9ed62ea165733f""],""When"":""2023-3-19""},{""Name"":""Mina A"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUa3Ot95qqtO1ooc2Pz-iCEqTxvgYh82KnLf13it1wz8uNx1lvA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""This was the second time we ate here. First time was in 2018 or 2019. My partner didn’t want to come back because he insisted the food wasn’t great the last time we were here. I convinced him that every place deserves a second chance, especially after so long! Upon arrival, we were told to seat anywhere we wanted outside as we wanted to be out on the patio. We chose a table far from the other couple that were already eating on the patio (this table wasn’t quite clean and was a bit slanted). A few minutes later the server came with the menus and moved us to another table that was “level”. But this table was not clean either and there were no chairs, so I had to grab my own chair to help the server out. She wiped down the table after we were seated, so 2 dirty tables even though the restaurant was not that busy. There was a sour smell in the patio the moment we sat down (my partner thought it could be dog pee?). No soap in the men’s washroom. Strong urine smell in the women’s bathroom. We ordered 4 items. The crispy shrimp appetizer with salad and sweet chilli sauce was delicious but would have been better if the sauce was served on the side in case someone doesn’t love the dressing. Gomae wasn’t crisp/fresh. Considering the higher prices on the menu compared to other Japanese restaurants in the city, we had higher expectations. For the mains, we got the sizzling scallop and the black cod. The dishes didn’t arrive together. The sizzling scallops were not really “sizzling”. There were 2 scallops with some mushrooms and vermicelli on a shell over a candle. It tasted good but the portion was small and it wasn’t that special for me to want to try it again. The black cod was charred in some areas and the portion was also small for the price, didn’t come with any sides either but at least it tasted good. The sever never came to check on our food or if we needed anything else, only came once to refill the water/tea, and once more, about 5 minutes after we had finished our food to clean the table and bring the bill. She was very nice though. If I only were to rate the food, considering that it was not exceptional and it was pricy, I would conclude that it’s a 4/5. But considering everything else, I have to deduct a point (I wish I could deduct half points, in which case I would have rated it 3.5/5, but because google maps only does full points, and I just can’t see this place as a 4, then it gets a 3/5). Overall, we are still not impressed , maybe even disappointed a little, and will not be returning. Thank you for having us though."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNHe6tz4z7F8SQgqo6zMn7pmnL65n6Rp0VzItOq\u0026fid=0x0:0x7f9ed62ea165733f""],""When"":""2023-5-21""}]",

tonight from Dinakis (through skip the dishes).

The restaurant was immediately called to inform them. They stated that we needed to contact skip for a refund (which is fine!) and said the chicken was raw due to how busy the restaurant was tonight. Unfortunately, I do not see this as a valid reason for serving undercooked meat. They offered to remake the meal and have me come and pick it up.

They could have used a few more servers on a busy Saturday night, but the staff were very friendly and immediately responsive whenever we asked.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, including the seafood hot pot, fishcake soup and fried fish. Amazing flavours and textures, with generous portions that are ample for sharing! The fried items were light \u0026 crispy. The steaming umami soups had just the right amount of spicy kick. You won't find traditional bibimbap, japchae or pancakes because their menu heavily features innovative takes on fresh seafood - not for those with shellfish allergies! Plenty of Korean spirits to test out \u0026 quench your thirst! At first glance the prices seem high but considering that the plates can be shared, the restaurant offers great value.

A female server welcomed me, and she was very friendly.\n\nI ordered the combo with Jajangmyeon (black bean noodles), Jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup), and Tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork). About 10 minutes later, all three dishes arrived together. The Tangsuyuk seemed to be fried in clean oil, and both the meat and the batter were exceptional. (Having worked in the restaurant industry, I could tell the frying oil was fresh.)\n\nThe Jajangmyeon and Jjamppong were delicious too, but the Tangsuyuk was the highlight.\n\nThe portions were generous, with all the food being flavorful and filling.\n\nThere were a couple of minor downsides:\n\n1.\tAfter the food was served, although the restaurant wasn’t busy, no one came by to check on the food or refill the side dishes. But with food this tasty, it was easy to overlook.\n2.\tThey were playing a Charlie Puth medley, which didn’t quite match the restaurant’s vibe.

That said, once you acquire the taste, it becomes incredibly addictive.\n\nTheir spicy stir-fried gopchang (intestines) is another standout dish, offering just the right kick of heat. Pair your meal with traditional Korean makgeolli (rice wine) for an authentic dining experience.

This was $6 during happy hour!!\n\nI decided to have the chole Bhature, the chole (chickpeas) was very flavourful. Not overly spicy at all as I requested mild. It came with yogurt, pickled carrots, and some veggies. Overall I’d give it an 8/10, it definitely satisfied the craving.

Overall,  a great restaurant to hang out at with friends and it’s opened until midnight."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOAk-bHbstZU-CJdI-wvoyKXTIC0WcdxcUcZTIf\u0026fid=0x0:0x666f1ced9bf985e9""],""When"":""2024-9-3""},{""Name"":""C.K.

In the end, decided on this place since it’s been decade or longer since I have been to this place.\n\nUpon entering, it seems like the interior went through a bit of change and renovation. The place was pretty empty except for 3 booths seated with customers, maybe it was near closing time (1.5hrs before closing). Everything appeared to be clean throughout the restaurant with a comfortable spacing between the tables and booths.\n\nThe service was subpar from the server, maybe she was more focused on cleaning and getting off work. When the owner/ manager took over, it was a lot better and she was more polite.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Sizzling Hot plate combo B+B (chicken steak \u0026 sausages) with borscht soup, spaghetti , cold lemon tea. The chicken was a little dry and the soup was a bit off and warm only. And the hot plate didn’t sizzle at all, maybe a 3 second frisk sound?\n2. Sizzling hot place combo A+B (filet mignon \u0026 deep fried oysters) with lobster bisque, steamed rice, add lobster tail $23 extra. The filet mignon was horrible, first time ever struggling to chew a filet mignon, it was dry and didn’t taste fresh. The oysters were little midgets. The steamed rice was more like overnight rice just added a bit of water and a quick heat up by the microwave, it was dry and hard. And lastly the lobster tail was horrible; it had that bad fishy taste to it, one tiny bite from that and had to stop cause not worth food poisoning myself from it. And once again the sizzling plate wasn’t even warm!! (Facepalm) The only thing okay was the lobster bisque.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed with the food. I don’t remember it being this bad? What happened? Closer to closing time and whoever the cook in the kitchen was didn’t give 2 cents about the food being served? Is it really that hard to hire a decent cook nowadays after the pandemic? And for crying out loud, it only takes 30 seconds to heat up the iron plates and how can one pawn off such a bad bowl of rice in a Chinese restaurant? I honestly would send this cook packing for retirement if working for me, definitely wouldn’t tolerate this kind of bs jeopardizing my business.\n\nI guess I retained my good nature and composure by taking into consideration that the owner/manager was very polite and friendly; very poise and elegant with the services. I guess that’s the only good part of this experience and kept my positivity inlined. Just enjoyed a quick instant noodle when back home lol"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMMcEYpyZUuanHEcQL55fa0WprgsuAX0S3V4h87\u0026fid=0x0:0xa9d123f17cb34070""],""When"":""2024-1-25""},{""Name"":""Chang Wun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXinnRETbtdmwq0G3dzHpocXq4c0y1kT8tCLTmXT5-MPrsCx3WH9g=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went back for the breakfast.

If you become a member, which costs $15 per year, you can enjoy a 10% discount on all orders, which is a great deal.\n\nOne of the highlights of Copa Cafe is their breakfast menu, which boasts generous portions that won't hurt your wallet despite the current high prices. On my recent visit, I opted for the satay beef noodle and shared the cheese, spinach, and bacon omelette with my husband. We also ordered two cups of their famous Hong Kong-style milk tea. After applying the 10% membership discount, our bill was a reasonable $23 with the tip included.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with both the quality and quantity of our breakfast. The flavors were satisfactory, and the portions were generous. Copa Cafe is a must-visit spot for anyone who loves Hong Kong-style cuisine and wants to try something new. The ambiance is cozy, and the service is top-notch, making it an ideal spot for a date or a casual gathering with friends."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNSzLi3djIKGAYOhylqv9qdoGJbTHEE6Sfx7hU\u0026fid=0x0:0xa9d123f17cb34070""],""When"":""2023-6-17""}]",

Glad to see it's still here and I'm visiting again after 20+ years. All I remember was that I liked their hot and sour soup.\n\nNot really an authentic Szechuan restaurant. 30 years ago, most chinese cuisines were cooked by hong kongers or south chinese people. So, most of these dishes are going to be a southern take on it.\n\nHot and sour soup - price is awesome. $11 enough for at least 6 bowls. Souo base is missing a bit of flavor but it is jam packed with ingredients.\n\nDrunken chicken - it was ok. Little on the salty side.\n\nShanghainese pan fried pork buns - these were probably the worst I've had. Not made in house and not properly pan fried. No juice, super dry, no fried bottom crust.\n\nBean curd wrapped pork dim sum - surprisingly this came out last. At least 20 min has passed. This is a steamed dish but it came out with dried edges like it was sitting on a dry heater. Taste was ok.\n\nMapo tofu - asked for extra spicy and extra numbing. Numbing was there but nowhere near real szechuan numbing. Was not spicy at all. Sauce was more oily than saucey.\n\nThe price point reflects the quality. Things are either mediocre or a complete miss. Would come again to try only the better stuff. Staff was friendly. Came to try to refill the tea way more times than normal. The iron goddess tea tastes much better than a lot of dim sum places elsewhere."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOsyXtmZVjFTpSM7j5XHpsMqasJjiN51hrkn9sk\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c85358e6c767e95""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""Sarah Grace"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX0P_FT3n0HZdmLMDEJ6UcRFNPyHbE7QJ8GW3gOL-SGGTFh-sFdQw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good Chinese food, some of the best we’ve tried!

It’s kind of a smaller place and pretty basic to me.\n\nAnyways, here were the dim sum I ordered;\n\n1. Seafood dumpling in soup. The imitation crab being used made the broth a bit overly sweet, was too unpleasant to finish it.\n2. Steamed spicy beef tripe. It wasn’t tender enough, needed to steam it a bit longer.\n3. Steamed chicken feet with special sauce. It wasn’t tender enough for the skin to fall off the bone, needed to run through the deep fryer a bit longer during the prep process.\n4. Turnip cake with XO sauce. It’s almost a joke, my 10 year old nephew could’ve done better with this dish especially its presentation. Failed!\n5. Baked preserved egg and ginger pastry. Absolutely horrible, the preserved egg was rubbery and the whole pastry crumbled along with its ginger paste. Failed!\n6. Fried vegetables with shrimp paste. An alternate version of the deep fried eggplant with shrimp paste. It was so so.\n7. Baked bbq pork buns. It was okay, the bbq pork could be less sweet.\n8. Purple rice roll with fish paste. It was okay, the super jumbo size was unexpected.\n9. Stir fry udon with live lobster. Surprisingly it was pretty good, enough wok hay to really bring out the flavours.\n10. Little white rabbit pudding. Not bad, cute little treats.\n\nOverall, I wasn’t too impressed with the layout and atmosphere of the restaurant. It portray itself as a mid class Chinese seafood restaurant, but felt l like a simple family restaurant with mid level prices.\n\nThe service was okay, enough to satisfy the basics, don’t expect anything more than that.\n\nAs for the food, honestly it was probably one of the most disappointing experience I had so far out of all the Neptunes I’ve been to.\n\nNot a repeat or recommendation from me anytime soon… 1.5 stars"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQR35TFh2sABn6mWQv4-F7inIjdWxHkqeXqX1w\u0026fid=0x0:0xe8960ddf73ad1704""],""When"":""2024-6-3""},{""Name"":""Danny Y"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8eoyUE6az-FmQo7i2mVq5z64Ow48sgKu1EmLZc0zWWN6DMy5asw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Came for dimsum.

We ventured into the realm of rolls, bravely ordering a spider roll among others. But alas, as if taking cues from a magician, the sushi rice decided to fall apart before our very eyes. The roll itself seemed to have had an identity crisis, comprising 10% crab, 70% cucumber, and a surprising twist of 20% lettuce. Had I known, I would have simply strolled to Save On, snagged a head of lettuce and a cucumber, and called it a night.\n\nThe adventure continued as we discovered that ordering anything with cucumber in this establishment is akin to inviting a vegetable tsunami onto your plate. On the bright side, it's an involuntary dive into your daily greens. Our server, possibly mistaking us for sprinters, could hardly wait for us to finish verbalizing our order before she was off again.\n\nFor those seeking real sushi over rabbit food, I'd point you towards Shio Sushi.

I used to love Hons cause they used to have Good portions and amazing flavour for a good price however, things have turned for the worse recently and now even the cheaper TNT meals you can get at the mall tastes better than the food on this day.\n\nThe wonton soup was super salty and tasted very fishy which i’ve never experienced in a wonton soup before (i love wonton soup so that was surprising that it tasted so wierd). I also ordered the beef and brocoli crispy Chow Mein, which is no longer on their menu but the lady said they could make it which is why I gave them a high rating for the service. The chow mein (the whole thing including the beef) tasted a bit wrong like if it shouldn’t be eaten. Not sure how to describe the flavour but it just tasted off and wrong to eat. It was not the flavour I had known and loved hons for, instead it tasted wierd. I am incredibly disappointed that one of my previous favourite chinese food spots no longer have good flavour and have gone downhill. We did order other things as well and honestly the only thing i liked from this whole meal is the rice.\n\nI will be on the search for better chinese food restaurants because i’m so sad and disappointed that this one won’t hold up to a good standard anymore. The service was really good however and they were very quick, efficient and kind so good job on the service. It was the food that was a big turn off. I hope they are able to bring back their old good flavour they used to have in their food and improve on the quality and flavour."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOeS2mABL7p7eLR9gTvg-74i-iEn4ZW4T_qAG3o\u0026fid=0x0:0x95ff28cd48bec56f""],""When"":""2024-9-13""},{""Name"":""Nona SM"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIfjTMq2ZKlGJ4Ldu_6g6I_gZ33bv-9-UjHyDYxTjehH_EmHBBS=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We would rate this restaurant 0 star if we could, The portions are big, but the smell of the food is horrendous so you will not even get to eat the food.

The only silver lining is that there were 3 slices that were okay, but it’s appalling that these slices were even considered for consumption. I’m all for saving leftovers and food, but this was so disappointing.\n\nUPDATE: I don’t think you guys understand my issue.

It's more modern and cozy looking. By the slice, costs about ~$4 /slice or so. If you just want a few slices to eat there, they would warm up the ones on the display for you. I think because they've been sitting on the display and got warmed up, the dough lost that elasticity and chewiness compared to fresh made pizza, but that's really unavoidable for anything that's been sitting on display counter.

Each hot stone rice bowl set comes with flavorful Korean side dishes and a daily soup, which is always one of the highlights of Korean cuisine. On this visit, I was offered a spicy beef and silky tofu soup, which was both rich in flavor and incredibly comforting.\n\nFor the main course, I enjoyed a whole crab and two prawns. To make it easier, they provided disposable gloves for handling the crab shell. Curious about the best way to enjoy the meal, I asked the server for a recommendation. She suggested removing the crab meat, mixing it with the hot, steaming rice, adding an egg yolk and flying fish roe, and then topping it all off with toasted seaweed.

The main bowls were delicious for both sets. However, they advertise this to be with a variety of banchans (Korean side dishes) and to be honest..I was excited for the banchans. To my disappointment, it came with the absolute bare minimum- kimchi, bean spout salad (you can get these for free at literally any traditionally korean restaurant), and cold jeon. I think the salad was just to fill the tray. The “daily soup” was also disappointing; there were literally just slivers of radish and fish cakes. I was expecting something more substantial, even something like 된장찌개. Maybe they felt pity for this sad tray of banchans bc they put a random bottle of yakult on there as well.

It was great. Westwood Plateau is literally in the mountains of Coquitlam and the views are amazing. The holes are challenging too. The neat thing is one can choose from a variety of tees. A top pro can choose the back tees at about 6800 yards whereas a newbie can choose the forward tees at about 5000 yards. I went with the middle tees. The conditioning of the course was pretty good for April. A little wet but we played the “preferred lies rule.” They have a super amount of sand bunkers. Unfortunately there were a lot of stones in those bunkers which have to be dealt with. Actually, do you know what the solution is? Don’t hit into them 🤣. There is a hitting cage to warm up but if you want to practice, you’ll have to do that at Westwood’s driving range and Executive course a mile or two away.

upset by my experience at this restaurant, both due to what I found in my food and the owner's rude response. While we were halfway through our fries, waiting for the main course, we discovered a chicken bone among them—something that appeared to be part of someone’s leftovers.\n\nWhen I brought this to the owner's attention, rather than apologizing, she attempted to justify the contamination. She argued that the chicken bone might have ended up in our fries because the same deep-fry basket and oil were used for both chicken and fries. Even if this explanation were accurate, it is entirely unacceptable and unhygienic.\n\nWe left the restaurant without receiving a proper apology, feeling unheard and disrespected.

Despite the restaurant's good reputation, we encountered several issues during our visit.\n1.\tPricing Confusion: The price for a specific dish was different for takeout compared to dining in, which wasn’t clearly indicated in the advertisement outside. This led to some confusion and disappointment considering the service fee and expected tips.\n2.\tService Issues: The waitress was not as friendly as we had hoped, and her attitude was noticeably different when serving non-Persian guests. Additionally, she insisted that I speak in Persian with her, which felt inappropriate.\n3.\tOrder Mistake: One of our orders was initially incorrect. Although the correct dish was eventually brought to us, the delay was inconvenient.\n4.\tTea and Dessert: When ordering tea and dessert, we were told the tea pot was only enough for two people, despite it being sufficient for our group of five. Also, when we asked for extra candy, the waitress’s attitude seemed unwelcoming, even though the candy was a minor request.\n5.\tBilling Process: The process of splitting the bill for tea and dessert was not accommodated. We were told that one person must pay the entire bill, and we would need to settle among ourselves later. This was quite odd and embarrassing, especially since splitting bills is a common practice.\n6. The quality of food was fair.\nWhile we appreciate the restaurant's efforts to provide a unique dining experience, these issues made our visit less enjoyable. We hope these points can be taken into consideration to improve the overall service and ensure a better experience for future guests.\nThank you."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

They seemingly opened quietly during COVID so I wasn't too sure what to expect and I'm sure a lot of people also don't realize that this location is here. So that's why I really wanted to try it out and leave a review, because I think there's great potential here and I hope they get more business!\n\nI've been here twice now, as of this review, and I think this is the type of spot where they do some dishes well, and others not as much. I often find that to be the case for restaurants with larger menus, not every place can do every dish well, and I think that's understandable! So your experience here could definitely vary depending on what you choose to order. The first time we came we ordered the Kung Pao chicken because another review said they enjoyed it, but we found it to be pretty \""meh\"" and just okay. So the next time we came we ordered a different chicken dish, the General Tsao's Chicken, and we like that one much better! Much better flavour!\n\nOther dishes that we enjoyed were the Xiao Long Bao (a dish Peaceful Restaurant is known for), the Beef Rolls (another dish they're known for), the Spicy Gingered Beef, the Vegetable \u0026 Tofu Stir-fried Noodles, and the Sichuan Stir-fried Noodles. The broth in the Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai soup-filled dumplings) was delicious and went well with the vinegar they serve it with, the vinegar really helps to cut the richness of the broth and pork filling.\n\nThe noodles also had a great texture to them, a nice bounce and chewiness that was satisfying. The Sichuan Stir-fried Noodles were my favourite as they also had a nice light heat to them. I will say that the \""Spicy\"" Gingered Beef isn't very spicy but that may be a good or bad thing depending on who you ask. It's still very tasty regardless of if you're a spice fan or not!\n\nI had family members who visited on a separate occasion from me and they said they wouldn't recommend the fried rice (a category I didn't try on my visits) and that the squid had good flavour but was not crispy enough! So maybe keep those notes in mind when you're deciding what to order!\n\nNow, the ambiance at the restaurant is where I think there could definitely be improvement. It's very clean and quiet in the restaurant, but a little too quiet as there's no music at all! So if you go on a quiet night it's a bit strange having it be so silent. I'd recommend they put some light background music of some kind on and it would be much better.\n\nAlso in terms of ambiance, they don't provide regular eating utensils, but plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates and cups. Yes this does upset me as someone who hates single use waste, but I do understand that they opened during covid and it seems to be very quiet for dine in (at least when we've gone). I suspect that they may also be short staffed, so this might be a way for them to keep costs low and keep workloads manageable with only a few staff members.\n\nI definitely hope in future that they will move toward regular cutlery and plates, but if this would be a deal breaker for your dine-in experience, then I recommend trying take out! I did see quite a few take out orders get picked up so that's definitely an option some customers are choosing, and it makes sense.\n\nAside from the music and dinnerware, the waitress was very friendly and attentive, which we appreciated. Parking is also plentiful so there's no issues there. The price is not bad at all  either, we always get at least another meal or two as leftovers so it's good value! My hope for this place is that it can work toward building a better ambiance and that people will still give it a try as they work toward that transition. I think there's room for improvement but I also think there's definitely some things they're doing well!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP0DwGVQ0f-1evWkGfS9MOh0jP9iL_22siWwZpO\u0026fid=0x0:0x9d1f8426af958dd1""],""When"":""2021-9-23""}]",

The flavor is relatively mild.  I personally like the strong peppercorn and perilla seed flavors and this one was lacking.  Also, they didn't have potatoes in the soup! I thought it was part of the recipe!! Needless to say I was a little disappointed.\n\nThen came the Reobbokki! Both the rice cakes and ramen were chewy, which was nice.  The sauce was very flavorful and on the sweet side.  I would order this again the next time.\n\nThe server was very friendly but she was pretty much on her own so at times our calls were not answered or delayed.\n\nBy the time we were leaving the restaurant was full and the vibe was great!

All the meat is sooo tender and juicy. Falls right off the bone. Soup is always super flavourful. It’s literally LIQUID HEAVEN in my books.

Donair looked good and this place had rather good ratings.\n\nFood:\nWe ordered the chicken platter. I got the upsize (+$2), which meant, more meat 😍 I had all the vegetables and sauces on the platter. The chicken was marinated and roasted well, a little dry, but given that I went a little late, it was expected. Rice was delicious, savoury and filling, wasn't too sure what stock they cooked it in, but it was amazing. Two options of salads, Caesar and Greek. I had the Caesar, it was alright. Nothing special.\n\nService:\nFriendly young dude. A little quiet. Quick prompt service.\n\nLocation:\nPretty empty at 9pm. Rather warm given that it's summer and there wasn't much ventilation/AC.\n\nPrice:\nApprox ~$9/pax\n\nWould I recommend?\nYes. Meat portions are generous (refer to pics for clarity), food is relatively filling. Get the set meal(+drink) for better value.\n\nGo with friends.

Although there was a bit of confusion when we arrived, with some customers who arrived after us being seated first, it didn’t affect our mood.

really long train the other day and was getting progressively more hungry whilst staring at the pizza sign across the street. We started off reading these other hilarious reviews, and then decided why not try it while waiting for the train. I can say I was pleasantly surprised, and I am a huge fan of the corporate, greasy, guilty pleasure pizzas. The price was really reasonable and the quality was better than expected. We only got basic topping pizzas because we were still slightly skeptical considering the mixed reviews, but I'd definitely come back to try a larger range of options next time!

I have a picture of the whole pizza that I can submit for proof. The second pizza was supposed to be lean beef and banana peppers, and the meat smelled, tasted, and appeared like pork.

The XLB were exquisitely wrapped with a thin wrapper, lots of well seasoned pork filling, but only a bit of soup. Dry fried green beans were delicious but quite salty - would be good paired with white rice. Scallion pancake beef roll was crispy, flaky, flavourful, and delicious. The Legend fried rice was loaded with toppings like shrimp, Chinese sausage, corn; a bit oily (you can see it on the spoon in the pic) but very tasty. Overall, all of the food tasted good and was great value for price.\n\nService was amazingly fast.

I brought to the attention of the cashier that I had purchased some barbari bread a few days ago, and that I was told these were baked the night before.\nUnfortunately when I took the bread home and opened it on the same day, I found both to be rotten and stale. I did not want to drive all the way back for a little refund that. The following week while shopping at the store, I informed the cashier. All I sought was a simple acknowledgment of my concern and an apology for the inconvenience. Instead, what followed was a lengthy justification about how fresh bread can spoil overnight due to moisture. Additionally, the cashier explained their return policy, stating that I should have brought back the receipt and the rotten bread for a refund.\nI felt that the response lacked empathy and a proper understanding of customer service. The interaction came off as arrogant, and it left me feeling undervalued as a customer. It is disappointing to know that, as a loyal customer, my concerns were not taken seriously. I hope Urban Gate can improve its customer service training to better handle situations like this in the future."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Marjan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJi5kZ8SK7DmiaOMIRuV-4Ttne1NBXp-Dh_P2EIrXoD-QM7Hw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""This store has a good selection of products from my home country , especially in the meat department, where the staff are polite and helpful.\nHowever, the customer service at checkout is very disappointing and rude, especially from the cashier ladies. They rarely greet  and often have a negative attitude. For example, one cashier today threw the receipt on the counter, slammed her hand on it, and walked away without saying anything. I even said hello and thank you, but she didn’t respond. When I asked the others if they had the same experience, they said they did.\nThese interactions make shopping feel unwelcoming.

And I mean unlimited. Choose from 8 different sauces, 7 different cheeses, 30 different toppings. Think of it as the Subway of pizza's. Honestly a deal so good I doubt it'll stay at the price it is for long. Definitely the best value in the area. And filling too.\n\nTo top it off. I love how you can order through the app/site. And you get a text alert when it's ready for pickup. No waiting in line or ordering in-store. They're also open until 5AM in the morning if you get the late night eats.

The noodle soup is amazing.  They’re served in a clay pot that keep it hot throughout the meal.  The portion is pretty good too.  What I like the most about this place that differs from other noodle houses is that they provide a self serve condiment section that customers can add green onion, parsley, chopped garlic, chili oil and peppercorn oil.  So customers can adjust the flavor and spiciness for their noodle.  I like garlic, so I would always add a fairly good portion so the smell would last for a few days in my breath 🤣.  Their bubble tea is surprisingly good too for a non-bubble tea place.  The pearl is chewy.  They also have a flavor we enjoy so much and haven’t been able to find it elsewhere (long yan and dates milk tea).  As there is only one server that also acts as a cashier and the bubble tea maker, don’t expect too much service.  I guess the restaurant made it clear of that when they made a QR code menu for you to order from yourself.  What they should do next is, buy a robot to deliver the food so they don’t even need a server.  Overall we enjoy the place for our noodle fix.  But the one thing they should really fix is their washrooms.

Meats in the House Special Pho left a lot to be desired though.

Long wait times for pick-up, even on weeknights.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I was particularly disheartened by the lack of freshness and variety in the vegetarian options. The few offerings they have seem like an afterthought, and none of them come close to what Pizza1 used to serve.\n\nOn top of that, the customer service is was very bad, I’ve noticed this on several visits when placing an order by phone and picking up my order,\n\nI can’t recommend this place in its current state.

Their matcha is an excellent grade and contains no added sugar or premix. An awesome drink, super tasty with fresh wholesome natural ingredients and served with a friendly five-star service. One of the reasons Ninja is so kickass, is their quality of drinks is better than everywhere else but also provides incredible value for money whilst also offering litre size options which are HUGE! They also have a very vast and customizable menu for lots of different types and flavors to curb your tastebuds cravings, whilst also offering us great plant-based milk options (Silk refrigerated) on top of dairy or milk powder based..

to Cactus Club but the line was crazily long. We came to the weekend when there was a festival at the mall.\n\nSo we searched for the highest-rating restaurant nearby and found this place. The food was so good, it blew our mind.\n\nWe had a spicy shredded potato appetizer. It was spicy but still manageable for us.\n\nTheir noodles were very different from what we normally saw at other noodle places, so we just kind of picked two very different ones. One was glassy and in chili oil soup, the other one was thin pull noodles in a relatively clear booth. Both were very flavourful and we were so glad that we found this place.

When my friend chose not to leave a tip and selected the no-tip option on the payment machine, the server rudely informed us that tip was not included and repeatedly canceled the transaction and tried to force us to leave her a tip. As for the food, we ordered the raw crab, beef tartar bowl, bulgogi bowl, and clam bowl. The only dish worth noting was the beef tartar bowl; the rest of the items were disappointing.

If you've never been here before, the way to order is by self-service touchscreen stations they have on the left side of the counter. We're so used to just ordering to the staff and completely missed the touchscreen stations 😆.\n\nOne thing this ramen place has it going is the noodle. They're perfectly cooked with a nice bite and chew to them. You can choose between pork-based or chicken-based broth. We both chose pork-based since we like to base things on traditional first when trying new places. The pork-based is very thick and  creamy. If you're a fan of those really thick and creamy ramen, this place is for you. For us, while we like rich broth, this one is more on the too thick and too rich side of things. I also find for the TanTan ramen, that the broth is too much on the salty side of things. My husband got the chashu ramen and the salt level is much better, just right. Maybe we should've gone with the chicken-based broth instead...\n\nAvg price is somewhere between $13-14/ bowl. You can make it a combo and pick 1 small side dish like gyoza, karaage or donburi, etc. Drinks not included in combo. So for 2 people, if you order 2 combos, expect to pay somewhere along the line of $40 or so. Price-wise, I feel like you can have a better ramen at a sit-down restaurant. You might be paying a little more, but not THAT much more."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOScIYJALBSiF24q2-KcOHh_ChTNlQ-S70oyD2K\u0026fid=0x0:0x9a7fc6ef7ee65139""],""When"":""2022-7-29""},{""Name"":""Alex Barros"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLbGQfDFyWBFf-SHj8dHqz7fJQ6yDYj9me5-vlKbsRH7vrJMA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""The noodles in the Ramen has a strange chemical  smell.

We gave a 5 for atmosphere as we have read reviews stating how comfortable the diner is and therefore had to give a 5 for that reason. We had the Bacon Cheeseburger and Clubhouse sandwich. Both were delicious. My husband said that the burger is one of the best that he has had. The burger was loaded with tomatoes, bacon and onions and he really liked the burger sauce that came with it as well. The bacon was thick and my husband said that the caramelized onions made the burger. I also found my Clubhouse to have been very good also with thick bacon, ham, and a generous amount of grilled chicken. The fries were crispy and the picture with the Clubhouse did not have all the fries that came with the order. We both have left overs for tomorrow. We are always cautiously optimistic when ordering home delivery due to the food not being fresh out of the kitchen. Well, we were so pleased with our meals and will definitely be ordering again.

and definitely will be back but most likely grabbing take out over dine in if coming on the weekend. Came here for the first time on Sat, Oct 20th for brunch at 11:15 AM, it was packed and we (2) put our name on the waiting list, it took about 45 mins to get a seat which was the only negative but we figured it must be good considering how busy it was so we waited. The seating is a bit too close for my preference to the point there is no privacy to have a conversation while you eat but I get they are likely trying to maximize the seating, it's also a pay up front before you order type of establishment so just keep that in mind. Not my favourite since I like to tip well but based off the service so in these pre pay scenarios I unfortunately just have to go 15% because I'm hoping it's going to be good, but I don't blame them with all the shady people these days doing dine and dash and etc.\n\nThat's where the complaints end, the food was absolutely amazing and the staff are very friendly and welcoming.

First, we came on a Sunday around noon for brunch. Sundays are a very busy day, so we expected a waitlist which is totally fine. We waited about an hour for our table. There was so many people leaving, after an hour of not receiving a call we came in again to check how it was going, they apologized said that it was so hectic they were behind with calling the customers. When we finally ordered and sat down, it took quite a while to get our food. I ordered the chicken sandwich, and I was really disappointed when they put pickled peppers and onions on it when it never stated on the menu that it was on the burger. I didn’t bother saying anything because you could see the staff were already really struggling to keep up with all the orders. Second my two friends ordered the acai bowl, and one was completely forgotten all together. We had to go remind them that we never received an order. I do not blame the workers that day, if anything we really felt bad for how stressful everything was. From my understanding aswell is a lot of them were very new, and being new while working a Sunday ,plus understaffed is understandably very overwhelming. We even noticed they were accidently overcharging guests, and not being able to refund them due to the new machine system. One worker really stood out though; I believe her name was Lea. She was so kind and was going above and beyond to try and fix all the problems and issues that the restaurant was having. She was really trying her best and it was lovely interacting with her. She alone made our experience a lot better. The food we received itself was really well made and very delicious. ( Besides having the pickles peppers/onions on my sandwich ) But Like I said before, I had such high hopes for this place, unfortunately due to our experience and the stress it caused us , this place would not be our first choice to come back to.

Intrigued by the positive reviews, I decided to visit during a weekday at off-peak hours, shortly after 3 PM.\n\nI ordered the spicy pork cutlet, and it did not disappoint. The batter and pork thickness were excellent, and the dish was well-executed. Although the sauce was flavorful and creamy, it wasn't the typical accompaniment for Korean pork cutlets and was spicier than I expected. I didn't quite like the sauce tbh.\n\nHowever, I loved the texture and the flavour of the rice, and the sliced cabbage was fresh. Next time, I would opt for the non-spicy version, though I couldn't find it on the menu this time.\n\nLocated on the 2nd floor of Henderson Mall's food court, the area was clean and well-maintained. Like many Korean restaurants, Doni uses a small remote that rings and buzzes when your order is ready. The employee was kind, and the ordering process was smooth.\n\nSome have complained about long wait times for their orders. Despite there being few customers, my order took about 10-15 minutes, which suggests they fry the cutlet fresh upon ordering. Otherwise, the wait time wouldn't make sense.\n\nConsidering the inflated food prices elsewhere, Doni is very affordable. I'm definitely returning to try their Korean-Chinese menu items and dumplings.

Gordon Ramsay’s burgers are good in their own way. The 24-Hour burger’s Bbq sauce kept this dish interesting imo, while the Hell’s Kitchen burger was not so-in-your-face, as its subtle flavors from its ingredients kept this a pleasant dish to enjoy through a chat. For our drinks, the Espresso Martini tasted like a chocolatey dessert and the Earl and the Empress was like an iced tea punch.

The first couple of bites were yummy, nothing out of the ordinary, but it didn’t take long before my boyfriend noticed that his chicken was not fully cooked through and still very pink. He refused to eat anymore and then we had to make dinner, which negated us buying take out and waiting for it. We wanted to treat ourselves to dinner that we did not have to make or clean up after.

It’s not your typical grocery-store bought bread, and it plays a huge role in the flavor factor.\nI was inclined to get the soup since a lot of the other customers at the time were getting them, and I can see why. It tastes homemade and fresh, which makes me consider trying all their soups.\nThey also serve daily specials like chicken teriyaki with rice which I also enjoyed. The portion was generous for the price, and the chicken was crispy which made it much more enjoyable than the typical soft/mushy chicken teriyaki from other places.\nThis café is in a secluded area and it’s one of the healthier available options for breakfast/lunch. It’s also nice to see how the staffs here know their regulars’ names and usual orders. This to me means that they are tasty enough to come back! I would recommend this place to anyone who is passing by and need a quick bite."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPwCsSIUWY4XzdvVSlTnZEnJ0Ubabs22REdsSGB\u0026fid=0x0:0x2a2857896adc1231""],""When"":""2019-2-4""}]",

It was hearty, flavorful, and incredibly satisfying.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the pizzas very much, and I can confidently say that Papa Leo’s offers some of the best pizza in Coquitlam.

I again called and told them I can’t eat this onion bhaji I will bring in your store and eat it and tell if you can eat it then she told me not to come today (12/18/24) come the following day. I said to her, but I take out food because I needed for the night not for tomorrow and she replied me again not to come.\nThis is not first time earlier also she refused to give me order as per the instructions saying we do not make tawa prantha’s here and never made before. But before I talked to her I always ordered tawa prantha’s once a week. After last month talking to her, she told she can’t make it. I did not made any ordered in this restaurant and today I ordered from DoorDash instead of calling and still they did not follow the instructions and made whatever they wanted to make or liked to make. Or I would say it was already made dish they gave me. Because why would a chief will not follow the instructions?

The low coffee quality sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to all the rest of  the items on the menu, and though my partner and I love picking a\u0026w as our go-to breakfast on-the-go, the iced coffee always disappoints and consistently lacks flavour, is way below average and really just comparable to a cup of water.

Clearly, they don’t care about providing good customer service. They refused to give me a refund, and I had no choice but to accept two drumsticks instead of the thigh I originally ordered.\n\nIf you buy chicken from this place, be cautious.

The ham was lacking as well, just one pieces on each slice.\n\nI understand that I cannot expect too much for $10, but clearly the savings resulted in a less than stellar product. Had I known I would get less toppings, I would’ve ordered a pizza at full price.\n\nI’ve ordered promos from pizza franchises and I’ve never had the quality drop off this much.

The place where the sushi is prepared runs adjacent to the tables in a bar format with a kitchen for hot food further inside.\n\nStaff were patient in waiting for us to peruse the menu and order and took the time to read our order back to us to make sure they got it right. Sushi was prepared upon ordering and you could see some of it being made from the table.\n\nPresentation of each dish was clean and simple. All the fish was very fresh and each piece held together when picked up. The rice was also well-made.\n\nPrice is similar to other independent sushi places in the area.

My friends and I ordered 2 rounds of 2 large Asahis that were ice cold and refreshing.\n\nWe ordered the parents’ meals shortly after although it took a while for the server to take our order and she walked away before all of the adults could order (she only took 2 out of 4 orders).\n\nThe first round of food for the teens came out in a timely manner but our food took an extremely long time. We also had to ask for soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, they did not come on our sushi plates.\n\nWe were there for almost an hour before we got our food.  There was only one chef making the sushi and I assumed it took so long because we ordered the torched and specialty sushi.\n\nThe wait was worth it though - the Volcano roll was absolutely delicious, among the best specialty rolls I’ve ever had.  The Oshi salmon sushi was okay.  Everyone else really enjoyed their meals.\n\nEven though our food took so long, we didn’t make a fuss about it and had a great time.  However, we had only finished our meal 15 minutes before the server told us that we needed to leave for the next guests.  We apologized and left but were really put off by this.  There was only one table for two that came in the entire 1.5 hours we were there and there was still another table for 4 empty.  No take out orders were picked up during that time either.\n\nWe stayed outside of the restaurant for another 30 minutes socializing with our friends and no one came in so it was odd that they told us to leave. Again, this was during a quiet time at 4:20pm when we were told to leave.\n\nThe food is great, but not the friendliest service unfortunately, hence the 3 stars for service.  The server almost seemed annoyed when we first came in and told her we were a party of 9 and when we asked her for the ginger, wasabi and soy sauce.\n\nThe bill for our family of 5 came to $120 and we got 2 rolls for each kid, a prawn tempura, 2 nigiri salmon sushi, a volcano roll, a salmon oishi, and 2 large Asahi.\n\nBottom line, yes I would recommend this place for good, fresh sushi but be aware that there may be a seating time limit even if they take a long time to get your food out and there are no guests waiting for a table and the server is not friendly and made us feel unwelcome."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPKwXerCD0i2Kk5Me-1YG5NfRuiKA89k6wCgt3R\u0026fid=0x0:0x3ffd3bcec282eb32""],""When"":""2023-11-5""},{""Name"":""Ads"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVwDyuvQtXP_VygmU1rNXhUJ0mc48E4h1QtDkdEfrlXmuS-mYhL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""This is a quaint, family ran operating local business by a lovely couple.

My wife and I were enjoying our coffee after finishing our meal when the server brought the check—completely understandable, especially when tables need to turn over for waiting guests. But this time, there were four empty tables, and no one was waiting. Moments later, while we were still sipping our coffee, the server returned with the cordless payment unit and stood by our table. We were both caught off guard, thinking, “What…?” We paid because the payment unit was already there, and the server was waiting, but the interaction felt rushed.\n\nHaving owned a restaurant in downtown Vancouver, I understand the need to turn tables efficiently. That said, there’s an unspoken etiquette between servers and guests, and this instance felt a bit abrupt—particularly since the restaurant wasn’t busy.  It’s a small issue, and I’m sure it wasn’t intentional, but I wanted to share this experience in the hopes it’s not repeated for other guests.\n\nOf course, we will continue visiting Big Flat Pancake because we love the food, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is just some constructive feedback for management or ownership to consider.\n\nThank you, and see you again soon!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN3DgZTp8jMRgeo2EOBKceMPW-1SSt0lYSYOwaO\u0026fid=0x0:0xaaebff47a4a99ef2""],""When"":""2024-12-10""}]",

The meals are nothing fancy for $8.99 and $7.99, but as diners who visit IKEA once a year, the food has a nostalgic and comforting feel. The mashed potatoes were creamy, and the different balls had good flavour. I was a big fan of their vegan chocolate torte, which was rich and decadent without the use of eggs and gluten! I'd definitely order this again, and appreciate the vegan dessert option! Water is self-serve by the other beverages and is complimentary.\n\nWe unknowingly went on Swe-dish Thursdays, so it was packed for the lunch hour with many families in line for food. There was a bit of a wait, but the line moves quickly (finding seating is another question, but we were fortunate to find a table soon after paying). I was looking forward to having their Veggie Balls, but had to settle for the Plant Balls as they weren't serving the Veggie Balls on their menu.\n\nThe only minor issue we had was when we were paying full price (because we weren't IKEA Family Members). We were happy to pay full price because we were unaware of the Thursday special and were not signed up for membership, but the cashier had insisted we keep the receipt as they said we'd be able to get a partial refund on that food bill if we became IKEA Family Members at a later date. While we were eating, we signed up for membership, but another staffer in the restaurant area said we could only use it for future meal savings and couldn't get the refund. It wasn't a big issue for us, but we were left questioning why the cashier was insistent about a refund as we hadn't asked for one in the first place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMKuqoOjwtD_cF8WJfhhDxkulxgeMyJ_DngE1Xd\u0026fid=0x0:0x59278ff7cf09cddf""],""When"":""2024-8-3""},{""Name"":""eddy wong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8Fjpj3y8teHQ4LqbC4PHR8whbU4-XOrTXEwklI9bGRqZLRD20=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Friday Friday Friday only this Black Friday!

The ladies who are both front and back are not English speaking but we are okay with the idea that they don't cater to a Caucasion crowd that much (but they should try to). We have gone there 4 times now and the first two the food justified the sparse interior.  But the last visit about 9 months ago for take out dinner not so much. We live a 30 minute drive away so we expect a special feast when we go there and the prices are not cheap. They charge as if they are top drawer and they have been in the past in my opinion. Their take out this time was skimpy!!!  The deep fried won ton is now some store bought cheap and frugal version and the portion we received was unsatisfying for us three. It was not the robust and plentiful won ton we received on our first visit. And for twenty bucks we get a meagre portion. Sweet and sour really not great either and again for the price why go so cheap! Lastly our fish dish was bland and boring and served in a medium takeaway plastic bowl that could have been a good meal for one, but was rationed out by the spoonful to be fair.\nSo what is your attraction Deer Garden? Friendly welcoming service from your ladies? No thank yous and we didn't feel like our business was appreciated. Good food in portions that justified our 60 bucks?  Nope.

Our server provided attentive service, checking in on us periodically. However, there were instances when we wanted to place additional orders but had to wait for a while before our server returned. We ordered a diverse selection of dishes, including the rose spaghettini, Julius salad, everything grilled cheese, hard bean co burger, and hard chicken crunch. The handheld dishes were pretty good. The hard chicken crunch lived up to its name, delivering an exceptionally crispy texture. The Julius salad was enjoyable, although the dressing could have benefited from a touch more acidity.

The waitlist link online didn't work but we didn't need to worry about that because there were tables open when we arrived. The atmosphere was both aesthetically pleasing and comfortable with bright, warm lighting, and the two waiters were very polite.\nI tried the Saku on Broadway in Vancouver once years ago and loved it and was impressed again here. I got the veggie curry and also their seasonal cinnamon ginger drink. Their curry sauce is earthy and so rich; I am in love. The veggies were fried to be nice and soft inside and not too oily. The sides are also very good. I subbed out the tonjiru for a mini cold udon. The noodles were tender and the broth was also really flavourful. This was my first time trying cold udon and I was pleasantly surprised by how different flavours come out in the cold broth. The cinnamon ginger drink was very unique with the warm cinnamon ginger flavour in a refreshing soda.\nMy meal with tip was about $40. Although it’s a little expensive, the portions are generous as is and you can stretch the value even more by ordering complimentary refills for your sides.

The food is incredibly delicious and perfectly suited to our taste. The restaurant is spotless, and the staff is always welcoming and friendly. The owners are very attentive and take the time to check in and ensure guests are enjoying their meals, which is such a nice touch.\n\nWe usually order takeout, but honestly, the food tastes even better when dining in. The portions are generous—we ordered one appetizer, a bowl of rice, a vegetable dish, and our favorite, Kong Pao Chicken, and still had leftovers to take home!\n\nThe only downside is that parking is limited, but luckily, it wasn’t busy today, so we didn’t have any trouble.\n\nOverall, this is one of our favorite spots, and we’ll definitely keep coming back!

The spicy chicken plate is probably good for like 1.5 people...for 2 guys I would recommend ordering another side to feel a bit more full.\n\nThe Rose tteokbokki was just ok. It was basically just rice cakes smothered in KD Mac and Cheese sauce...at least that's how it tasted to me. You're better off just buying a box of KD Mac \u0026 Cheese on sale for under 1 dollar and cooking your own rice cakes with this sauce.\n\nGetting a table was also quite difficult on a busy Saturday night.

Located in Coquitlam, the restaurant is tucked away in a small strip mall and is a real hidden gem.\n\nWe ordered a variety of different dishes for dinner.\n\nThe Pan fried black bean noodle was really nice. Quantity wise it was great the portion was massive. The different kinds of seafood, octopus, squid and shrimp really complimented the noodles.\n\nThe sweet and sour deep fried pork was also really good. It wasn’t overly greasy or soft, had a nice crunch on the outside and went well with a tangy sauce.\n\nThe fried chicken was good. A bit spicy but really solid. Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and a nice mildly spicy tangy sauce to it with plenty of vegetables and onions. It was delightful.\n\nThe real star was the cream saewoo shrimp. They were giant, and the sweet mayonnaise drizzle to it was pleasant.\n\nOverall, I would say that this place has better eats than most of the Korean spots around North road. Nice small location, cozy feeling to the place and the excellent portion sizes really make this a place I would return to and try other dishes at!

This restaurant prepares it exceptionally well. I’ve had the chance to try it a few times in Turkey, but nowhere was as good as this place.\nSecondly, I’d like to mention the cleanliness of the restaurant. Restaurants reflecting Middle Eastern culture usually look a bit shabby and not very modern. This restaurant was different; it was both very modern and very clean. When I asked to see their kitchen, I saw that everyone was working according to hygiene rules. Additionally, their kitchen was spotless.\nLastly, the owner of the restaurant hosted us wonderfully; he was very attentive. I haven’t had such delicious Iranian food in a long time.\nI tried to think of a negative aspect, but honestly, there isn’t any.

Its seems odd that they are unwilling to accommodate customers. I took off 2⭐ for both of those issues. The food was good, service was slow, and having to ask for coffee top-ups seemed like something that just added to my complaints. I've done a lot of reviews, and I usually try to be forgiving with concerns, but the service is unacceptable here. I won't be returning here anytime soon. Can't recommend at this time."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN-oMA0AFHBcWwp4ulRhvTvU_KC-OBfIJdMBqop\u0026fid=0x0:0xb2e3be892520b306""],""When"":""2022-2-6""}]",

If you love sweets and fruits, Cora would be a quick, delicious breakfast place for you. There was some savoury options but to be honest, there were more sweet things than savoury. I had a April 89 crepe with half chocolate and half custard and the crepe was pretty good. I guess it wasn't the right choice for me though; it was a lot of sugar first thing in the morning which I should have thought about it so it was my bad. The fruit I really liked was the cantaloupe. Very ripe and sweet. The strawberry was a little sour and not really sweet but that's fine. All the other fruits were normal but the only one I really couldn't eat was the pineapple. It was almost like dry and flavourless. Also, it was a lot of crepe for me, so it'd probably be nice to share with someone. The person with the benedict didn't like the way the potatoes were done, it was like eating plain boiled potatoes, would prefer if it had some more crispness and season to it. Maybe if you ask for the potatoes to be done the way you'd prefer then you should do that. But overall the fruits were good except for a few that weren't, and the display of the food was spot on. Loved how they decorated the plates. The server was polite and nice and quick to serve us whatever we needed.

Finally decided for a revisit to this place which I haven’t been to for years.\n\nInside is one of those smaller cozy place; clean, typical and nothing too fancy. I was glad the server seated me on a bigger table instead one of those midget size ones. The server informed me they have a Tri-city special set menu for $35, quick glanced and I opted out on that. Here were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Miso soup (complimentary). Pretty basic but thank you, nice to have a hot soup to warm up to from the cold.\n2. Appetizer tempura. Pretty basic and as it should be.\n3. Oyster motoyaki. I was glad they were on the shell but didn’t know it’s their own version of it; cold, marinated with cold pan fried onions on top. The cold oysters didn’t really do it for me. Is it really that hard to find just the basic fresh oyster motoyaki baked with Japanese mayo anywhere? lol\n4. Foie gras nigiri. Okay this is one of those must order item from here. Loved how the way it is put together and seared. Rich, buttery and creamy that literally melts in your mouth. Very nice!\n5. Spider roll. A little bit too basic, could be more generous on the soft shell crab.\n6. Saba shio yaki. It was okay, pretty straightforward dish.\n7. Assorted sashimi. It was okay, the Akami could be a better cut.\n8. Chopped scallops, uni, amaebi nigiris. The chopped scallop was fresh, the uni was a generous amount, I like how the amaebi head was prepared so easier to eat.\n9. Albacore toro, Akami, chu toro. The albacore toro was a bit dry, the Akami was fresh, the chu toro just make it to the satisfactory level (as you can tell it lost some of its beautiful colour already).\n\nThe restaurant is conveniently located on the corner of Lougheed Hwy and Shaughnessy Street in Port Coquitlam. There are plenty of free parkings in the plaza. Inside the restaurant offers a causal comfortable dining atmosphere.\n\nThe food was okay, could be better in some departments, but overall satisfactory level.\n\nAs for the service, the staffs here were very friendly and welcoming.

I blame the Limes Alexandra lol.\n\nWe always have a great time at Samz and the Staff and everyone is always so accommodating\n\nAnd of course some of us walk home as Samz is close by, and the others took Uber home. Always do it right or don't do it at all I say...\n\nForgot all about our lunch, basically it was just my brother and I who ate. I had the Samz Burger Bacon and Cheese with Shrooms with Fries, and my brother had some Hot Wings and deep fried pickles. Every thing came out hot and ready to go. And I have to admit I really enjoy the bottomless Fries as well  ( great touch ) as our mom loves that as well when my brother and I take her to Samz for lunch.\n\nAnd finally in the posted Video  Steve'd has left the building lol.

Can't get this type of noodle in many places. Beef brisket was tough and not much flavor. Would try the pork riblets next time.\n\n-------------\nIn terms of flavor, this has got to be one of the wosrt ones I have been to.\n\nCentury egg and pork congee - flavorless. No salt. No base whatsoever.\n\nHand shredded chicken salad - extremely small. Most places that give smaller portions have expensive jellyfish in the salad. This place is only chicken and preserved vegetables so there is no need for it to be half the size of the plate, smaller than other specialty chef items.\n\nDeep fried chicken knees - giant pieces only to find out it is 80% batter. The garlic salt and spice just sat at the bottom and the chicken was never stirred with it.\n\nMinced pork fried glutinous rice dumpling - the glutinous rice wasnt very sweetened. The insides were ok. The only good thing is that it came with 4 pieces instead of 3.\n\nOverall, the dimsum dishes were not very good. The prices are high with poor quality dishes. Maybe their dinner menu makes up for it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNRL0bQXOdXOmLCPckVyE40kKNkpOpokL1auaQZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x2f02bed8d172b222""],""When"":""2023-5-27""},{""Name"":""Brayden M."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVPBZNPVNqHW8dSCFike-NLUMkuCrsmT6ZW7ysivwMhyRbgUxkL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Came here for lunch again, and it's always a great experience here!

to start this negative review I would like to mention that I work in food service in a very busy establishment on UBC campus so I understand it can get stressful but... this place was terrible.\n\nFirstly, when my husband and I walked in there was only 2 other customers and about 5 workers working, yet every single table besides 1 were filthy. I've worked at Subway before my current job for 7-8 years and we would never allow the lobby to look like this. It was disgusting. That's not even mentioning their soft drink station that was also a sticky mess.\n\nSecondly, they don't give napkins or utensils without you asking? What? It's basic practice where I work to ALWAYS give cutlery and napkins for all orders. And when I had to go up to ask I was waiting a while even though there were workers who saw me and ignored me. One worker, who I assume is the supervisor due to her different shirt, was working on a tablet for nearly the entire time I was waiting and she looked over at me more than once and didn't even bother to ask if I needed anything. She even walked fully by me and ignored me. I had to ask the cashier when she was available, though she was also intending on ignoring me until I spoke up and asked for the items I needed.\n\nThere was also a woman waiting several minutes to order when my husband and I were waiting on our food. Why?\n\nFood establishments need to understand that their two most important things are CUSTOMERS and CLEANLINESS. This location seems to put both these things (especially cleaniness) at the bottom of their priority lists.\n\nLastly, while the food was passable, they stack EVERYTHING haphazardly into a single bag regardless of what you get. So are they stingy with bags and napkins? Or? It's very strange.\n\nTerrible terrible location that has had these same issues for several years, it seems, looking at old reviews. This just tells me that the owners do not care. They haven't changed anything in years, so I would recommend NOT coming here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPKuZFrgWOPQHt4eI8L_kWqd27VE-OVj0DqV6o3\u0026fid=0x0:0xd49ddca9db87b135""],""When"":""2024-10-19""},{""Name"":""eee envy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUUv6ustbctHgayROab6GPATif-uph4IK_tRlciz6FR3y83NqpH=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We waited almost 10 minutes to be helped at the counter and ended up having to go through the drive through to get help even though the inside was still open.

restaurant on Canada day after the fireworks at the nearby Lafarge lake. We were surprised it was still open so late! It’s not a Michelin style fine dining, but let me say this, if you are looking for an authentic Korean food experience, you’ll find it here. Service is fast, no nonsense, no over exaggerated descriptions of the dishes, straight to the point meal options. And unlike the popular Korean bbq experience (which I also enjoy), this is different that it brings you the culinary experience of what a regular Korean family would cook and serve at home as their daily meals. I was so impressed by their pork feet meal, it took me back 20 years to the days I would enjoy this dish as a snack with beer. It was truly a nostalgic moment. Another thing to be mindful of… do not assume you can handle these family size portions. They are there to bring you comfort not just in the duty of flavour packed dishes, but also in the size of the meals!

I am so happy to experience such an athentic cuisine at this restaurant. I and my friend were so ready to eat a lot today because we waited for right day to come here and today was the day :) we ordered chicken feet, pork entrails, and pork long feet. We assumed that it would be excessive portion for only two of us but we could not give up on  any of them. 😎First of all, the pork long feet exceeded our expectation. Both taste and portion were so great and 'prawn and chive pancake' was served as an appetizer before pork feet(it was complimentary😍😍). And speaking of the pork feet, it was the best, and the best...🤩 I have never tasted this pork feet  ever since I came to Canada. I can feel how authentic it is. And I also was able to feel the enthusiasm of chef toward the food. It was obvious that the cuisine was cooked with lots of love and effort. And next surprising one was stir-fried entrails. Not many restaurants serves it in Vancouver because it is not easy to get rid of the bad smell of the pork intestine. However, this place did such an awesome job on it. I barely noticed that it is pork intestine. It was pleasantly chewy, and two sauces came along with it went perfectly well. It magnified the nutty flavor of the pork intestine. I loved and loved it. And last one that I expected even in my dream was spicy chicken feet. It was perfectly marinated with the sauce and I am personally not so good at dealing with spiciness, but it was not overly spicy. I did not drink a lot of water, which was good because I need some space in my stomach for the food!! And we also ordered a rice ball because chicken feet and rice ball must be ordered together. They go along so well! Overall, my experience at this place was truly the best. And although it is pretty far for me to visit here, I will be regularly going to this place to make my tongue and stomach happy. I must recommend this place for all, especially those who are having homesickness or just sick and tired of ordinary cuisine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMtCS1YYlVBeEban5iMJfh-iSxkWQ-gLpiIaYX4\u0026fid=0x0:0x22e97376de3aac1b""],""When"":""2020-9-29""},{""Name"":""Daniel Yim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLQasZok9PzRbGWAPT2JykQMeRGEE-9L_G4T1fQkEB1IiM4sw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had an amazing dining experience at Vesta Grill and Korean Cuisine, it caught my family with such a pleasant surprise!

We received them shortly after I wrote this review.\n\nThis still could have been handled better.  I will give 2 stars instead of 1. And from what I have recently read in the reviews, this isn’t the first time that a customer has had a poor experience. You can and should do better.\n\nPizza was ok. The chicken bites were burnt and so we called to ask for a refund on the chicken bites. I am giving it 1 star simply because there are so many better pizza places that I would rather give my hard earned money to.\n\nWhen we called to ask for a refund on just the burnt chicken bites, we were told a refund for burnt food somehow wouldn’t be possible but no clear explanation given as to why. Then they actually tried to make excuses for sending burnt food to paying customers and I quote: “We have to cook the chicken bites twice and when we cook them the second time, there is a possibility that they can burn.” So after a lot of back and forth over the phone and no manager making an effort to speak to us themselves, we finally agreed to have them send over more chicken bites. That was almost 2 hours ago and we have received nothing.\n\nIt is clear that they’re content to take money from their customers and deliver subpar product. There are better pizza places in the immediate area that have better customer service. We paid full price for burnt food and they tried to justify charging us for it.\n\nI am interested to see what the owner’s response is going to be- so far, we are not impressed. In all fairness, we waited to see if they would be able to make things right but we’re still waiting for those chicken bites 2 hours after the fact.\n\nA waste of our time and money. We won’t be ordering from them again. They also seem to have no integrity or accountability to their paying customers. It’s actually just plain shameful.\n\nSo many better choices- Reggiano’s is next door. Little Caesar’s, Dominos… anywhere else really except this pizza place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMp0P_shcxjkNJDeooV1dxpEsgOP6fpuGgtm_an\u0026fid=0x0:0x175f09e007712f58""],""When"":""2024-10-25""},{""Name"":""Ezequiel Contesti"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUSkKOImdZkHeMd77KVSS4zxVxKuVO40nFJaHiN9yp69aDD7gD1=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""So far, this is the best pizza slices in the area.
