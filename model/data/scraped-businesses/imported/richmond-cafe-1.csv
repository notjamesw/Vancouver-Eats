They didn't ask for how she wanted her eggs done though, so definitely inform them if you specifically want a doneness. The other execution or weird decision was putting arugula underneath hot bacon. It was wilted, unseasoned, bitter and a bit wet. That was a fairly weird decision instead of quickly dressing it with something and putting it off to the side so it wouldn't wilt. I could understand if it was cooked or quickly tossed in a pan, but it was just raw arugula.\n\nMy absolute favourite thing here was the Danish.

The interior feels clean and well-planned out, with a cute photo booth, too.\n\nI tried the Fisherman's Feast and the Korean Fried Chicken \u0026 Waffles, and the latter was especially delicious. The portions are great, and each dish comes with very nice complementary sides, like the hash brown blocks, assorted house-made pickles, and creative sauces (the waffles came with a gochujang-inspired syrup).\n\nI've read a few comments about service, but it's probably as good as it can be with the limited staff and busy clientele, as there was a line to get in.

I met up with a friend to catch up, and we made a spontaneous decision to go to Miion instead of the cafe next door, drawn in by the cute interior. However, we started to regret our decision decieved by appearance as we sat in the cafe and witnessed multiple (10+) errors with peoples' orders and transactions. There is no doubt that the staff were kind, but the service was just not efficient. Many times staff would make a drink and call out to ask who ordered it, finding out nobody did. They brought drinks to other tables in to-go cups when the customers had asked to dine in. They also brought a steamed milk to another customer who did not order it and did not realize he was accidentally charged for it. Although they do have the confusion of take out and dine-in customers, there are only 3 small tables in the cafe. I think they need a better system, i.e order numbering system to keep track of who ordered what items. We also observed that the staff kept switching roles from making drinks to working as cashier, so there was not smooth communication and knowledge of orders.\n\nMy friend and I had ordered a matcha cream cheese muffin to share and two drinks. They had brought the muffin first but we wanted to wait for the drinks to have it together. It reached the 1hr mark of us sitting in the cafe and we still had not received our drinks (it already took 30mins to receive the muffin despite them only needing to remove it from the display case, not reheat). We asked the staff where the drinks were, and they told us that they were still making them. The woman we had asked returned to us 5 minutes later and ask us what we ordered because they had in fact not started making the drinks. She then asked us to go pay for them, when I explained that I already had. After this, we recieved the drinks about 10mins later.\n\nI have never seen genmaicha so green before and I initially thought they had mistakenly made a matcha. I was amazed that it tasted so fresh yet had the nuttiness of the roasted rice. The matcha was even more vibrant and smooth, not astringent at all. The matcha cream cheese muffin was cold but moist and creamy, and the matcha flavour was actually strong, leaving a nice aftertaste. In many other matcha desserts, they taste too sweet with too little flavour even if it appears green. If their food/drinks weren't so good I think I would've had to give them 2 stars.\n\nThe seating of the cafe was very limited with about three 2-person sized tables. There wasn't much space to put our jackets or bags either, so we both held everything in our laps. They decorate the space to be very clean and homey so I hope they continue to update the seating/environment to reflect that!\n\nI understand that there are often little errors and miscommunications in customer service, but it felt like Miion was just continually making them due to systematic problems. I hope this feedback can allow them to improve, especially in such a high traffic and competitive location. I would love to come back to try more of their drinks, but only if I know I can receive what I ordered without so much confusion."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO_NQYKlN5Ok6PvPSnzy8VHoYhGt_ky3ynDhM8m\u0026fid=0x0:0x8ba9cd64a6ece30""],""When"":""2024-12-9""},{""Name"":""Nick Go"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWy1wVzdpckJ20S9UmFPOeDxIPDcWXe0ZStOYXqUqdan15D_SEi=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Richmond finally has a good independent coffee shop!\n\nMiion is super cute, the branding, interior design, furniture selection and overall vibe are \""chef's kiss\"".

She said yes but I need to wait for couple of minutes.  I was like sure.  She also asked me if I want some sugar on my iced latte. So friendly . She's the only one working that morning i feel so bad cause she just open 10am and I ordered a Waffle 😅 she's already busy before that. So she gave me first my latte and I just stayed on the corner waiting for my waffle I expect it will take a while cause she is so busy but no less than 3 mins. I feel inlove more cause of the smell so fresh why she is making it. Overall I purchased $7 something. Not bad at all. The Waffle came in 2 pcs with whipped cream on top and maple syrup on the side.

Also, we enjoyed our coffees yet again.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nBeen here many times over the years and it’s always been packed. They were quiet during my mid afternoon visit on a Sunday last weekend though, most likely due to the dine in restrictions. However, I do suggest swinging by if you are looking for coffee. They have some patio seating and a ton of parking in the lot, in case you’d rather chill in your car instead.\n\nI like their mochachillos, caramel lattes and hot chocolates.

We later sat down at a table that was unmarked, but within the cafe itself. A few minutes later, staff started to rearrange the tables and we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of a travel agency itinerary presentation.\n\nWhile certainly a unique experience, this should be more organized as we felt quite awkward being in the middle of a presentation. The tables could have been marked or cordoned off if an event was occurring. The volume (understandably for the attendees) was also quite loud and echoed throughout the whole cafe.\n\nI feel that if there are multiple businesses (cafe and travel agency) in a venue, there should be proper communication to patrons if an event is happening. Additionally, the specialty coffee was quite bland / bitter and not representative of what the original Fresh Press had to offer.\n\nWill reevaluate later on as understandably this store just opened, but there is room for significant improvement."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""張瑞彤 Tong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVfmFHk-gJReMv-zkJ5jC-PM12mclXLNiI16cZTFDkqo4LbIVqT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Soooo good\nA coffee shop that cooperates with travel agencies.

You need to get the 熱乾麵 dry noodles. I came around 11:30 and they already had orders piled around them. My order took around 10 minutes or less. I ordered 2 portions of the dry noodles and a portion of the 小面窩 small donut lookalike. The first time I had the dry noodles I feel in love with the sesame flavour and the crunchy pickled veggie inside. It might not look like a lot of noodles but it is very filling. I realized after ordering two portions that the way they season the noodles depends on the chef because both bowls of noodles were different even though it was the same dish. One was spicier and saltier than the other. So it really depends on your luck if you get a good bowl of noodles. The crunchy pickled veggies on the inside balance on the dish well. You MUST GET the 小面窩. It's crunchy chewy and very bad for you but good for your soul. It soaks up sauce really well and goes with everything. One portion of 3 is not enough. The price of the noodles is $7.90 and although there is no protein in it I think the price is reasonable. The xiaomianwo is 3 for $2. One serving is not enough for 2 people. You need one serving per person because it's just that delicious. Yes albeit on the oily side, but still delicious and would go so well with soupy dishes or soy milk.\n\nTip: go early to avoid long waits. Order the xiaomianwo."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOn2nP_tvVV2huw3EGHY6IfQZH9-0vJDxxF6ZtJ\u0026fid=0x0:0x108e07777597e207""],""When"":""2021-8-31""},{""Name"":""Helen Liu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKI-mzgGlleZ4ePt7mDYbQ4Gabh9zw-OBKk6bKlySQQQboerA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""ordered 猪脚饭 (pork feet rice) and 热干面 (hot dry noodles) and 2 Coca-Cola for $27, super fast service.

She ended going and getting the supervisor or the manager instead. They came over and I explained again. They told me that they couldn’t give me anything else because I “didn’t ask to sample it” (which doesn’t even make sense) but they can add water to my drink to make it less sweet. So I agreed to them adding more water. I take another sip after the water is added and it’s still overly sweet. It’s still undrinkable for my taste. I told them it’s still too sweet and they refused to do anything else for me. So I left the drink on the counter and walked out. I paid $7 for that drink and I’m just shocked they couldn’t just make me something else that was the same value. That was very poor customer service.

Loved the bread and the cheese combo. Doesn't get better than that. The other ones we tried all tasted similar to it.\n\nI would skip the beef wrap and the pizza and just stick with the pide cheese\n\nWe also tried the napoleon and it isn't your standard puff pastry napoleon. It wasn't crispy but it was still made with layered pastry and custard. Not my cup of tea\n\nOverall service was super friendly. Food wise it maybe just didn't suit us. I would say just try the pide cheese or the pide beef if you eat meat. Wouldn't make the trek out to this industrial area just to have it.

I always order my black coffee, its always fresh and balanced.  I frequently order some of the breakfast sandwiches, but my favorite is the breakfast bagel that has melted cheese together with bacon and egg and the chipotle sauce completes the flavour.  I've had the curry wrap as well.  I've always wanted to try the cheesecakes because they look appetizing but maybe next time.   I like that there are tons of choices from dessert to sandwiches.  I know that they are also fresh, not sitting in the food display for weeks. It becomes hard after a while.  Although the place is busy I've never seen a long line and I have always gotten my drink relatively quick.  The staff is friendly whenever I come.  This is my pet peeve whenever doing reviews.  I dedicate a star just for that purpose coming from the service industry myself. The ambient music is just right, unlike the Starbucks across the street blasting music you can’t have a conversation and there’s plenty of light coming in thru the huge glass windows.

This location, nestled within the Coppersmith Corner Shopping Centre, offers a diverse menu that caters to breakfast and lunch enthusiasts alike. Here’s a breakdown of my experience.\n\nService:\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted by a young hostess at the door. Unfortunately, her demeanor lacked the warmth and friendliness one expects from a welcoming staff, which set a somewhat disappointing tone initially. However, the experience took a positive turn when we were seated. Our waitress was notably accommodating, exuding friendliness and good humor throughout our meal. Her attentive service significantly enhanced our visit.\n\nRating : 9 out of 10\n\nFood:\n\n•\t10 Star Skillet with Egg:\nThis dish features a hearty combination of bacon, ham, sausages, frankfurters, bologna, spinach, green onions, tomatoes, onions, red and green peppers, and mushrooms, all topped with cheddar cheese. The portion was generous, and the ingredients complemented each other well, creating a balanced and flavorful dish. This skillet is a satisfying choice for those who enjoy a variety of breakfast meats and vegetables.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tHalloumi Chorizo Sausage:\nThe halloumi and chorizo were paired with spinach, black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, green onions, and a drizzle of hollandaise sauce. The saltiness of the halloumi and the bold flavors of the chorizo were well-matched, while the freshness of the spinach and the acidity of the tomatoes rounded out the dish. It was a well-executed offering that delivered on flavor.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tMorning Hot Dogs:\nThis dish consisted of frankfurters, bacon, and melted cheese rolled in crepes, accompanied by a side of potatoes. While the concept was interesting, the execution fell short. The flavors were decent but lacked the depth and distinctiveness that would make this dish stand out.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\n•\tElise Brioche:\nA standout dish, the Elise Brioche featured a brioche dipped in toast batter, served warm with a medley of strawberries, blueberries, and harvest crunch, garnished with English cream and cream cheese. The combination of flavors was delightful, with the freshness of the fruit pairing beautifully with the rich brioche and the lightness of the cream. This dish was a highlight and comes highly recommended.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nBeverages:\n\n•\tIced Cappuccino:\nUnfortunately, the iced cappuccino was underwhelming. It lacked the richness and depth of flavor expected from this beverage.\nRating: 6/10\n•\tRaspberry Pina Colada Smoothie:\nWhile the smoothie was enjoyable, it didn’t leave a lasting impression. The flavors were pleasant, but nothing extraordinary.\nRating: 6/10\n•\tBeet Cocktail:\nThe beet cocktail offered bold, earthy flavors that may appeal to those with a palate for more adventurous drinks. While it was a bit strong for my taste, I appreciated its distinctiveness.\nRating: 7/10\n\nAmbiance:\nThe restaurant boasts a clean, inviting environment that is both comfortable and welcoming. The atmosphere is well-suited for a casual meal, with a layout that allows for a pleasant dining experience.\n\nValue for Money:\nPricing at Cora is reasonable, particularly when considering the portion sizes and the freshness of the ingredients used. The restaurant offers good value for those seeking a substantial and flavorful breakfast or lunch.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nCora at Coppersmith Corner Shopping Centre delivers a solid dining experience with a variety of well-executed dishes. While there were minor setbacks, such as the initial greeting and some of the beverages, the quality of the food and the excellent service from our waitress make this location worth revisiting. I look forward to exploring more of their menu offerings in the future."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPFX3T06UYvzJ8z_7YAWPho7iDcXdNu0OjMPEYy\u0026fid=0x0:0x11f42c2117bd3ed9""],""When"":""2024-9-17""},{""Name"":""Lala"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWyqbE9FvKnSnD3GY4-us3_EnzbDGoj3ofAUCboC5L1JG3nQ7Y=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Eggs Benny- very yummy.

If you’ve got time to kill before your flight, you can just sit back, enjoy some freshly baked bread with a hot cup of coffee, and completely forget about the stress of traveling.\n\nThe prices are also surprisingly reasonable for airport food, and the quality is way better than you’d expect. Plus, the bread stays fresh for a while, so it’s perfect to snack on during the flight or even to bring home as a little gift for family or friends.\n\nIf you’re at the airport and need something tasty and convenient, this bakery is hands down the place to go.

There's a vegan sandwich and a few vegan baked goods. I think there might be a few baked goods that don't contain gluten, but this is probably not a safe place if you need true 100% gluten free because of cross contamination (nothing is packaged separately). They also have local soft drinks if you're not feeling coffee.\nThe baked goods are delicious and fresh, and I like that they have some less common flavours - nothing super out of the box, just more than the basics, which is especially a treat to see at an airport. If you've been to any of the Purebread bakeries in Vancouver the city, the selection here is just as expansive. Unlike the other Purebread bakeries, the sandwiches here are prepackaged and cannot be warmed up, but my veggie sandwich was just fine served cold.\nI know the airport is a different sort of employment situation than the rest of the city, but given my very positive experiences at other Purebreads, I was still surprised that the two employees here on my most recent visit were not very friendly. The barista that served me wasn't overtly rude, just kind of short with me, but the other one was snappish to another customer who was having trouble paying with their card.

It’s an open concept kitchen so you see everything.\n\nThe Milk Tea , is the most important part of a good HK Cafe even if it’s “fusion”. Have a look at the picture, I can tell from when they put down the milk tea that it was going to be bad. The color is so wrong, and tasted like watered down syrup tea. The lady at the water bar was clearly visible, and we saw her smelling a container of sugar or salt. lol… that shows a lot.\n\nThe Satay Beef Instant Noodle, again tasted like watered down satay beef , the more you eat it the more you don’t want to finish it. I think one of my photos show that I just stopped eating it.\n\nThe scrambled eggs was actually the only thing I can say is decent, but maybe it’s from that everything was just so bad….\n\nSo they ran out of ham and gave us sausages, and that was salty and not cooked like hk style.\n\nThen have a look at the “beef with shell pasta in tomato potato soup” , look at the effort in cutting that potato!!! lol…… really? The name should be changed to “beef with shell pastes in tomato and A QUARTER POTATO soup”..\n\nAs a true hker, and someone who actually enjoys hk milk and is hkers pride and joy, this milk tea was horrible and doesn’t reflect what hk milk tea is…\n\nWhat saved the service was one of the lady running the show. She knew what to say what to do.

The seasoning is well-balanced, allowing the earthy mushroom flavors to come through. However, it lacks the depth or richness that would elevate it beyond a basic offering. Its creamy texture and mild flavor make it a comforting choice, though it remains relatively simple without much complexity.\nRating: 7/10\n\nTomato Soup\nIKEA’s tomato soup provides a familiar and comforting flavor, with a well-seasoned base that balances the natural acidity and sweetness of the tomatoes. While enjoyable, the soup lacks distinctive characteristics—such as fresh herbs or additional seasoning layers—that would help it stand out from standard tomato soups. It serves as a reliable option for those seeking something light and traditional.\nRating: 7/10\n\nVegetable Medallions\nThe vegetable medallions, while offering a decent texture, fall short in flavor. They lack the seasoning necessary to make them truly enjoyable, resulting in a somewhat bland experience. While the dish is a healthy option, it could benefit greatly from a more inventive preparation or the inclusion of a dipping sauce to enhance its appeal.\nRating: 6/10\n\nPlant-Based Balls with Vegetables\nThe plant-based balls are hearty and filling, accompanied by a modest selection of vegetables. While the texture is commendable, the flavor is somewhat one-dimensional, leaving the dish feeling uninspired. A more robust seasoning or a dynamic sauce would significantly improve the overall experience. While suitable for those seeking plant-based options, it falls short of delivering a memorable meal.\nRating: 7/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe restaurant, located within IKEA, offers a casual and functional dining environment. The setup resembles a cafeteria-style experience, where customers line up with trays and select their meals from a counter—evoking memories of high school dining halls. Despite this, the space is large, clean, and cozy, with adequate seating. While the chairs are functional, they are not particularly comfortable for extended dining.\n\nPrice\nThe prices at IKEA Richmond Restaurant are undeniably affordable, which is one of its main draws. While the food selection is not top-tier, the low cost makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious diners. For the price, the overall value is reasonable.\n\nService\nThe service was adequate, though not particularly notable. It follows a self-service model, where diners order at the counter and receive their food. The staff was efficient, but the experience lacked any personalized attention.\n\n6 out 10\n\nVerdict\nIKEA Richmond Restaurant offers simple, no-frills dishes that cater to those looking for a quick, casual meal during a shopping trip. While the food is consistently decent, it lacks the creativity or bold flavors needed to elevate the dining experience. Ultimately, it’s a reliable option for convenience, but not a destination for culinary innovation."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNU7PHXXXsfMSLHGlzfydg9s-jQFhbvXML5_pUa\u0026fid=0x0:0xc8855e3befc7b661""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""eddy wong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8Fjpj3y8teHQ4LqbC4PHR8whbU4-XOrTXEwklI9bGRqZLRD20=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Sign up for a free family ikea membership.\nChoose any 3 entrees at 50% off.\n\nGo lineup.

of food items before my flight. Unfortunately, at around 8:30 pm, they had a limited selection of their market fresh sides. I had wanted to try their maple roasted root vegetables, but had to settle for their chicken dripping baby potatoes. A single portion was $7.95. The potatoes had a good roast, and the parsley \u0026 rosemary spices were strong. However, I wished it had a richer chicken taste from the drippings as the meaty/fatty flavour wasn't very noticeable. They had a small selection of To Live For Bakery products, so I purchased an Everyday Cookie (around $5.50). No issues!\n\nThe majority of the grab and go items list their ingredients, which is helpful for those with dietary restrictions! Pricing is as expected for airports (higher than off-site).

My girlfriend, her friend, and I initially tried to visit the Stanley Park Taphouse but were very disappointed. The atmosphere and service there did not meet our expectations, and we decided to look for a better option.\n\nOur decision turned out to be the best choice we made. We found Pacific Farm Market and were blown away by the experience. We ordered a delicious pizza, a couple of perfectly mixed Caesars, and an exquisite espresso martini. Each item was outstanding in its own right—the pizza was flavorful and cooked to perfection, the Caesars had just the right balance of spice and tang, and the espresso martini was a delightful mix of rich coffee and smooth alcohol.\n\nHowever, what truly made our visit memorable was the bartender. This wonderful gentleman had a fantastic personality and went above and beyond to make our stopover special. He was engaging, attentive, and clearly passionate about his craft. His recommendations were spot-on, and his friendly demeanor added a personal touch to our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, providing the perfect setting for us to unwind before our next flight. The combination of excellent food, well-crafted drinks, and outstanding service made this a five-star experience.\n\nIf you find yourself with some time to spare at Vancouver Airport, I highly recommend stopping by Pacific Farm Market for a meal and a drink.

The squid arrived hot, with a crisp exterior and well-balanced seasoning. The flavors were satisfying and memorable. 9/10\n\nCentury Egg and Shredded Salty Pork Congee:\n\nAmong the extensive congee offerings, I chose this variety. The congee was creamy and well-seasoned, with a generous amount of ingredients packed into a small bowl. The portion size was ideal for a light bite without being overly filling. 8/10\n\nAmbiance:\n\nThe seating was reasonably comfortable, though unremarkable. While the establishment was clean, there was an unpleasant odor lingering in the vicinity, which detracted from the overall experience. The source of the smell was unclear, but it did impact the ambiance. 5/10\n\nService:\n\nThe service was adequate, meeting expectations but offering nothing exceptional. It aligned with what one might anticipate from an establishment of this nature. 5/10\n\nPricing:\n\nThe pricing structure is mixed. While the congee was reasonably priced, the main dishes were slightly on the higher side. However, portion sizes were fair given the cost.\n\nDrink:\n\nIced Almond Milk:\n\nThe drink menu offers a wide selection, but I opted for the iced almond milk. It was refreshing and enjoyable. 7/10\n\nVerdict:\n\nI would consider returning, primarily due to the convenience of the 24/7 hours and the availability of parking.

The corned beef egg sandwich (鹹牛肉蛋治) is the best I’ve had in North America, comparable to those in Hong Kong. The bread was lightly toasted, and the scrambled egg was so fluffy and loaded with corned beef.\n\nHK style milk tea (港式奶茶) was rich and creamy. It came with a big glass so it justified the price.\n\nI was also craving for something hot and homey at midnight.

While some dishes were tasty, others felt salty and overcooked.\n\nOne positive aspect was the combo deal, which allows you to add $20 to your entree for a full-size appetizer and dessert.

The homemade touch was delightful and set a positive tone for the evening.\n\nSeafood and Corn Chowder\n\nThe chowder featured sea scallops, tiger prawns, fresh corn kernels, and cream. This was one of the best seafood and corn chowders I have ever tasted. The seasoning was impeccable, and the soup was rich and creamy. It unquestionably deserves a perfect score.\n\nRating: 10 out of 10\n\nAppetizers\n\n1.\tGrilled Jumbo Tiger Prawns with Corn Cakes\n\nThe tiger prawns were impeccably crispy and well-seasoned, providing a delightful start to the meal. The corn cakes added a wonderful texture and complemented the prawns perfectly.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10\n\n2.\tBaked Scallops with Lobster Sauce and Parmesan\n\nThis dish was undoubtedly a highlight of the evening. The scallops were baked to perfection and paired with a creamy, flavorful lobster sauce. The addition of Parmesan added a wonderful depth of flavor. It was an exquisite combination that I thoroughly enjoyed.\nRating: 10 out of 10\n\nMains\n\n1.\tSea Bass\n\nThe sea bass was expertly cooked and seasoned. It was juicy and flavorful, making for an exceptionally enjoyable dish. The presentation was also impressive, adding to the overall dining experience.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10\n\n2.\tRack of Lamb\n\nOrdered rare, the rack of lamb was substantial, juicy, and delicious. It was a standout dish that I relished. The accompanying sides were equally well-prepared, enhancing the overall dish.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nDesserts\n\n1.\tChocolate Soufflé\n\nThis dessert featured dark chocolate, brandy, and vanilla ice cream.

However, it was justified by the excellent dining experience. The value for money was evident in the quality of ingredients and the skillful preparation of each dish.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nTips\n\nIt is important to note that The Shoestring Cafe does not serve any special drinks such as wine or alcoholic beverages.\n\nVerdict\n\nDespite its modest size, The Shoestring Cafe excels in providing high-quality food and outstanding service.

We didn’t notice it as first because it’s tucked in the corner of the store.  The dining area has 3 tables that seat 4 each so a maximum of 12 people can hang out in the café at a time.  They have a beautifully lit backdrop on one side of the shop which really contributes to the cozy ambience.\n\nI’m not a big crêpe person so I ordered the cheesecake sundae instead.  Initially I thought it would just be cheesecake-flavoured ice cream with some oreo sprinkles.   I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order.  There was an actual slice of cheesecake in my sundae! The ice cream was rich, thick, and delicious.  It was not too sweet, which I loved.  They drizzled it with caramel syrup and the bottom of the cup was lined with a thick layer of crushed Oreos.  It’s the perfect dessert.  Simply delicious!\n\nApart from the top-notch dessert, what’s great about this café was the staff that worked there.  When we arrived, a lot of people were ordering desserts.  There was only one person behind the counter.  She was the one taking the orders and making them as well.  What amazed me was her demeanor and ability to multi-task.  She was pleasant to everyone who came to order, she always had a smile on her face, answered any questions customers had about their menu, and made sure patrons didn’t wait too long to order.  Once she was done receiving all the orders, she proceeded to make them all. She was fast and efficient but did not sacrifice quality at all.  The orders came beautifully presented and just as they appeared in the photos.  Her name is Zoe.  She’s an absolute gem and really adds value to that business.

And all the recommendations about what is good for kids, if they should have or shouldn't, appreciated it! The only thing that I think they should do is change the washroom lock, move it down more  because it's a bit too high for kids. And also difficult to unlock for kids. My daughters got stuck inside because it was difficult to unlock for them. Even me, I had a problem unlocking it. You have to put the door out to be able to unlock it so my friend put the door from outside for my kids to unlock the door. Anyway, we all had such a great time so thank you very much! Oh!

Although the place has limited seating, we were able to reserve a table in the tatami section which I recommend as it's quieter and aesthetically pleasing. We got seated quite quickly and they started us off with the tea. We found the tea to be too sweet and couldn't make it less sweet no matter how much water we added. The tea was a blend of a black tea with Korean honey Yuja cha from T\u0026T. Tasty but too sweet. All the savoury and sweet items arrived all at once. They were beautifully presented although some of the sweet items were beginning to melt when we got to them. We had 3 people and the amount of food was more than enough. The savoury items were better than your typical high tea sandwiches. I think 1 more savoury item would've balanced out the menu more. Our favourites were the unagi inari for the savoury item and the yogurt/ice cream parfait with cornflakes and brown sugar pearls for the sweet items as the different textures made it a fun experience to eat. Didn't care for the mochi Dango on a stick as it was too chewy and flavorless. We couldn't finish it all so we ended up packing some of the sweets to go. The service was friendly when we were able to get their attention but it was quite difficult as we were sitting at the back. The total for 3 people (3 sets) came to $120 which is good value for the price and experience. I would come again to try another set."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO1ASFIsSRBIY_apq-pZl6MyLWsf507CW-F1SLM\u0026fid=0x0:0x5cf0fb3964ec903""],""When"":""2024-10-14""},{""Name"":""Sinyo ganteng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVK6DhObLW3StVcJ_e9Ph42mdmAq5cSoW-d536hao-jSu7WAn8I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""One of the best  Japanese matcha, from their cakes to their drinks are made for perfection.

Also tried their Shanghai Fried Noodles with chicken. Delicious! And the price was great too. By the time we were done, more people came in and tables filled up. Felt bessed  finding this place. It's a keeper for sure.\n\nUpdate: I eat here every other week but lately the lady at the till is beginning to annoy me. I usually order my food, eat it then leave a cash tip on the table. Every time I pay upfront, she notices there's no tip and she makes a big fuss over it. She is so rude asking for the tip! On my last trip, I gave her 10% only because she expected it. If she wasn't so rude, I would have tip more. On top of that, I've been there so many times and left a tip that she would give me some slack but no. I'm just another customer to her.

If you love matcha, you will love this place. Their soft serve is delicious, although my favourite item is the Maiko special as it's a decadent treat with lots of ingredients inside and soft serve on top. They occasionally change up soft serve flavours as well, so I've loved the hojicha, ube, and yuzu flavours in addition to the usual matcha.\n\nService is pretty quick and smooth. The atmosphere is lovely as well, very warm. My only issue is that there's hardly any tables/seating inside, so if it's full you have to wait or go outside. In the summer/warmer months it's a great option to visit the playground/park outside the Richmond public market, but not so in the colder months.\n\nShoutout as well to Bryan who helped me figure out the new rewards system.

I ordered the fully loaded cilantro chicken wrap. I have ordered this many times before at this location and other locations. The cost was $7.79 + tax = $8.18 as you can see in my screen shot from my debit transaction.  I was on my lunch break. I stood on the side waiting to pick up my order like other customers. My wrap was ready and I grabbed it, even said thank you and  off I went to my car. As I sat in my car I opened the wrap to take my first bite like I always do. Then I realize today's wrap is totally off size!! But I was on my break and was in a rush back to work (cause to have to clock back in) so I didn't bother going back inside with a long line (lunch rush) I took my first bite and had to take another picture of my wrap. I kept shaking my head saying, \""there is NO WAY this wrap I ordered should be under 4\""!\"" Then I took few more bites and my wrap was finished. I got back to work and told my manager and colleagues. Everyone said why didn't I go complain. Told them I'm on my break on the clock. So my manager approved me to go back and complain. Shortly after I went back. Waited patiently for a staff to greet me and i nicely and calmly asked to speak to their manager. I greeted the manager and she greeted me. I asked her what is the size of your cilantro chicken wrap. Tim Hortons manager replied, \""our wrap comes in at 10\"". When it's folded it becomes about 6\"". I said ok sounds fair and I understand. I then showed her my photo of the cilantro chicken wrap from earlier. As she was looking at the photo I asked her \""does this look like 6\"" ???\"" I then said it's like 4\"". She then said, \""sometimes our wrap comes in smaller size.\"" She never apologized. She never offered to remake a new wrap or refund. She then asked me,\"" how did it taste?\"" I'm shaking my head and said, \""taste the same like always but that's not the point here.\"" She then said, \""thank you for showing us this and I will let my staff know to wrap it better next time.\"" I'm standing there still shaking my head?!!!!! And just walked off. This manager obviously thought nothing was wrong. Didn't care to apologize or remake me a wrap. This is unacceptable!! $8.18 for 3.5 bites of this 10\"" wrap or 6\"" wrap. Here are some pictures from today compared to what Tim\nHortons advertised. You be the judge for yourself. She said it becomes 6\"". Ok fine I respect that.

We kept on waiting for my name to be called but nobody did which made me decide to come to the mobile pick up. There I found my order , coffee getting cold and no one bothered asking me even if I was already standing by the Mobile Pick up. I will be forgiving if it was crazy busy but it wasn't and staff were just chit chatting. Today, went straight to mobile pick up because I'm not sure if the staff will call me. Waited patiently and saw my order being prepared. (The counter order which i think I was about 5min ahead since I placed my mobile order was served ahead of me) I was standing there waiting for the staff up call or ask me but my order was just placed down and was left beside the machine. So I need to ask if that order is for me which was definitely mine. Had I not asked even if I'm standing there for the next 30min or an hour nobody will bother asking if I'm waiting for my order etc. So different with RC which I think is way busier that this location.

Most of them seemed to be made from frozen foods. My fries were soggy and cold. My wife’s chicken on the salad was hard and dry. My kids left most of their meal because of the taste.

Intrigued by the buzz, we decided to visit Tandoori King Kitchen \u0026 Bar the following day.\n\nAmbiance: Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed by the waitress. The interior was inviting, with a cozy and intimate atmosphere that set the stage for a pleasant dining experience. The decor was tastefully done, reflecting traditional Indian aesthetics with a modern touch.\n\nFood:\n\nAppetizer\n\nPrawn Pakora\nMarinated in yogurt, ginger, and garlic, the prawn pakora was a delightful start to our meal. The prawns were large and perfectly crispy, with a well-balanced seasoning that enhanced their natural flavor. This dish was an excellent introduction to the restaurant’s culinary prowess.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nMains\n\nButter Chicken\nThe butter chicken featured boneless chicken pieces cooked in a rich butter sauce infused with ginger and garlic. The portion size was generous, making it good value for money. The chicken was tender and succulent, with a well-rounded seasoning that made the dish thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10\n\nLamb Korma\nThe lamb korma, cooked in a creamy cashew nut sauce, presented large, tender pieces of lamb. While the portion size was generous, the dish fell slightly short on seasoning, making it a bit bland for my taste. However, the quality of the lamb was commendable.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nService: Despite a minor hiccup with my drink order, the waitress was courteous and apologetic. Given the busy evening and the limited staff on the floor, the service was efficient and friendly.\n\nPrice: The meal offered excellent value for money, with generous portions and reasonable pricing.\n\nVerdict: Tandoori King Kitchen \u0026 Bar is a promising addition to the Richmond dining scene. The ambiance is charming, the food is generally impressive, and the prices are fair. Despite a few minor issues, our overall experience was positive, and we look forward to returning.

Honestly, even sharing a plate got us completely full and the food tasted amazing as well. My favorite dish was the Milano sauce with Fettuccini pasta. I think their price is reasonable, but I agree is a little expensive if you order stuffed pasta like gnocchi, which they charge an extra $5. We also shared a brownie with 4 scoops of ice cream ($12) and it was delicious. I like that they play italian songs in the restaurant and the servers and hosts were nice as well. I would recommend this place if you want to share a meal with a friend, I think it's more worth it to share with someone than to take it home later. The price varies a lot so it depends what you wanna eat. For example, one person paid $16 at the end (sharing a plate, no drinks), and another person paid around $60 (full size plate, one glass of wine, extra for gnocchi)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMNZtnGQJaUFEd2_Q_1F_jCSBPIiPYTLUaAUGY\u0026fid=0x0:0xe2ff4289a54c73de""],""When"":""2024-10-28""},{""Name"":""Jello Candles"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLHi7A-Ad-UZ-ihIVsJVirYVG_GwBefu03JiYiQDIqXUu231g=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Pasta was excellent!!

Highly recommend.\n\nDine-in area is small and limited. Three tables only suitable for 2 person/couple, and the others are individual high chairs. If weather is good, they will set up extra table outside.\n\nI'm the person who always fast to spot the cleanlines. Dine-in area and kitchen (where they stand behind the counter) are clean. The restroom is smells fresh and clean except the toilet bowl. I spotted the surface of toilet bowl didn't fully clean. I hope the management take note of this highlight.\n\nAnother friendly suggestion or reminder, Diplomat Bakery should have active on Instagram and allowed customer tag their pictures and videos, and repost it.

I first learnt about it more than 12 years ago when a friend had a cake that was shaped into a book at a party. The book was made of a triple chocolate mousse cake.  Ever since then I have been returning to the Diplomat Bakery every time I need a cake. Their prices are very reasonable and the quality of their cakes is excellent. The triple chocolate mousse cake is my absolute favourite and every time I serve it, people are always raving about it. I don’t live in Richmond, but I will travel the 40 minutes to get there just for this cake. The staff is always friendly and there’s always people getting coffee and mingling around the bakery. It’s located in a nice little tucked away spot in Steveston. The parking is easy as there is paid street parking but also there’s free underground parking behind the building. That’s where I usually go. Not really sure if I should be parking there but I do! Staff is always friendly. The place is very clean and organized. It’s a great place to go for cakes for special occasions as well as just having coffee and a treat with friends, to take a break or just because it’s so good!  I think the Diplomat Bakery should give me a free treat for this review😀 But honestly, I highly recommend it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNwt9ShNtk3yGs4aHlR59-Kxb7xY2rsnyUIo3oz\u0026fid=0x0:0x4a6fd7152c76bc64""],""When"":""2024-8-20""},{""Name"":""A A"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW_yls-c9aHmykcfQ2h9FniTZl8rGh46VKtnyP5sbH1xa_u7ghP=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Diplomat Bakery is my \""go-to\"" place for cakes and pastries.\nThis time, I got a couple of donuts and a cupcake.

There aren't many places where you can walk in and buy a cake and have them personalize it right then and there without a pre-order, it's a wonderful service. The other reason I'm writing this is put my strong opinion in that the red velvet cake donuts are absolutely the best thing ever! Another reviewer wrote they didn't like them that it should be more of a donut, but it literally says cake donut, it's a cake in the shape of a donut and the cream cheese frosting is out of this world.

I remembered clearly at the time of ordering to check for their closing hours to be sure that I can pick it up on time and that they weren't closing early for X'mas (both the Google hours and their main website said at the time of ordering that their store closes at 7 pm/ regular hours so I proceeded with ordering).\nWhen I got to the Richmond store on Dec 24th at 4:15 pm, I then realized from the sign posted outside their door that they actually closed at 4 pm. I want to thank the staff that they still opened the doors after hours when I knocked, thank you to one of the ladies who called her manager to let her know about the situation and thankfully, in the end, I was able to still pick up the order but I want to raise a few concerns here:\n1) I would not have ordered from Paragon if I knew ahead of time that they were closing early or I would have arranged someone to pick up for me. I have done my due diligence to check for their holiday hours on the day of placing the order. Their holiday hours should have been posted on their main website given that they have an online ordering system on this site and they have order pick up available on xmas Eve (even until today, Dec 24th, the holiday hours aren't posted). The hours on google were not updated until the day of. The receipt also does not indicate pick up deadline. I raised this concern to the staff at pickup that their hours aren't updated and her response was that this is posted on Instagram. There shouldn't be an assumption that all their customers follow  their Instagram or that their go-to would be to check Instagram for their hours, especially when there is a store website and the Instagram account is not the first link that is attached the Google business page. I could not find a phone number to call either to give them a heads up or inquire what to do in this case.\n2) It would be appreciative if the staff could have called the customers who did not pick up their orders (or even called 30 min before closing which some other stores would have done) or sent an email regarding this which will highlight more professionalism here. When asked about this, the staff answered that they have too many orders to call the customers (which is interesting because do they have many orders left behind by customers who do not pick up their order for the day they ordered for).\nIn summary, I still want to thank the staff for taking their time for helping me but I hope the store understands the frustration for a customer who is trying to rush from work and hoping to gift the cookies for an X'mas dinner. This could be handled with better customer service and professionalism."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPp2nBWzmJi7dbcF5UHsZFQaWmDwVsqNjavRLr3\u0026fid=0x0:0x2a1f74f49a19358d""],""When"":""2024-12-25""}]",

While the seating was comfortable, the choice of background music and television programming seemed more tailored to local tastes, which may feel somewhat isolating for non-Chinese-speaking guests. This lack of inclusivity in the entertainment detracted from the overall dining atmosphere.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nFood:\n\nTom Yum Goong Seafood Hotpot with Rice\nThe Tom Yum Goong seafood hotpot was the highlight of the meal. The portion was generous, with a plentiful variety of seafood, including fish, shrimp, mussels, and fresh vegetables. The broth offered a well-balanced flavor, though it fell short of the punchy, spicy kick that typically defines this dish. A touch more heat would have elevated it to a more authentic Tom Yum experience. Nevertheless, the dish stands out as a solid choice for seafood lovers.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nFried Intestines\n\nThe fried intestines were an unexpected delight. Expertly fried to a crisp, they offered a satisfying texture and depth of flavor. Paired with a garlic soy dipping sauce, the dish was well-executed and is highly recommended for those seeking a unique starter.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nDrink:\n\nI opted for the taro slush, which unfortunately did not meet expectations. While the flavor was adequate, the texture was inconsistent, with ice chunks present throughout, marring the smoothness that a quality slush should provide. The drink could benefit from better preparation to achieve the expected level of refinement.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nService:\n\nThe service was the most significant area in need of improvement. Given the nature of the restaurant, my expectations were moderate, but the staff’s attentiveness was lacking. Additionally, communication was difficult for non-Chinese-speaking customers, which could be an obstacle for many diners. Greater attention to service and accommodating all guests would significantly enhance the overall experience.\n\nRating: 2/10\n\nPrice:\n\nThe pricing was fair, especially considering the portion sizes and quality of the dishes. It offers good value for those looking to enjoy a variety of flavorful options without overspending.\n\nVerdict:\n\nSuper Stars Cafe has potential, particularly with its food offerings, which are well-executed and reasonably priced. However, the experience was somewhat marred by the ambiance and service, which both require attention to cater to a broader clientele. The restaurant only accepts cash, and parking can be a challenge during peak hours, so plan accordingly. Despite these drawbacks, I would return to explore other items on their menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMCqMo_AmYOxKlMXPUQgJXonjcJO1zs0L_2Rqui\u0026fid=0x0:0x849f064f95af4389""],""When"":""2024-9-18""},{""Name"":""JENN WOO"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXvIJPgN4NR4GqFDWwcS6beS_JkwzhP97OBJCKBMgCo_hhFdb4d=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""One star is also dont want to give to this restaurant.\nService is so bad, also food is worst ever i had in Vancouver.\nAlso they only take cash(i dont know why permitted restaurant only get cash), and we didnt know they only get cash so we try to etransfer but they treated us like very annoying.

The ingredients were fresh, and the flavors were well-balanced. Whether you're there for breakfast, lunch, or just a snack, Blue Duck Café does not disappoint. The coffee is top-notch too—smooth, rich, and exactly what you need to start your day or power through your afternoon.\n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. They made sure everything was just right without being overbearing, and they were quick to offer recommendations when asked. It’s clear that they genuinely care about providing a great experience for their customers.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and service. It’s a great value for such a lovely experience. The café has a laid-back, yet trendy vibe, which makes it a great spot to meet up with friends or get some work done.\n\nOverall, I can’t recommend Blue Duck Café enough!

sushi at Tsukiji, while decent, did not quite live up to the standards set by other Japanese sushi houses I've visited. The flavors were somewhat lacking in depth, and the freshness of the ingredients was not as pronounced as I had hoped. The selection was adequate, but it didn't offer the wow factor that I was looking for in a sushi dining experience.\n\nThe service at Tsukiji was average, neither exceptionally good nor bad. The staff were polite and attentive, but there wasn't a sense of warmth or personalized attention that can elevate a dining experience from ordinary to special. The efficiency of the service was commendable, but it lacked the personal touch that can make a restaurant stand out.\n\nOverall, I would rate my experience at Tsukiji Japanese Restaurant as a 5 out of 10. While it provides a satisfactory dining experience, it doesn't quite hit the mark in terms of the exceptional food quality and service that I seek in a Japanese sushi restaurant. It's a decent option for a casual meal, but it may not satisfy those looking for an authentic and outstanding sushi experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPuHI4KH6-5Kmn-tvB0PrlaLSZxSlRF6qMsGU-3\u0026fid=0x0:0xeb752bef8d1328b8""],""When"":""2024-2-20""},{""Name"":""Thedishdetective Lala"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKD_tj6k6xpF8R8uVmPtHQuGBgjvefVOKaKmqeE1mkWnmvdyA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Tsukiji Japanese Restaurant\n\nLocation: 4751 Garden City Rd, Richmond, BC V6X 3M7\n\nWe decided to visit Tsukiji Japanese Restaurant for a quick bite and were pleasantly surprised by the experience.\n\nAppetizer: Chopped Scallop with Tobiko and Mayo\n\nWe started with the chopped scallop mixed with tobiko and mayo, which proved to be an exceptional appetizer. The flavors were well-balanced, and the dish had a delightful texture. The only minor suggestion would be to increase the amount of dried seaweed on the side to enhance the presentation and add an extra layer of flavor.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10\n\nMain Courses:\n\nBeef Don\n\nThe Beef Don was a standout dish, featuring thinly sliced beef simmered with tender onions in a savory-sweet sauce. The seasoning was impeccable, and the beef was cooked to perfection, making it a truly satisfying meal.\n\nUnagi Don\n\nThe Unagi Don was another highlight, consisting of steamed white rice topped with grilled eel fillets. The eel was well-cooked, maintaining a good meat-to-skin ratio, and was enhanced by a sweet soy-based marinade. While the dish was enjoyable, I have experienced more flavorful versions at other Japanese restaurants.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nAmbiance: The ambiance was acceptable but a bit loud for a relaxing dining experience. The decor was simple and functional, fitting the restaurant’s casual dining theme.\n\nService: The service was prompt and generally efficient, though slightly unorganized. Multiple servers attended to our table, resulting in instances where our teacups were filled while still full. Additionally, the staff spoke to us in their native language, which could be confusing for some patrons. However, their overall attentiveness and friendliness were appreciated.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nPrice: The pricing of the dishes we tried was reasonable. However, we did not sample the higher-priced items on the menu, so we cannot comment on the value of those options.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWe would definitely consider returning to Tsukiji Japanese Restaurant, as there are many other dishes we are eager to try. The overall dining experience was pleasant, with a few minor areas for improvement.\n\nAdvice: When driving, don’t forget to register your car plate number to the greeter  inside the restaurant when parking to avoid any inconvenience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOizELin-ek5LKjIEnKUFBdtSy_yJjCShYIp_0w\u0026fid=0x0:0xeb752bef8d1328b8""],""When"":""2024-7-19""},{""Name"":""Kristy Chen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWEfZ2rjxNiODjhooQ3vu4wU52UFmMssx1nBEw-QrGtiP3D8nPb=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Restaurant is mediocre in terms of skill and rolls, I found that the sushi rolls were below average.

While the team were attentive, the food missed the mark. The clam chowder tasted like cream sauce with some vegetable and clams mixed in, no flavour or depth. Lobster croissant presentation looked great, but the flavour didn't really come together. More like a seafood mixture with some nice garnish. Chicken and waffle was the lone bright spot. While it's named a seafood restaurant, I believe the menu is a bit one dimensional and more choices can be added. Finally, the critique does not take a way all the great work the team has done.

On this visit, we were a party of three adults and a toddler, to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary. Having dined here before with a larger group in the intimacy of a private room, I was eager to see if the experience would be as outstanding as our first visit—and it absolutely was.\n\nLittle Karp masterfully blends the vibrant flavors of Asian and West Coast cuisine, using only the freshest seafood and local ingredients, many of which are sourced daily from the nearby fishing village of Steveston. This isn't your typical Asian restaurant; the kitchen at Little Karp crafts an exquisite fusion that takes your taste buds on a journey, elevating every dish into a memorable experience.\n\nAlthough the entrées are designed for individual servings, we chose to share our plates, creating a delightful communal meal.\n\nOur evening began with the Nova Scotia Lobster Ceviche, a refreshing medley of lobster meat, cilantro, habanero peppers, mango, cucumber, shallots, and chives, paired perfectly with their Garlic Cheese Bread (quickly consumed by our 3 year old granddaughter).   Next came the Clam Chowder—an unforgettable dish made with white fermented soy bean curd, fresh clams, and fennel, its flavors both comforting and intriguing.\n\nOur mains included a beautifully executed Wild Mushroom Risotto and the standout Hainanese Chicken Rice, which was nothing short of exceptional, accompanied by a side of perfectly seared Scallops.\n\nWhen reserving our table, I mentioned our special occasion, and to our delight, the evening was capped off with a complimentary chocolate ganache, adorned with whipped cream, strawberries, and blueberries—a sweet and thoughtful gesture from the restaurant.\n\nAs I observed the dishes being served at other tables—Wagyu burgers, fish fillet, fish and chips, filet mignon, seafood paella, and succulent crabs—I couldn't help but make a mental note to return and explore more of their diverse offerings.\n\nFor those who appreciate Asian cuisine, the innovative blend of spices and techniques with Western and European influences at Little Karp is truly something special. The impeccable service, delivered by a team of professionals, only adds to the overall experience. This is a place you simply must try—it promises not to disappoint."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNjYTUcIW9XwjK_xjctHSe4Gv5bYFSMfzXyLGPy\u0026fid=0x0:0x873cd22b28d4ccaa""],""When"":""2024-8-26""}]",

Cosmo Plaza, 8788 McKim Way #1205, Richmond, BC V6X 4E2\n\nDining at Garden City Hot Pot offers a straightforward and satisfying hot pot experience, with a selection of well-executed broths and fresh ingredients. For our dinner, we decided to explore two separate soup bases—parsley and preserved egg for my friend, and homemade satay for myself.\n\nFood\n\nHomemade Satay Soup\nThe homemade satay soup was a highlight of the meal, delivering a robust and flavorful base. The broth was rich without being overly salty, offering a good depth of flavor that worked well with the various meats and vegetables we added. Its seasoning was balanced, making it a versatile foundation for the hot pot experience.\nRating: 8/10\n\nFatty Beef Slices, Beef Tongue, Meatball Combo, Spinach, Chinese Mushrooms\nThe quality of the ingredients was consistently high. The fatty beef slices were tender and well-marbled, offering a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The beef tongue provided a nice textural contrast, and the meatball combo added variety to the protein selection.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nShandong Noodles\n\nThe Shandong noodles were a standout, thanks to their perfect texture. With a firm yet smooth bite, they held up well in the broth and added a satisfying element to the meal. They absorbed the rich flavors of the soup while maintaining their integrity, making them an excellent accompaniment.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nDeluxe Sashimi Platter\nUnfortunately, the deluxe sashimi platter was underwhelming. While the presentation was acceptable, the portion sizes and quality of the fish did not justify its name or price. The cuts were smaller than expected and lacked the freshness and vibrancy one would anticipate from a sashimi platter at a dedicated hot pot restaurant. It felt more akin to pre-packaged sushi than a premium offering.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nService\nThe service at Garden City Hot Pot was generally good, though not remarkable. The staff were courteous and attentive, ensuring that our hot pot experience proceeded smoothly. However, there was nothing particularly noteworthy about the service—while competent, it did not stand out as exceptional.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nAmbiance\nThe restaurant is clean, comfortable, and well-suited for a casual dining experience. The decor is simple, and the seating is comfortable, providing a relaxed atmosphere without the noise or bustle often associated with hot pot establishments. It’s a pleasant environment for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings, though it lacks any distinctive character that would make it memorable.\nRating: 8/10\n\nPrice\n\nPricing is reasonable for the quality and portion sizes offered. While some dishes, like the sashimi platter, feel overpriced for what they deliver, the majority of the menu offers good value, particularly the hot pot ingredients and broth selections.\n\nVerdict\n\nGarden City Hot Pot is a solid choice for hot pot enthusiasts seeking a reliable and enjoyable meal. The homemade satay soup and the quality of the ingredients make it a worthwhile visit. However, certain menu items, such as the sashimi platter, leave room for improvement. While it may not be a destination for those seeking a truly elevated dining experience, it delivers well on the essentials and is certainly worth a return visit to explore more of the menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMkwDrM4JqcVpTwAFZdHnfSYlR0PgcMoteGX7qW\u0026fid=0x0:0x3db777204510de14""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""Sinyo ganteng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVK6DhObLW3StVcJ_e9Ph42mdmAq5cSoW-d536hao-jSu7WAn8I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Food is okay, order hotpot and few dimsum. hotpot soup order sukoyaki mushroom, very tasty, meat was bit hard.  siomay is so tasteless. deepfried taro with scallops is very good.

We were intrigued because you don't normally find dim sum at a hot pot place.\n\nFirst of all, the complex this place is in seems a bit sketch (or at least it's seen better days). Once you get inside the restaurant tho' it's not bad. You order from a tablet and you can get both dim sum and other items.\n\nWe started with the braised oyster hot pot. We don't find this at many restaurants any more. The oysters seemed to have a bit of a pan-fried fried texture to the coating and the oysters were accompanied with slices of liver.\n\nFor the dim sum items, they generally came out to about $9/$10 per dish. The deep fried taro and scallop dumplings had a creamy filling. The scallop itself wasn't great but the taro to filling ratio was spot on.\n\nThe shrimp spring rolls had a layer of seaweed on the inside of the wrapper and turned out crispy. The chiu chow dumplings had a thinnish wrapper encasing the pork/shrimp and peanut filling and turned out nicely.\n\nThe honeycomb tripe was fairly good although some pieces were slightly chewier. Meanwhile the steamed tofu skin wraps were quite large and saucy.\n\nOverall, pleasantly surprised at the dim sum options at this hot pot place and will have to come back to check out the rest of their dishes.\n\nUpdate: Returned in December for dim sum. They had a discount for cash payment (think it was 20%)\n\nUpdate: Late March 2024... finally came back to try out their hot pot menu. I like that you can either get a large hot pot or smaller individual pots. We wound up ordering the sukiyaki and pork bone broth.\n\nThey had a special where you can get a dish of grass carp slices for $0.01 if you post an insta story. I was surprised at how large the grass carp dish was. While some of the pieces had some fish skin on that was a bit chewy, it was otherwise a good dish.\n\nAlso got the veggie platter, fatty beef slices, meat ball combo, dumplings, and udon noodles.\n\nIt was a bit much for us to finish because the serving sizes are large. It would probably be better if you come with a larger party. We were quite full afterwards and had to take some home. Overall, good quality hot pot. Next time we plan to do one hot pot and add some dim sum dishes."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOjxkHGg54ddz4VqbiFq6tfDeQi-3kQKQixrMj2\u0026fid=0x0:0x3db777204510de14""],""When"":""2023-11-22""},{""Name"":""Yolanda D"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLFx_59UN-u-qBUQeZeAmjyb4s7zOtkGAvBUrf6f0OniiuKSQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The best seafoods porridge hot pot I've ever had!

We ordered the Bite of Everything, Spicy Agedashi Tofu and King Dragon Roll. This was more than enough for 2 people with some leftovers to take home.\n\nMost people seemed to order their bento box (dinner special), so of course we had to try a Bite of Everything. This is definitely a good sampler to try a variety of items from their menu. I’d say the nigiri was quite standard and basic. Didn’t feel the fish was amazingly fresh or anything. Infact most of the bento box was quite basic, it’s more catered to getting a sampler over quality. I’d say my favourite item was probably the tuna carpaccio and chicken karaage, it fried well and juicy. The Spicy Agedashi Tofu could’ve been spicier - I didn’t taste much spice, although it was fried nicely. I’d say my favourite thing hands down was the King Dragon Roll. It’s like a dragon roll, but so much better. The soft shell crab was fried nicely and texture, flavour, looks was all on point. If you’re looking for a roll here, get that one - you won’t regret it!\n\nOverall, I feel it’s a bit overpriced for the quality. I prefer higher quality, smaller portions while this is more quantity over quality. Besides the King Dragon Roll, there was nothing that stood out much to me. I left feeling pretty average so it’s not a place I’d go out of my way to. I feel there’s definitely better places with better value."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOvDSK3YX8nmpgeBIZrAjZ_rWHBXcTtGQgLNK86\u0026fid=0x0:0x108d65e092af93fc""],""When"":""2024-9-5""},{""Name"":""Anne H"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLOtJObZEuqS-_AGcDV08LHiNOH1vlSXl2nqoJyyUVDcWm1p_A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had lunch here.

try this place and have seen good to great reviews. Parking is free for 3 hours by registering your vehicle at the restaurant. A great start! The private room we were in had us 12 adults and a toddler tightly squeezed around a table with two built-in hotplates. We had to ask for more chairs and cutlery even though a reservation was made and numbers were confirmed at the entrance. I didn’t think the regular menu was great (except for the price); there seemed to be a lot more choices in the premium one. Everything started to taste the same to me because the broths were so strong after a while. Our fault for dumping everything in all at once… The meat rings were a nice presentation touch, but there wasn’t room on the table for much more after they came. Overall, it would have been better to dine with a max of 4 pp so the food could be added into the pots more slowly for optimal savouring. We’ll have to give this place another try, especially with the premium menu. There were ice cream sandwiches and sea salt mints at the end. The mints were awesome! The service was a bit slow; we had to add for more broth, napkins, etc. The sauce / dessert bar was crowed with people and needed some cleaning up. I didn’t get to try much of it.

Double soup base (spicy \u0026 pork bone broth). Pretty basic and standard.\n2. Sauce bar was pretty standard.\n3. Self serve appetizer bar. A dozen selection of cooked and cold appetizers . Plus a plate of chicken bones eaten by someone sitting there on the counter, do people actual act like animals in a public setting? (Rolleyes).\n4. Pork blood, quail eggs, frozen tofu, Chinese donut stuffed shrimp paste, selection of vegetables, bamboo piths, spam, tofu skin, enoki mushrooms. All pretty basic.\n5. Clams and scallops. Clams were small and scallops were a bit too thinly sliced.\n6. Sliced lamb and Wagyu beef plate. The lamb slices were okay but the wagyu beef was… ummm.. it certainly didn’t have that tender buttery taste to it and as you know I eat a lot of wagyu beef.\n7. Salmon, red tuna, hokkigai sashimi. The salmon was okay, a bit dry. The hokkigais were a bit slimy at one end and as for the red tuna, it was like eating a sponge soaked in water. (The quality could create an outbreak of food poisoning so the restaurant knows.. Facepalm). The wasabi was a paste from a supermarket squeeze tube. Ordered another round to confirm the quality but it never came! So pretty much paid $34 extra for a few small pieces of bad quality sashimi.\n\nThe service here was pretty generic but they sure bring the food out slowwwwww and they will also tell you that it takes a bit longer to prepare the sashimi?!?! (Yeah expect more than 35+mins wait for an order of sashimi and most likely you will get one round of it during the duration of your meal).\n\nThe food quality was pretty basic to below average eg. sashimi, beef, seafood. Therefore maybe it’s best to opt out of the premium and stick with the basic AYCE instead if you want to try this place out.\n\nOverall, it’s really a disappointing experience. You can rest assure that the experience will be nothing like how those so called foodies market it on social media. (Don’t know why I even believe those who twirl their beef on their chopsticks to begin with.. clowns).  I would say for a much better experience for a lower or similar price would be Marble Eatery, Cho Cho, Happy Lamb hotpot.\n\nIn conclusion there’s a Chinese saying, “if you open your door for business, do it properly not half azz it” Literally this place gave the impression of half azz’ing it by its delay and long wait time for the food to come out.  It really became an All You Can’t Eat!\n\nAn AYCE failed! No repeat or recommended.\n\nThumbs down 👎"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP9DCd22o6dY48ZFeryCODWOW2I-4x54JJIOQ0o\u0026fid=0x0:0x5c055ec6db84add0""],""When"":""2024-11-12""},{""Name"":""CL"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJEOodGjHk-7O4UQKg3jyAyeHD7p5mB9pYh7Meku93t9eyaqA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Our go to ayce hotpot spot!

It’s the perfect complement to your meal.\n\nDessert: Naughty Natas\nSimilar to Portuguese egg tart - Flaky crust filled with custard and caramel — sweet!\n\nBeverages: Sangria\nRefreshing and just right for a summer evening.\n\nLoved their spacious indoor area and the beautiful outdoor patio with brick and greenery—perfect for summer hangouts!\n\nI left with a bottle of XX Hot Piquante sauce, ready for some grilling adventures.\n\nBig thanks to Nerissa and Nando's Canada for a fun and delicious night. 🎉 And shoutout to our amazing Yelp Community Manager, Anushka, for organizing such a fantastic event! 👏✨\n\n[Yelp Elite Event]"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN4ZgxiOjey3ZCImnpcjxWaITGWeX0Db5L1TpZf\u0026fid=0x0:0x8f5a3709cede8538""],""When"":""2024-6-30""},{""Name"":""Laba Group"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWKBffkXjyVpQ9hNDSIdczYqzHUSaC3cBZjTa55QNrNt8_IIIuw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Angel Makes This Nando’s Exceptional!\n\nMy family and I travel to this Nando’s location not just for the food, but for the exceptional service we’ve always received from the local staff—and especially from Angel.

Then the second bowl, broth tatsted much better, but the beef sliced was tough and chewy, the bone marrow (probably not cooked long enought, still very jello like, and the noodles were mushy and clumped together...i told the server again and  asked for no replacement.\n\nAlso the snack (mini spring roll) was surprisingly MINI, teh dipping sauce tastes very sweet.\n\nPartner ordered chicken leg and fried egg rice. The chicken leg was super dry and flavorless, as if it had been fried into oblivion before being thrown onto the plate...\n\nEnvironment was ok, the interior is stuffed with many decorations, making the space seemed small. Also they have a few type of dining chairs in the restaurant, some are shorter than others, making a weired height with the table. Also, I dont really like their chopsticks, its made of wood and probably been used for a while, the wood starts to flake out. Just dont like to imagine that it been soaked in many bowls of pho, in people's mouth and soap many times...\n\nFinally let's not forget about the prices!! They charges PREMIUM prices for what can only be described as subpar fare. And not to mention they set their credit card machines minimum tip percentage 18%, though their food, service, and environment of this dining experience is far below what they thought they deserve.\n\nIn conclusion, it is definitely an unforgettable experience that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

I can’t tell).\n\nBBQ Beef Short Rib ($32.95) – How is this so TENDER?! Huge portion too, it’s at least 3 large strips. Marinated thoroughly and comes on a sizzling plate. 10/10 would order again, great price too.\n\nHoney Butter Fried Chicken ($13.95) – Wish it was crispier, BUT flavour was 10/10. You can really taste the strong garlic flavour. Came with 3 rice cakes too which was cute, a nice chewy break.\n\nCold Noodle w/ Soup ($16.95) – I’m usually not a fan of cold noodle honestly, this was actually amazing and changed my mind permanently about cold noodles. It’s not just a boring vinegar sauce, it has a robust flavour with sweetness. Super refreshing for the summer (or anytime really).\n\nService is very friendly, but they're also super busy so you'll have to grab their attention if you want anything. There's a lot of large seating at the back, so it's good for larger parties/family gatherings, but I'd probably recommend a reservation for sure.

So, when I saw Tang Vietnamese Restaurant in Richmond being promoted by many foodies on Instagram, I decided to try it out when I had the chance to be in Richmond. Today was the day.\nThe restaurant has a spacious outdoor and indoor dining area. We arrived around 12:00 on a Monday, so only a few tables were occupied. The menu had a wide variety of options, so we needed some time to decide. The staff came by twice to ask if we were ready, but when we were finally ready to order, no one paid attention to us.\nWe ordered the House Special Beef Pho and Chicken Pho, along with an Oyster Egg Cake. The pho arrived quickly, and we all loved the soup, meat, and noodles. However, the portion of bean sprouts and basil seemed smaller than at other restaurants. After finishing our pho, we were still waiting for the oyster dish. We thought about canceling it, but just as we were about to, the oyster dish arrived. It looked large, crispy, and delicious, especially when dipped in the special source.Unfortunately, the egg and oyster themselves were lacking in flavor.\nOne thing worth mentioning is that the environment here is quite noisy. Even with only a few customers, the loud music from two big screens, the staff talking loudly, and the sound of someone chopping behind the counter next to us made it difficult to enjoy a quiet meal.\nOverall, the food was good, though the price was slightly higher than other places. The service, however, could be improved."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNvT5pU-XVYdqIZVI9jLoYgddHskHQGpeHpsTTT\u0026fid=0x0:0x35f864943c2578fa""],""When"":""2024-8-27""},{""Name"":""Vincent Tang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIRTaPpbMwtWXlBMDWwH_pYmP3LMsknWyp6Tv9YEYXfKF2Yfg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This place is the best place in town for Authentic Vietnamese street food and pho.

Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by our waitress, whose welcoming demeanor set a positive tone for our visit.\n\nFood:\nOur meal consisted of two main dishes:\n\n1.\tSteak Frites:\nA 10oz AAA steak, accompanied by herbed garlic butter, fries, and a mixed salad with balsamic dressing.\nThe steak was ordered rare, and while it was well-seasoned, the texture leaned toward being slightly tough. The portion size, however, was generous, which is always appreciated. The fries were passable but lacked any distinguishing features, much like the salad, which was standard fare.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\n2.\tEggspectation:\n\nThis dish featured a 10oz AAA strip loin paired with two sunny-side-up eggs, toast, and Lyonnaise-style potatoes.\nOnce again, the steak was ordered rare, and though it was adequately seasoned, it was a bit challenging to chew. The toast was serviceable, and the eggs were prepared well, with a good balance of seasoning. The Lyonnaise potatoes were a highlight, adding depth to the dish. Overall, the meal was satisfactory, with portions that were ample and filling.\nRating: 7/10\n\nDrinks:\n\n•\tIced Tea:\nA refreshing choice, with a sweetness that will appeal to those who enjoy their iced tea on the sweeter side.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n•\tTropical Paradise:\nA vibrant blend of banana, strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, mango, and pineapple, balanced with orange juice.\nWhile the concept was appealing, the execution left something to be desired. The drink was enjoyable but failed to leave a lasting impression.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nAmbiance:\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is one of its stronger points. The space is both cozy and expansive, offering comfortable seating that invites you to linger. The decor is ok yet warm, contributing to a relaxed dining experience.\n\nService:\n\nThe service was a standout aspect of our visit. Our waitress was attentive, accommodating, and ensured that our needs were met promptly. Her professionalism and friendliness elevated the overall experience.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nPrice:\nThe pricing was reasonable, particularly given the portion sizes and the overall quality of the food.\n\nVerdict:\nIn summary, while the steak dishes were well-seasoned and generously portioned, the texture left something to be desired, even when ordered rare. The rest of the meal, though satisfactory, did not exceed expectations. However, the pleasant ambiance and excellent service made for an enjoyable dining experience overall. I would be inclined to return to explore more of their menu offerings, as there is potential for standout dishes."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOlLK7zykKa-myAVscpuZtkI_SalNqUjQ5mQ5MW\u0026fid=0x0:0x47505ece0f6d256a""],""When"":""2024-9-18""},{""Name"":""Isabelle M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUjnyGmGPWOlMXQLMXfzyDVTGb4-cQ0NOmpHt9HtPktObHyCwQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Food is delicious and not overpriced, their food portions are huge and I was considering ordering dessert however I could not make it through half of my food.

Richmond certainly knows how to draw a crowd with their National Burger Day BOGO deal.\n\nThe initial service was commendable, with a server who was both attentive and friendly, setting a positive tone for the meal.\n\nThe nachos, however, were a letdown, lacking the robust topping variety one might expect, and while the cheese quality surpassed that of Good Co, the absence of salsa left the dish feeling incomplete. The smash burgers, a highlight in theory, fell short in execution with under-seasoned patties and disproportionately large buns that detracted from the overall moisture and flavor.\nThe fries, too, were a disappointment, promising crunch yet delivering a softness that defied their well-cooked appearance.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the restaurant filled, the attentive service waned, with a noticeable delay in receiving the bill. Observations of other staff members attending to tasks while my server was overwhelmed suggest a potential mismanagement of duties. This experience leaves one pondering the disparity between personal experience and the glowing reviews Cavu Kitchen Bar has received."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO6_X3uyaS0PsCnyoMPkXmBxzbp3rrTSI0fLxKY\u0026fid=0x0:0x9a24da6028bc44b9""],""When"":""2024-6-18""},{""Name"":""Reilly videos Games"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIDebdSxW4i3fCCuDyEg4qjUboi7kZm60BzHcCT6gi5MHuU-w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I decided to throw my husband, a surprise 50th birthday party and CAVU popped up in my list.

Dharm \u0026 Rishi communicated very well \u0026 right away each step of the way. They are so accommodating including menu options, set up and small request here \u0026 there were all assisted in a very timely and smooth fashion. Their staff was friendly \u0026 helpful and had smile on their faces the whole time, we had a lovely bartender throughout the night (shoutout to him for being so kind and generous! He was the cherry on top of our night) and everyone was as thankful as we are- such a positive environment to be! The ambience is restaurant style but had that classy vibe that makes you feel that you are in a special place. The food was all delicious, it was a buffet and the food was filled all the time, plus the staff at the carving station had this great welcoming smile when he was serving the food. Parking was free for everyone as well which is fantastic. I got a lot of compliments from my guest, thanks to Dharm , Rishi and their Cavu Restaurant team- certainly made my husband party more memorable \u0026 special than it already is. As for the price, it is unbeatable and very affordable, amazing places like this still exist! It’s definitely a hidden gem in Richmond and I highly highly recommend everyone to support restaurants like these who strives to provide amazing service while being mindful of the prices they ask from their customers.

Terribly rude and ARROGANT owner.\n\nTheir website said complimentary shipping across Canada for orders over $45.\nWe ordered $100 ish worth of coffee beans and have them delivered to our place. One bag was missing.\n\nWe contacted the owner. First thing they do was to asked a friend of mine (who briefly worked for them as delivery before) to just pick it up and hand it to me. We rejected and kindly asked them to use the same delivery method and drop it off at my building concierge. They first rejected and insisted bringing me the bag of coffee face to face lol And then all in a sudden texted me saying they are shipping the coffee with FedEx the next day.\n\nA week later, I still didn’t hear anything. All I saw on fedex is that they have my package and there’s no estimate delivery date. I contacted the owner again. He said that means they lost the package.\n\nHe then said due to the complexity of the area I live, they won’t offer internal delivery again. (But I live in a condo in the central area of Metrotown and we have people at the concierge 24/7) and he doesn’t feel confident sending me with fedex either….\n\nSo he suggested to give me just store credits and asked me to swing by their “HEADQUARTER” which is the garage store to pick it up when I have time LOL (then why would I spend over a hundred to get shipping if I still have to run around just for a bag of coffee beans and that’s not even my fault in the first place )\n\nI asked them again if it’s possible to just deliver it the way you guys always do, I don’t care whatever it is. I just need the coffee. And I ask is it true that you guys will never deliver to the same address and nearby area ever again like what they mentioned. If that’s the case then I might need a refund. Store credits won’t help if I am ordering with the same address in the future. Or else, they should figure out a delivery method.  He was reluctant to answer and said okay we will just give you a refund!\n\nAnd it’s been almost three weeks, still no response on whether they will be delivering to me again, no refund, no coffee beans. Nothing. And they just simply ignore the issue.\n\nI think their coffee is okay. Options for specialty coffee are limited here. I always wondered why do they look like they are still struggling when they have been doing business here for so long and all the bad reviews on customer service.\nNow I figured.

The little side salad that comes with your meal is simple, fresh, light and so tasty that I always eat every single bit of it, and I’m someone who usually ignores a side salad. Service is always friendly and efficient and the place seems well cared for. If you love hot sauce, you’ll love the options here - there’s at least 14 different kinds.

Those holes that you see in the tables... That's where you're supposed to put your cones of fish and chips.

I used to like when they offered fish bites (you could get an assortment of smaller fish pieces so you could try all the different types of fish).\n\nSophie loved coming here and sticking her nose through the holes in the table to grab some fries.\n\nUPDATE Sep 2024: Not sure why it took us so long into this year for a revisit. Since we already had lunch, we just picked up an order of 1pc cod and chips ($14.50). It's still a good value if you ask me.

We made reservations for Thursday at 7pm and the place was pretty quiet, though it wasn’t the nicest weather out, so Steveston period was pretty quiet. I’m a huge seafood fan and love a good seafood tower, so with the help of my friend we did our best to take down the yatch sized tower! We were both thinking should we order an appy just in case the tower isn’t enough and I was soooo glad we didn’t! The tower has soo much seafood and could easily fulfill even 4 people with a sufficient amount of food, though with 4 you may need an appetizer? My fiancée had the fish and chips and she said she enjoyed them, nothing special but good fish and chips all the same! Our server was great, treating us all to a welcome/happy birthday shot and a nice piece of cake for dessert. The restaurant is a great spot and must be even better during a nice day. Solid food, service and atmosphere and would definitely go back to try something off the menu that is not a tower.

I will say that the Sablefish was great, it’s just that it sits on top of a pile (and by pile I mean a good 2 servings) of a flavourless bok choy soggy mess. There was enough overall for me to come again, but I would be expecting a lot."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOvs0aXE9q1Yo5wVeW5EEcmoplGo9gMx5dHZFX3\u0026fid=0x0:0x52f2df2f27450e2a""],""When"":""2024-8-16""},{""Name"":""Aidan Lui"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocISaRTvXTp5ZvZ1RxLZ7htLQGi5QqNClMziEEnqgzRL372wUA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The food is good.

Brunch Spot at Breakfast Table Steveston! 🍳\n\n🌞 Finally got to try the Breakfast Table—this time at their Steveston location after visiting Fisherman’s Wharf. The cozy, welcoming vibe was perfect for a family brunch. With a lovely rustic-chic decor and bright natural lighting, it’s an Instagram-worthy spot. The kids loved it and are already asking when we can go back!\n\n🥞 The food was fantastic! We enjoyed both savory and sweet options, all beautifully presented on charming rustic plates. The portions were generous, and everything was packed with flavor. The staff was super friendly, and the restaurant was very accommodating for families.\n\n🍴 Located right in Steveston Village, it’s a perfect spot to fuel up before exploring. The relaxed atmosphere and attention to detail make it a wonderful place to start the day.\n\n⭐️ Breakfast Table Steveston is a must-visit for anyone in the area. Whether you’re a local or just visiting, it’s a delightful spot for brunch with family or friends.

I also got a Hipster Benedict because I wanted to try their house made bacon, with fries instead of breakfast potatoes.\n\nOverall, I was not too impressed with their Benedict. The eggs were poached well, but I didn't get a lot of flavor in them. The bacon was also only just okay, which was a shame, I was expecting to be impressed! However, the fries were amazing.

In this day and age, I read \""Good Co\"" and expected it to be predominantly health-minded, probably with a plant-based focus and eight dishes drizzled with green goddess dressing.\nIn fact, it was much more of the comfort food variety, where everything is either fried or deep fried.\nI was pleasantly surprised, and have been craving their lemon pepper fries ever since!\nOur party's spread included: nachos, fish and chips, fish tacos, wings, lemon pepper fries, loaded tater tots, and the shrimp fettuccine.\nI've only included a photo of the nachos as I was too busy stuffing my face to take any other photos.\nOf all those dishes, the only one I felt disappointed by was the tots and I can't put my finger on why.\nService was decent, and my complaints are few:\n- Our table was rather sticky\n- The seats for the long tables are placed with their backs too close to the next table's. Uncertain if this was due to shuffling over time or simply a crowded floor space. Honestly, it didn't feel crowded when we walked in.\n- Bugs, but what can you do? It's a waterfront spot with garage door walls, so you get to enjoy the riverside air, and sometimes that means bugs! It also means having the sun shining directly into your eyes due to the absence of any kind of awning or overhang, but the breeze is still worthwhile!\n\nOverall a lovely day"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMWyJ1FaEu_XDy4qb2Tl2LyLyz5lCP4cXaR0nqS\u0026fid=0x0:0x528e5e2089f5c415""],""When"":""2023-7-24""}]",

I got the Elk Burger and I got gluten free buns as well. They actually tasted surprisingly good. Could hardly tell they were gluten free. Didn’t have that chalky texture and the burger itself was nice and soft too. Usually elk has a much tougher gamey texture. The aioli was a nice touch as well. I’m just like everyone else. I hate spending more money at the airport too, but don’t let slightly higher prices deter you. You may as well pay a slightly higher price to not feel like you drank a cup of canola oil at some fast food place. Give it a try. I might have to give the west broadway location a try soon as well.

Her response was shocking—she said it was a company system, and she didn’t know the details. When I expressed surprise, mentioning that as an employee, she should be familiar with it, she replied, “If you have any questions, you can call the company directly.”\nHer dismissive attitude took me by surprise, and it didn’t end there.

I got their limited egg tart bubble waffle and the seasonal pumpkin cream iced chai latte. I was especially excited about the egg tart bubble waffle and it was so good, with bites of gooey egg custard in each bubble. Very unique! The pumpkin cream iced chai was also delicious. The cream layer wasn’t too heavy, almost like a thick foam top.\nI saw that they carry sushi and sandwiches but they didn’t have any available when I was there, it was just a few bentos (pork or beef I think), roll cakes, and cheesecakes.

Besides the fact that it was the worst congee I've ever tasted in terms of flavours and add-ins (it was gritty and unnecessarily deviated from classic and familiar tastes; a sorry excuse for a century egg and pork congee), we found a piece of plastic in the the congee to which we notified the server.\n\nThe server apologized and asked if we'd like to replace it with the same item or with a different item on the menu, to which we declined. As I was uncomfortable and expressed my disappointment, they additionally added a 10% off from gratuity to our bill, however I felt that more reparations could be done, as simply removing the item off my bill does little to win me over as a customer. Are we just collectively pretending that nothing happened when you put my health in danger? Why would I want more congee when you boiled it with the plastic? How did it even get into the food?\n\nAs I was displeased with the food and service, I left a $3.50 tip on the $53.60 bill. I honestly did not want to tip at all, but felt that the rest of the food, such as the Ginger Milk Custard, was quite good. I felt my tip was reasonable given the circumstances but their continued service left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nAs we were leaving, the waitress who took our bill chased us down and complained that we did not leave at least a 10% tip so that we cannot leave. She said they had already taken 10% for gratuity so that the least we could do was to add to their tip so that it would be at least 10%. Outrageous. Did we forget as a society that tips were given for good service or did we become entitled to it? Not only was this tip requirement never expressed on their menu or in any fine print, it's unreasonable to treat your guests with mediocre food that had plastic in it; my expectations were not matched either. Good tips were not warranted for this type of subpar service.\n\nI understand that the plastic was a mistake but chasing us down clearly wasn't a mistake and I found it highly unprofessional and simply just horrible customer service. Anyways, we (again) expressed that we found plastic in our food and it made the rest of the eating experience quite uncomfortable as everyone at the table lost their appetites from the experience (it was also the first thing served to us; incredible start to the meal!).

I like that they have more savoury items than sweet, but both are done well. The scones are a highlight and freshly baked. Favourite was the sablefish and salmon oshi. Desserts were not overly sweet, very uniquely made and all the flavours came together.\n\nCons are 1) teas are very lacking, don't order the Earl Grey Green tea, never had such bland tea before! even when l asked for a second bag, there was no flavour... but I appreciate that the server changed our tea after we requested a different one.\n2) Service and timing of the food coming out was the most disappointing. We were 1 of only 2 tables and it took almost 40mins...\n3) the kitchen is an open kitchen and noise from\nwhat theyre preparing in there can be quite loud and distracting. Also it didnt help that the other table that was close to us was an extremely loud group and really hampered the relaxing atmosphere.\n\n4)Server really needs more training, it’s like it was her first job. She is not attentive. I’ve never gone to an afternoon tea place and been given our tea without any cream/sugar or a tea spoon until we asked…. she also can't speak English well so\nshe had a hard time describing what we were served, 2 instances where she did not know what the particular dish included. I ended up asking her to speak Mandarin instead. Please train her to understand the menu better. It’s a $65 tea set per person so I really expect better than this, considering your price point is only $10 less than an afternoon tea at Five Sails.\n\nThe restaurant is behind Versante Hotel, and there is no free parking ($3 for 2hrs).

Parking is street parking around the corner, or paid parking in the parkade. The restaurant can be a little confusing to find because the only signage saying \""Yandoux\"" is a sidewalk sign that leads to a very dark nameless door on West Road. When you enter it's a dim lobby, and Yandoux is on the left.\n\nThe space is bright, nicely decorated, very clean and quiet. Afternoon tea reservations are allotted 2 hours of seating time, but it was more than enough for a leisurely stay. If you are booking for 5+ people, they will call you for a deposit that you make via e-transfer.\n\nThere's a sizeable list of teas to try. I ordered an Elderberry tea, and while you can order milk and sugar to go with your teas, my friends and I found the teas fragrant and sweet enough on its own without needing to milk/sugar as we usually do. Our server continuously came by to refill our pots with hot water and that was very appreciated.\n\nThe photos show food for 2 afternoon tea sets. Everything was really nicely prepared and tasted wonderful. The sablefish, and the prosciutto burrata were my favourites of the savouries. The desserts all tasted really good, and not too sweet. My only complaint was that I found the sable in the lemon tart to be overbaked and very dry.\n\nEach tea set is $65 excluding tax/tips, and while it's a little pricier than other afternoon teas i've experienced, the overall stay and food is worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNJwvQwGo7QQZ8eYri63cHMWy75Uyz-OAhhBJiO\u0026fid=0x0:0x8ab573618998f0b4""],""When"":""2024-8-18""},{""Name"":""Angela Q"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWb_531iDFVKCasGm6UvuKw9uZaENkT6KFE4j7gJIfH4GYfpwM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Absolutely Delightful!\nThe set was stunning, with a beautiful selection of desserts and savory bites.\n\nThe ambiance was cozy and elegant, and the staff were attentive and welcoming.\nA must-visit spot for dessert lovers or anyone looking to enjoy a relaxing and luxurious afternoon.

The latte and London Fog were pretty good and the barista surely did a good job.\n\nThe bakery products looked nice but they were the star deducting items. The croissant was hard and so dry. The moment I poked my fork on the muffin it broke into very dry crumbles. I could see the “honeycomb” shape inside that indicated the baking powder and ingredients were not properly mixed before baking. I suspect these were the supplier quality issue.
