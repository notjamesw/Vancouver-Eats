I can understand because we did come during the lunch rush and they were slammed.\n\nI had a salad and the vegetables were a bit wet still, but the balsamic dressing and choice of vegetables was decent. The sweet potato yum fries were a bit cold by the time they arrived to use, but they were seasoned well and still fairly crispy.\n\nMy girlfriend had an eggs Benedict dish and I think the execution of it was fairly well done. They didn't ask for how she wanted her eggs done though, so definitely inform them if you specifically want a doneness. The other execution or weird decision was putting arugula underneath hot bacon. It was wilted, unseasoned, bitter and a bit wet. That was a fairly weird decision instead of quickly dressing it with something and putting it off to the side so it wouldn't wilt. I could understand if it was cooked or quickly tossed in a pan, but it was just raw arugula.\n\nMy absolute favourite thing here was the Danish.

The little side salad that comes with your meal is simple, fresh, light and so tasty that I always eat every single bit of it, and I’m someone who usually ignores a side salad. Service is always friendly and efficient and the place seems well cared for. If you love hot sauce, you’ll love the options here - there’s at least 14 different kinds.

Richmond certainly knows how to draw a crowd with their National Burger Day BOGO deal.\n\nThe initial service was commendable, with a server who was both attentive and friendly, setting a positive tone for the meal.\n\nThe nachos, however, were a letdown, lacking the robust topping variety one might expect, and while the cheese quality surpassed that of Good Co, the absence of salsa left the dish feeling incomplete. The smash burgers, a highlight in theory, fell short in execution with under-seasoned patties and disproportionately large buns that detracted from the overall moisture and flavor.\nThe fries, too, were a disappointment, promising crunch yet delivering a softness that defied their well-cooked appearance.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the restaurant filled, the attentive service waned, with a noticeable delay in receiving the bill. Observations of other staff members attending to tasks while my server was overwhelmed suggest a potential mismanagement of duties. This experience leaves one pondering the disparity between personal experience and the glowing reviews Cavu Kitchen Bar has received."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO6_X3uyaS0PsCnyoMPkXmBxzbp3rrTSI0fLxKY\u0026fid=0x0:0x9a24da6028bc44b9""],""When"":""2024-6-18""},{""Name"":""Reilly videos Games"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIDebdSxW4i3fCCuDyEg4qjUboi7kZm60BzHcCT6gi5MHuU-w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I decided to throw my husband, a surprise 50th birthday party and CAVU popped up in my list.

Dharm \u0026 Rishi communicated very well \u0026 right away each step of the way. They are so accommodating including menu options, set up and small request here \u0026 there were all assisted in a very timely and smooth fashion. Their staff was friendly \u0026 helpful and had smile on their faces the whole time, we had a lovely bartender throughout the night (shoutout to him for being so kind and generous! He was the cherry on top of our night) and everyone was as thankful as we are- such a positive environment to be! The ambience is restaurant style but had that classy vibe that makes you feel that you are in a special place. The food was all delicious, it was a buffet and the food was filled all the time, plus the staff at the carving station had this great welcoming smile when he was serving the food. Parking was free for everyone as well which is fantastic. I got a lot of compliments from my guest, thanks to Dharm , Rishi and their Cavu Restaurant team- certainly made my husband party more memorable \u0026 special than it already is. As for the price, it is unbeatable and very affordable, amazing places like this still exist! It’s definitely a hidden gem in Richmond and I highly highly recommend everyone to support restaurants like these who strives to provide amazing service while being mindful of the prices they ask from their customers.

Our food came all together and was fresh, hot and each order was spot-on.\n\nSix of us opted for burgers -- one Meadows Loaded, one Black Bean Veggie, and four Wild Salmon which turned out to be Sockeye(👍). The  Salmon Burger afficionado in the group, the one who orders it anytime it's on the menu, said it was a very good Salmon Burger.\n\nAnother ordered the Butter Chicken, his cleaned off plate was obvious testament to its respectability considering his South Asian roots.\n\nThe last of our group had the Seafood Pasta which really impressed. The sockeye salmon, prawns and scallops were fresh, plentiful and perfectly cooked (not overcooked!!!). The whole dish was delicicous, perfectly seasoned, not heavy and not salty (thank you!).👌 The serving was too large to finish but the diner still raved about the meal when they polished off the remainder at home hours later.

On this visit, we were a party of three adults and a toddler, to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary. Having dined here before with a larger group in the intimacy of a private room, I was eager to see if the experience would be as outstanding as our first visit—and it absolutely was.\n\nLittle Karp masterfully blends the vibrant flavors of Asian and West Coast cuisine, using only the freshest seafood and local ingredients, many of which are sourced daily from the nearby fishing village of Steveston. This isn't your typical Asian restaurant; the kitchen at Little Karp crafts an exquisite fusion that takes your taste buds on a journey, elevating every dish into a memorable experience.\n\nAlthough the entrées are designed for individual servings, we chose to share our plates, creating a delightful communal meal.\n\nOur evening began with the Nova Scotia Lobster Ceviche, a refreshing medley of lobster meat, cilantro, habanero peppers, mango, cucumber, shallots, and chives, paired perfectly with their Garlic Cheese Bread (quickly consumed by our 3 year old granddaughter).   Next came the Clam Chowder—an unforgettable dish made with white fermented soy bean curd, fresh clams, and fennel, its flavors both comforting and intriguing.\n\nOur mains included a beautifully executed Wild Mushroom Risotto and the standout Hainanese Chicken Rice, which was nothing short of exceptional, accompanied by a side of perfectly seared Scallops.\n\nWhen reserving our table, I mentioned our special occasion, and to our delight, the evening was capped off with a complimentary chocolate ganache, adorned with whipped cream, strawberries, and blueberries—a sweet and thoughtful gesture from the restaurant.\n\nAs I observed the dishes being served at other tables—Wagyu burgers, fish fillet, fish and chips, filet mignon, seafood paella, and succulent crabs—I couldn't help but make a mental note to return and explore more of their diverse offerings.\n\nFor those who appreciate Asian cuisine, the innovative blend of spices and techniques with Western and European influences at Little Karp is truly something special. The impeccable service, delivered by a team of professionals, only adds to the overall experience. This is a place you simply must try—it promises not to disappoint."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNjYTUcIW9XwjK_xjctHSe4Gv5bYFSMfzXyLGPy\u0026fid=0x0:0x873cd22b28d4ccaa""],""When"":""2024-8-26""}]",

However, no one batted an eye as we were led to our table. The waitress, same name as me, Michelle, was kind, helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. We knew we would be looking at more expensive prices but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nI ordered the Blackened Halibut Burger and the flavors were incredible! I could've eaten two! My partner ordered the Chicken Pasta and he said it was amazing. We both decided to splurge and go for desert. He's a sucker for the New York Cheesecake with Fruit coulis while I went for the Apple Struddle with Vanilla Bean Gelato. It was so yummy! I don't even know how to describe it other than delicious.\n\nWhen the bill arrived we noticed the deserts were missing. We called Michelle over and asked if she had missed them. She explained that she felt bad for our situation and wanted to do something kind for us to make our situation better! She also made a joke about wanting us to remember Vancouver in a good way! Well, we definitely will. 😊 I'm so glad we found 75West that evening. It had been a long and gruelling two days of travelling and that meal/experience more than made up for it.

I’m a huge seafood fan and love a good seafood tower, so with the help of my friend we did our best to take down the yatch sized tower! We were both thinking should we order an appy just in case the tower isn’t enough and I was soooo glad we didn’t! The tower has soo much seafood and could easily fulfill even 4 people with a sufficient amount of food, though with 4 you may need an appetizer? My fiancée had the fish and chips and she said she enjoyed them, nothing special but good fish and chips all the same! Our server was great, treating us all to a welcome/happy birthday shot and a nice piece of cake for dessert. The restaurant is a great spot and must be even better during a nice day. Solid food, service and atmosphere and would definitely go back to try something off the menu that is not a tower.

Ordered the Billie and Jethro and large french fries.   Restaurant is slightly dark on the inside, but overall, very nice looking.  Person at the counter was very pleasant.  Quickly discussed the \""out of stock\"" menu items being actually out of stock.  I thought it might have been a mistake with the on-line menu.\n\nMe and my daughter tried both sandwiches;  Billie and Jethro, and came to the conclusion that the sandwiches were just alright.  We found the sandwiches not very tasty, kind of bland even.  The Jethro did not have a strong cumin flavor.  I thought the pork belly was not as salty as I would like, especially being cured.  The same can be said for the Billie.  Did not really get much flavor from the meat, or the rest of the ingrediants for that matter.\n\nThe other issue with the two sandwiches were how dry the bread was.  I believed they were brioche buns.  The dryness in the buns made the sandwiches a little tougher to eat.   The meat was not as moist as well, which did not help matters.\n\nFrench fries were OK.  The first few were again kind of bland.  The more you dug down into the fries, the better it started to taste.\n\nOverall, was expecting better, especially when the name has the word \""Smokehouse\"" in it.  Being in the area, I was hoping to have a go-to place for something like this.

My fav was probably the scroll loaf and the broccolini, but you can never go wrong with broccolini. There just wasn't any wow factor to any of the dishes. The burrata salad would've been better if there weren't so many beets. It almost felt like a beet salad, wish there were more greens instead. I honestly didn't really taste much of the truffle for the potatoes, so it felt like I was just eating potatoes. I didn't enjoy the tamahawk. There wasn't much flavor even with the sauce.

We love the potato tots, ahi tuna, steamed salmon, tuna aburi and the rest of what is on the sushi tray.\n\nSo, those are only two negative things out of more than 20 positive things to have dining at Bruno’s and the rest of the food was very very good. I’m definitely coming back here with the family as I know there are many good options and just go from there. We were supposed to go to Arc’s eat all you can, but you will have more healthy protein loaded options here if you want to make your calories intake more worth it like myself lol. Just had one plate for my main and I was filled with lots of great food options. Oh, I got stuck with the chocolate bark and fruits, and the lemon tart too…. It was a nice choice to end my meal.\n\nI get what the others commented on the one round drink which is not good enough. But since I drink water and coffee, I’m good. Water is unlimited.

When they stir fry the pork, they should use the excess oil to add to the rice and mix the flavor so to enrich the rice with the salty pork flavor.

Besides the fact that it was the worst congee I've ever tasted in terms of flavours and add-ins (it was gritty and unnecessarily deviated from classic and familiar tastes; a sorry excuse for a century egg and pork congee), we found a piece of plastic in the the congee to which we notified the server.\n\nThe server apologized and asked if we'd like to replace it with the same item or with a different item on the menu, to which we declined. As I was uncomfortable and expressed my disappointment, they additionally added a 10% off from gratuity to our bill, however I felt that more reparations could be done, as simply removing the item off my bill does little to win me over as a customer. Are we just collectively pretending that nothing happened when you put my health in danger? Why would I want more congee when you boiled it with the plastic? How did it even get into the food?\n\nAs I was displeased with the food and service, I left a $3.50 tip on the $53.60 bill. I honestly did not want to tip at all, but felt that the rest of the food, such as the Ginger Milk Custard, was quite good. I felt my tip was reasonable given the circumstances but their continued service left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nAs we were leaving, the waitress who took our bill chased us down and complained that we did not leave at least a 10% tip so that we cannot leave. She said they had already taken 10% for gratuity so that the least we could do was to add to their tip so that it would be at least 10%. Outrageous. Did we forget as a society that tips were given for good service or did we become entitled to it? Not only was this tip requirement never expressed on their menu or in any fine print, it's unreasonable to treat your guests with mediocre food that had plastic in it; my expectations were not matched either. Good tips were not warranted for this type of subpar service.\n\nI understand that the plastic was a mistake but chasing us down clearly wasn't a mistake and I found it highly unprofessional and simply just horrible customer service. Anyways, we (again) expressed that we found plastic in our food and it made the rest of the eating experience quite uncomfortable as everyone at the table lost their appetites from the experience (it was also the first thing served to us; incredible start to the meal!). Also, quite hilarious that they specifically only talked to the one man of the group when directing their complaints to us, as he believed him to be in charge. It felt a little misogynistic frankly, as I, a woman was the one with my wallet clearly visible and I was also the one that paid and complained ab the situation.\n\nIn short, there are better places to enjoy dimsum and spend your money— especially in Richmond. This had to be the worst of the worst, only good for their convenience.\n\n‼️Reiterating again: bad service, bad food, interact at your own risk‼️"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPZtcDMB3amwypgql1AtLcQrn-7yl-rzRAbcZF8\u0026fid=0x0:0x5010fbdeb708d156""],""When"":""2024-8-25""},{""Name"":""whitekaminari"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVR6flZAZi5cGzy0yca_eUOfsBSKsO_LdazQ1dRHpT5lcEo-J-I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The best Shumai I ever had is served here.

incredible dining experience at this Italian restaurant in Richmond!

But what truly won my heart was the Chicken Parmigiana. I can confidently say it’s the best I’ve had in a long time. 🤤\n\nIf you visit, don’t miss out on their lasagna, mussels, and the Penne con Pollo pasta, which has become my all-time favorite.

We were craving some pasta and thought to give it a go.\n\nDecor of the restaurant is decent and well appointed with how they set their plateware. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman to come inside who was setting up for dinner service.\n\nWe had the Fettuccine Chef pasta and Fugni Pizza. The pasta had really, really tiny shrimp like the size of a dime, and the artichokes were mostly soft, but i had several pieces that were really hard and chewy that they were inedible. The pasta sauce was good though. The Pizza was ok, but what i disliked is that they didn't spread out the toppings so well, so you had these huge gaps on the pizza with no topping, and other areas that were so heavily clustered.\n\nWe were the only ones at the restaurant during dinner service, so i felt the Pizza could have been made better. This felt a bit sloppy. On the account that we were the only ones here, I was a bit disappointed that the serving staff didn't check up on the meal, nor top off our waters, and we had to go looking for the bill. No complimentary bread for an Italian restaurant (even a small bun) seems so odd to me. No virgin olive oil, pepper/salt, or chiliflakes accompanied the table. For the price point you pay for your meal and service, this was low value.\n\nIt seems after writing this review, and from looking at their menu on their website, the owners of the restaurant have not paid the web designers for their work. There are obviously spelling mistakes too. Whatever is happening on the back end, there appears to be issues at this restaurant. Had my partner and I seen this before, we would have skipped this restaurant all together, as it doesn't seem this restaurant has all it's housekeeping in order.\n\nI generally don't like to give poor reviews, but felt this review was warranted.\n\nRecommendation: Skip this restaurant."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOY14PPGry5WUGdV2ZKQ0XtI_FFmsh6Glyyn9Z4\u0026fid=0x0:0x221e203393d97bc1""],""When"":""2024-10-7""},{""Name"":""Tom McElroy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ3Bh85GEfn2VDi8cTB1uX2QhrWADRyX2xDL7GW_p2intWj8w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I had the pleasure of having dinner at the Bella Roma restaurant in the Grand Park airport hotel in Vancouver.

try this place and have seen good to great reviews. Parking is free for 3 hours by registering your vehicle at the restaurant. A great start! The private room we were in had us 12 adults and a toddler tightly squeezed around a table with two built-in hotplates. We had to ask for more chairs and cutlery even though a reservation was made and numbers were confirmed at the entrance. I didn’t think the regular menu was great (except for the price); there seemed to be a lot more choices in the premium one. Everything started to taste the same to me because the broths were so strong after a while. Our fault for dumping everything in all at once… The meat rings were a nice presentation touch, but there wasn’t room on the table for much more after they came. Overall, it would have been better to dine with a max of 4 pp so the food could be added into the pots more slowly for optimal savouring. We’ll have to give this place another try, especially with the premium menu. There were ice cream sandwiches and sea salt mints at the end. The mints were awesome! The service was a bit slow; we had to add for more broth, napkins, etc. The sauce / dessert bar was crowed with people and needed some cleaning up. I didn’t get to try much of it. There were items in hot plates that would have tasted great if they’d been temperature hot such as the black sesame dessert, deep fried glutinous black sesame balls and spring rolls."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP98pev_jxgZ402gx5wnJ74zcsi9Iaeb5HDencB\u0026fid=0x0:0x5c055ec6db84add0""],""When"":""2024-7-30""},{""Name"":""CL"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJEOodGjHk-7O4UQKg3jyAyeHD7p5mB9pYh7Meku93t9eyaqA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Our go to ayce hotpot spot!

Double soup base (spicy \u0026 pork bone broth). Pretty basic and standard.\n2. Sauce bar was pretty standard.\n3. Self serve appetizer bar. A dozen selection of cooked and cold appetizers . Plus a plate of chicken bones eaten by someone sitting there on the counter, do people actual act like animals in a public setting? (Rolleyes).\n4. Pork blood, quail eggs, frozen tofu, Chinese donut stuffed shrimp paste, selection of vegetables, bamboo piths, spam, tofu skin, enoki mushrooms. All pretty basic.\n5. Clams and scallops. Clams were small and scallops were a bit too thinly sliced.\n6. Sliced lamb and Wagyu beef plate. The lamb slices were okay but the wagyu beef was… ummm.. it certainly didn’t have that tender buttery taste to it and as you know I eat a lot of wagyu beef.\n7. Salmon, red tuna, hokkigai sashimi. The salmon was okay, a bit dry. The hokkigais were a bit slimy at one end and as for the red tuna, it was like eating a sponge soaked in water. (The quality could create an outbreak of food poisoning so the restaurant knows.. Facepalm). The wasabi was a paste from a supermarket squeeze tube. Ordered another round to confirm the quality but it never came! So pretty much paid $34 extra for a few small pieces of bad quality sashimi.\n\nThe service here was pretty generic but they sure bring the food out slowwwwww and they will also tell you that it takes a bit longer to prepare the sashimi?!?! (Yeah expect more than 35+mins wait for an order of sashimi and most likely you will get one round of it during the duration of your meal).\n\nThe food quality was pretty basic to below average eg. sashimi, beef, seafood. Therefore maybe it’s best to opt out of the premium and stick with the basic AYCE instead if you want to try this place out.\n\nOverall, it’s really a disappointing experience. You can rest assure that the experience will be nothing like how those so called foodies market it on social media. (Don’t know why I even believe those who twirl their beef on their chopsticks to begin with.. clowns).  I would say for a much better experience for a lower or similar price would be Marble Eatery, Cho Cho, Happy Lamb hotpot.\n\nIn conclusion there’s a Chinese saying, “if you open your door for business, do it properly not half azz it” Literally this place gave the impression of half azz’ing it by its delay and long wait time for the food to come out.  It really became an All You Can’t Eat!\n\nAn AYCE failed! No repeat or recommended.\n\nThumbs down 👎"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP9DCd22o6dY48ZFeryCODWOW2I-4x54JJIOQ0o\u0026fid=0x0:0x5c055ec6db84add0""],""When"":""2024-11-12""},{""Name"":""I Z (Zi)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKV8UTeDK4uoDwjtvwesLj4qTcCPJ8i1-s5e-BtxGQNgzgDrg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I decided to bring my dudes as I had a great experience with downtown location.

They also have some chili oil and vinegar on the side which goes very well with the food.\nOne critique is that quite a few bowls/dipping sauce plate were not cleaned properly when they were brought to us. There were stains on the bowls but the staff replaced them promptly for us.\nOverall, this place is a bustling small restaurant that serves traditional and well-made Shanghainese food, definitely recommend trying out."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNJ73RbXNrznTyP97waT0CspiAZn8NNJsAK4vO0\u0026fid=0x0:0xee865399f1ced67c""],""When"":""2024-3-17""},{""Name"":""Kristen Kim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJCTnlGGDfjks6LOZOqyzReM9yv0lbs4GhfHAqrIhrUvmL7jg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I would go back for the pan fried soup dumplings and wonton soup.

5/5\nService: 4/5 (-1 explained below)\nParking: free covered parking lot on site for customers\n\nLet’s start with the positive. The food was 5/5. Everything was delicious and was generously portioned. We were a party of two out trying a new spot so we ordered quite a bit to try out as much as we could. Everything was tasty! I mean it!  Would very much love to return to this place.\n\nAtmosphere was good too! It was sunny and nice. I think it’s suppose to be an bit of a more expensive viet place but the tables and menu needs some fixing. The tables were sticky 😭 I think it’s just the finishing material? Like maybe put a piece of glass on it? And the menu was this piece of paper. Maybe put it in a sleeve if menu needs to be revised? Still though it was a nice dining experience.\n\nBUT!! At the end of a wonderful meal where I had taken pictures of everything and was ready to pay. The young restaurant owner came up to us and said if we left a good review, we would get 5% off our bill. I kept saying that I have a system with how I review things and it takes time. But he was being very pushy and made it quite uncomfortable for someone with social anxiety. I clearly said no!  I was all ready to leave a 5 star when I got home but the pushiness at the end really left a bad impression. My bf caved and said he will leave a positive review. Look, I understand the hustle but if I said no…please stop pushing for it 😭\n\nI was very much ready to make this my regular viet spot. That’s how much I loved the food here. But the pushiness at the end made me not wanna go back. At least not dine in.

They are incredibly busy, so you will need to join their wait-list (just Google them and there is a link to join).  We tried to go around 6:30PM and there were already 45+ tables ahead of us.  We joined the list thinking that it would be well over an hour to get in, but we got a text 30 minutes in that our table was ready.  We weren't waiting at the restaurant, so we had to book it over.  My suggestion is to wait near the restaurant so you don't miss your table - they have the right to cancel your reservation and you'd have to join the wait-list again, which is no fun.\n\nOnce we got in, they handed each of us a bowl and you grab whatever you want for your hot pot.  We came with a 10 and a 6 year old and they were able to find enough things they wanted to eat.  There is a good selection of meats (beef, pork, pork belly, and lamb, your usual fish/seafood balls), wontons, lots of veggie and noodle options too!  Once you've selected your ingredients, you go up to the cashier, select the broth and you can choose to make it spicier (there were 9? options, plus upgrades) they weigh your bowl and that is the price you pay.  You can add rice and a drink at an additional cost.  You can choose to dine-in or do take-out.  We dined in.  We got a number for each of the bowls and they cool everything for you and bring it to your table.  While waiting, you can get your sauce ready - they have your usual selection and they have suggestions for combinations.\n\nThe bowls came out super fast and the wait staff were attentive in giving us new water jugs once they were empty.  Overall, this was a great experience.  The kids were super full, we got a free small vanilla ice cream in a cone at the end to cleanse the palate.  Broth was a bit on the salty side for 2 of my fam, but my miso with medium spice was fine.\n\nWould totally come here again!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNGi9_qwrz8vJpXLBzMFUXn9uqPS-XGsDNPCZxn\u0026fid=0x0:0xc5b514872eb51c31""],""When"":""2024-9-28""},{""Name"":""Khrisofea Cadoy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU45fvbNeNLybtRTfhW4gvvXWwsAEF9dkiOaxM-3SwIvSKDGfsYAw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great experience :)\n\nAfter being seated, the employees were so kind to us.

They even voluntarily pack doggy bags for customers (now most restaurants charges bags and boxes while having customers self pack). Reminds me of the poor experience at a so called Michelin-Star Chinese seafood restaurant at Cambie St @ W Broadway which service is awful while charging Michelin price.\nRed Star’s washroom is super clean, even cleaner than another Michelin-star duck restaurant. Restaurant floor and table are clean without stains at all. Hard to believe this restaurant has been at the same location for more than 30 years!\nAlso Red-Star offers after meal desert with cookies. Vancourites have not seen this @ most Chinese restaurants for a long time.\nThank you Red Star for your good service and great food!

We checked with the waiter, who insisted that this was indeed half a portion. The duck was cold and dry. When we asked if it was leftover from the previous night, the waiter did not respond. The dim sum choices were fewer than before, and the rice roll we ordered was dry and hard.

Seafood Restaurant 🌸\n🌷🌷🌷\nVisited on a quiet Tuesday evening with my friends for dinner. 😊 The first thing I noticed was the ample parking space outside the restaurant, which is definitely a plus! 🚗 However, I didn’t spot any handicapped parking nearby, which was concerning for me as my legs weren’t feeling well that day. I sincerely hope the management addresses this before the grand opening. 🚶‍♂️🚫\n🎉\nStepping inside, I was greeted by a simple yet classy decor. 🪑✨ The table settings were spacious, accommodating groups of all sizes comfortably. Despite being a Tuesday night, the restaurant wasn’t very busy, with only about 10-12 tables occupied. For such a large space, it felt a bit underwhelming, but it also meant we enjoyed a peaceful dining experience. 🍽️\n🎉\nThe service was top-notch! 🙌 Our waitress, who I believe is one of the managers, greeted us with a warm smile. 😊 With a new management team in place, this was the perfect opportunity to see if they could make a strong impression. I asked a lot of questions about the dishes, and she answered them all in great detail. 🧐 The tea set was a pleasant surprise—glass teapot with a stand, and a small candle underneath to keep it warm. 🫖🔥 It’s clear the owner wants to bring something fresh and unique to the neighborhood. 🌟\n🎉\nNow, let’s talk about the food! 🍴 The BBQ duck was absolutely fantastic, expertly sliced by the manager herself. 🦆 The steamed fish was perfectly cooked, leaving the meat tender and fresh. 🐟 The BBQ duck meat, stirred with a special sauce, was a delight. 🍖 The lobster was alive and cooked to perfection, mixed with green bean vermicelli noodles that soaked up the flavorful lobster broth. 🦞🍜 Truly impressive! 😍\n🎉\nService was impeccable—our tea and hot water were consistently refilled, and the staff frequently checked on how we were enjoying the dishes. ☕👍 This place excels in every aspect. I’m confident that with a bit more time, dinner service here will be bustling! 🎉😄😄\n😁😁"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNfZZphW0JIEuDikMNCjosqgRzwg_xEY6XUR-iT\u0026fid=0x0:0x5204e99426acf00c""],""When"":""2024-8-26""},{""Name"":""Kasumi A.

They give you an apron to wear to keep your clothes clean and offer performances to keep you entertained. The shelves at the tables provide a smart option to hold more dishes in a small space, and they offer wet napkins at the end of your meal to clean up with.\n\nThe menu isn't the biggest I've seen but offers a variety of choices for all. Ordering the hand-pulled noodles will give you a table side performance of a piece of noodle being twirled and stretched before being dropped into your soup. Most of the items were good except for the beef tongue, which was on the tougher side.\n\nI really enjoyed the mask changing performance. It was very well executed so you couldn't see how it was done and exciting to watch up close.\n\nService was good. They unload your dishes from the robot to your table and even offered to peel our shrimps for us. They also check in periodically to make sure you're getting all of your food.\n\nThe biggest drawback was the price.

I highly recommend their Epic IPA—it's simply delicious. My personal favorite is the Cajun chicken burger with yam fries, a dish that never disappoints.\n\nThe location is also very convenient, with easy access by bus and SkyTrain, and plenty of free parking available. After enjoying a meal, you can even take a stroll over to Richmond Center Mall for some shopping.\n\nWhat truly sets this place apart, though, is the outstanding service. The staff are incredibly friendly and fun, making every dining experience special. I’ve had the pleasure of being served by Jennifer, Noah, and Jacob, all of whom are professional and ensure your food is made just right.\n\nCactus Club Cafe has maintained its delicious taste and high standards for over 20 years, and I highly recommend everyone give it a try.

Richmond\nAddress: 6060 Minoru Blvd #1782, Richmond, BC V6Y 2V7\n\nPearl Castle Café is a popular choice for casual Taiwanese fare in Richmond, known for its extensive menu of noodle soups, hot pots, and classic Asian-inspired drinks. While the food offers a mix of hits and misses, the overall experience is held back by noticeable service shortcomings.\n\nThe Food\n\nWonton with Chili Sauce\nThe wontons were tender and paired with a mildly spicy chili sauce, offering a balance of savory and heat. While the dish was enjoyable, it lacked a distinctive flavor that would make it stand out among similar offerings. Rating: 7/10\n\nSeafood and Pork Hot Pot\nThis dish includes an assortment of shrimp, mussels, pork slices, fish balls, crab sticks, and mixed vegetables, all served in a hearty broth. Although the variety of ingredients was impressive, the broth itself lacked depth and richness, leaving the dish feeling more ordinary than exceptional. Rating: 7/10\n\nHouse Special Beef Noodle Soup\nArguably the standout dish of the meal, the beef noodle soup featured thick, chewy noodles served in a robust and flavorful broth. The beef was tender and well-seasoned, making this a comforting and satisfying option. Rating: 8/10\n\nFried Oysters\nThe fried oysters were well-executed, featuring a crisp and golden exterior with a tender interior. The portion size was generous, and the flavor was excellent, making it one of the more memorable items on the menu. Rating: 8/10\n\nMango Slush\nWhile refreshing, the mango slush fell short due to uneven texture, with large chunks of ice disrupting what should have been a smooth and creamy beverage. The flavor was pleasant but not enough to compensate for the subpar preparation. Rating: 5/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe café is clean and offers a comfortable environment with simple yet functional decor. While the seating is cozy enough for casual dining, the ambiance lacks any standout qualities that elevate it beyond a standard eatery. Rating: 7/10\n\nService\n\nService was the most significant drawback of the experience. Despite the restaurant being relatively quiet, the staff appeared inattentive and unresponsive. Requests for assistance were slow to be addressed, which detracted from the overall dining experience. Rating: 4/10\n\nPrice\n\nThe pricing is reasonable, with portion sizes that offer good value for money. This affordability is a redeeming factor for the café.\n\nVerdict\n\nPearl Castle Café provides a satisfactory dining experience with a few standout dishes, notably the House Special Beef Noodle Soup and Fried Oysters. However, the lackluster service and inconsistent quality in some items, like the Mango Slush, highlight areas for improvement. While it’s a decent option for casual Taiwanese cuisine, it falls short of being a top-tier choice in Richmond’s competitive dining scene.\nA reliable choice for a casual meal, though better service and more consistent execution would elevate it further."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP_bZyZ2a_hw3BnkGVon-oX1w_6CoRAxunXjFXp\u0026fid=0x0:0xb5f2a84e7a397fe8""],""When"":""2024-11-29""},{""Name"":""Chloe Rachel"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWgExGuK1W-XgQc1tPnrQlqQkWxCTaNhdz977uVTTY3zjpsAzs-=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Was seated for lunch, but no staff had provided us with a menu until we asked for one.

My Taiwanese sausage wasn’t as sweet as these sausages are known to be. Also, the service continues to be poor - no smiles; we asked for a plate, but got a bowl (twice!); no appreciation of our patronage; not rude, but just kind of uncaring that we were there…so strange that this has not been improved upon.\n\nPast review:\nThe food was average to good, and the service was impersonal - definitely needs to be improved!

Unfortunately we ordered at 2:02 and our brunch request was denied (it ended at 2pm- SHARP!). So we went with a burger and chicken pot pie off the new menu. Burger was standard for White Spot. But, the chicken pie was inedible along with the salad accompaniment. It came out so burnt along the sides it was black. The salad had close-to expired greens and was mushy. We also had no check-in from our server throughout our meal. We couldn’t even receive  a refill of water until the very end when we were paying, despite both of us finishing our waters leaving our empty glasses on the edge of the table while we ordered our food.\nWhen it came time to pay, our server even acknowledged how the chicken pie plate was virtually untouched, as well as the burnt black pieces that were on the plate.

Kove restaurant today.  If my wife did not venture to the end of the dock we would not have seen the nice patio and view Kove has.  We were greeted by friendly staff.  The drinks (Blue Kahuna and 33 Acres beer on tap) were cold and yummy.  The waffles and fried chicken were savory.   The batter on the generous 3 pieces of chicken were seasoned well.  Waffles were good.  The syrup brought it all together.   The fish and chips were good.   The pacific rougheye fish was moist and had good texture for a fried fish. The fries were well seasoned although I would prefer a thicker cut.  It seemed like I got a lot of ends.\nOverall I highly recommend visiting here.

It merits a score of 9 out of 10.\n- **Calamari**: While the portion size was modest, the seasoning was impeccable. It earned an 8 out of 10.\n- **Chicken Wings**: These wings were outstandingly meaty and flavorful. They rightfully deserve a 9 out of 10.\n- **Rib eye Steak**: Though it could have benefitted from a pinch of extra salt, the overall quality was impressive. It receives an 7 out of 10.\n- **New York Steak**: well-balanced seasoning, this steak was a delightful dish. However, by the time we finished the appetizers, it was not as warm as it should have been. It earns a 7 out of 10.\n\n**Ambiance**: The restaurant provides a spacious and cozy environment, making it an inviting place to dine. The interior design strikes a balance between modern and comfortable, contributing to a relaxed dining experience.\n\n**Service**: The service was adequate, with staff members being generally attentive, though not exceptionally so. Improvement in timing would enhance the overall experience.\n\n**Price**: The pricing is reasonable, offering good value for the quality of food served. However, the overall value would be rated at 3 out of 5.\n\n**Verdict**: Moxies Richmond Restaurant is definitely worth a revisit. The food quality is high, and the ambiance is inviting. The only area for improvement is the service timing. By the time we finished the appetizers, our steaks were not as warm as they should have been.\n\n**Summary**: Moxies Richmond Restaurant offers a commendable dining experience with its delicious food, cozy ambiance, and fair pricing. The slight service hiccup is a minor flaw in an otherwise positive experience, making it a restaurant worth returning to."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPw6Iep1PTAq6vg97ou2EkfH8Z_rw7shDDqSKM4\u0026fid=0x0:0xf4303da5897c1038""],""When"":""2024-6-25""},{""Name"":""Rebecca Mole"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK4ixtYRzftYw5oQ6wNyclZzO44ipvwfYnNSSV-6BofP6fxYQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Calm Wednesday evening, our server was lovely and attentive, I ordered the super green salad and my family other dishes such as the cashew chicken lettuce wraps which was brought out by Patrick who I cannot commend enough for elevating the experience with the way he explained the meal and what would elevate it.

It was very noticeable on all four of the wall photos.\n\nWhen I shared my concern with the server, she was very apologetic and sent the manager over. The way the manager responded was so disappointing. She acknowledged the problem but seemed unbothered by it saying “yeah we’re working on it so thanks for the notice”. I pointed to the photo as visual indicator that whatever they are doing is not working and her response was “yeah they seem to like these paintings.” Um…ok. But this is indication of a food source for them which can only mean an issue in food handling in the back. I literally said “This level of appearance can only mean something wrong in the kitchen” and her choice to gaslight with “We don’t have any in the kitchen” dumbfounded me. Clearly I wasn’t getting anywhere.\n\nShe comped my drink which was fine, it was the cheapest thing on my bill but I guess at least thanks for the comp.\n\nI just can’t recommend people eat there until the restaurant gets this infestation under control.\n\nHott tip: a cup of wine or apple cider vinegar with a coffee filter cone does the trick.

The squid arrived hot, with a crisp exterior and well-balanced seasoning. The flavors were satisfying and memorable. 9/10\n\nCentury Egg and Shredded Salty Pork Congee:\n\nAmong the extensive congee offerings, I chose this variety. The congee was creamy and well-seasoned, with a generous amount of ingredients packed into a small bowl. The portion size was ideal for a light bite without being overly filling. 8/10\n\nAmbiance:\n\nThe seating was reasonably comfortable, though unremarkable. While the establishment was clean, there was an unpleasant odor lingering in the vicinity, which detracted from the overall experience. The source of the smell was unclear, but it did impact the ambiance. 5/10\n\nService:\n\nThe service was adequate, meeting expectations but offering nothing exceptional. It aligned with what one might anticipate from an establishment of this nature. 5/10\n\nPricing:\n\nThe pricing structure is mixed. While the congee was reasonably priced, the main dishes were slightly on the higher side. However, portion sizes were fair given the cost.\n\nDrink:\n\nIced Almond Milk:\n\nThe drink menu offers a wide selection, but I opted for the iced almond milk. It was refreshing and enjoyable. 7/10\n\nVerdict:\n\nI would consider returning, primarily due to the convenience of the 24/7 hours and the availability of parking. The extensive menu also offers plenty of options for future visits."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOEAxgKL2ND_kC2C_5m-XPcz3DtgA6v78XdvQpe\u0026fid=0x0:0x723922f9bf29f56f""],""When"":""2024-9-18""},{""Name"":""Manmeet Gill"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXMXWGi0PTwBnnJPx-2zRWWQX9viRcadnjBye5zp3cT1qRomGuzzA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We went to the restaurant around 10:40pm.

You need to get the 熱乾麵 dry noodles. I came around 11:30 and they already had orders piled around them. My order took around 10 minutes or less. I ordered 2 portions of the dry noodles and a portion of the 小面窩 small donut lookalike. The first time I had the dry noodles I feel in love with the sesame flavour and the crunchy pickled veggie inside. It might not look like a lot of noodles but it is very filling. I realized after ordering two portions that the way they season the noodles depends on the chef because both bowls of noodles were different even though it was the same dish. One was spicier and saltier than the other. So it really depends on your luck if you get a good bowl of noodles. The crunchy pickled veggies on the inside balance on the dish well. You MUST GET the 小面窩. It's crunchy chewy and very bad for you but good for your soul. It soaks up sauce really well and goes with everything. One portion of 3 is not enough. The price of the noodles is $7.90 and although there is no protein in it I think the price is reasonable. The xiaomianwo is 3 for $2. One serving is not enough for 2 people. You need one serving per person because it's just that delicious.

We started coming here when they first opened. I’ve noticed that their pizza dough has improved with age. It’s more chewy, more like the real thing. Well, I will report back after our New York trip! Most people leave the crust, I find that the best part because of the rise bubbles which are crispy and light. We are lactose intolerant and used to have to eat our pizzas without cheese. The last few times we were at The Parlour, we tried their cashew cheese and we really enjoyed it – it is more creamy than the normal cheese. I like their stack of short ribs as well and we often order a salad just for balance. They add dates and apples to the salad which we like. At lunch time, they offer personal size pizzas. The Parlour has now introduced a brunch menu with interesting items. The Short Rib \u0026 Egg Skillet or Skinny Skillet are not pizza based. Their brunch benny is served on a pizza. We like their patio, and they have an area inside that is fully open to the patio. The only down side is that it is impossibly crowded and loud on Friday/Saturday nights. So we don't come here when it is extremely noisy and crowded. Now that I've become vegan, we've been back for brunch. Only one server was aware that the pizza dough has egg wash on top. That server ordered me a lovely vegan pizza replacing the prosciutto and adding zucchini and pepper on top with cashew cheese. I came back twice again the weeks after but unfortunately, did not have the same server and therefore, I did not get the vegan pizza I came back for.

One of our guests brought their child and another one brought their infant - both of the little ones enjoyed the space as well as they roamed around the room as if they were running a marathon.\n\nFood was excellent. We chose a group dinner set menu. For the main course, everyone either picked the prime rib or the new york strip loin. They also served kids meal for the young ones. All of our guests loved and commented how they enjoyed the 3-meal course.\n\nThe staff service was nothing short of top-notch. They were very attentive and efficient.

It is quite obvious how much thought and money was put into creating and executing each dish! The restaurant itself had nice decor, relaxing music, the utensils and glassware being incredibly delicate and was just as worthy as the food, not to mention the incredible open view of the water. The tea pairing also had incredible colour and aroma that matched nicely with each meal (I wish I could have tea like that everyday.) The service was an honour to experience, as the coordination between servers were very synced and of course, kind and friendly.

Uncertain if this was due to shuffling over time or simply a crowded floor space. Honestly, it didn't feel crowded when we walked in.\n- Bugs, but what can you do? It's a waterfront spot with garage door walls, so you get to enjoy the riverside air, and sometimes that means bugs! It also means having the sun shining directly into your eyes due to the absence of any kind of awning or overhang, but the breeze is still worthwhile!\n\nOverall a lovely day"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMWyJ1FaEu_XDy4qb2Tl2LyLyz5lCP4cXaR0nqS\u0026fid=0x0:0x528e5e2089f5c415""],""When"":""2023-7-24""},{""Name"":""Jennifer Marie Luce"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIR17-f2uvH53RWeae86SBeoA6lKwQ4DRVfjUolfUKqFYT8AQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Four days after opening and still ironing out a few things.

I also got a Hipster Benedict because I wanted to try their house made bacon, with fries instead of breakfast potatoes.\n\nOverall, I was not too impressed with their Benedict. The eggs were poached well, but I didn't get a lot of flavor in them. The bacon was also only just okay, which was a shame, I was expecting to be impressed! However, the fries were amazing.

From what I've studied about the region,  this food was authentic and did not let me down.  It far exceeded my expectations and what's even better is the family who runs it.  English menus are made easily available and the family is friendly and able to suggest their favourite dishes.  I was given a very ample sized dessert sample which is made fresh daily from rice,  red beans and dates.   Not too sweet.  Just perfect and very fresh.  The crispy bun was indeed crispy on the outside but light in weight and filled with succulent pork with just the right amount of flavor and a couple drips of oil for good measure.  It had me checking the bag it came in to make sure no pieces were left behind.  Best of all where the glorious hand made noodles which I'll be thinking of for days to come.

One is that the enormous practically hundred page menu, does NOT have page numbers. So good luck clearly communicating to the server what specific kind of item you want. They have pictures which is great, but the missing page numbers really dragged the experience down.\n\nThe second thing was that I was scolded by the server to tip higher, as the amount I tipped (for a party of 1 having ordered 5 dishes already ranging from 20-45 bucks each) wasn't high enough apparently. I'd hope at prices like that the servers are getting higher than minimum wage, but in all my years I've never been called out and pressured to tip higher.

Drawn by its inviting ambiance, we decided to step in and explore what this skewer-centric establishment had to offer.\n\nUpon entering, we were greeted warmly by the waitress, who quickly set a welcoming tone. Despite not being entirely familiar with the setup, she kindly and thoroughly explained how the dining process worked, guiding us through the skewer selection and offering recommendations.\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe restaurant’s interior reflects a casual, sports-themed atmosphere. Small tables and simple chairs provide a functional setting, while numerous TVs—including a large screen—play various sporting events. The sports-centric decor suggests that the owner is an avid fan, and while the setup may not be overly sophisticated, it creates a relaxed environment well-suited to groups and casual outings.\n\nFood\n\nLu Charcoal’s primary offering is its wide variety of skewers. Diners are invited to peruse the BBQ display table and hand-pick their desired skewers, which are then grilled to order. We sampled a variety of skewers, each prepared with care:\n\n•\tLamb skewer: 7/10\n•\tBeef tongue: 7/10\n•\tChicken gizzards: 7/10\n•\tPork intestines: 7/10\n•\tSpicy beef skewer: 8/10\n•\tPork belly: 7/10\n•\tFish skewer: 7/10\n•\tBeef skewer: 8/10\n\nThe skewers, while on the smaller side, were well-seasoned and offered a satisfying blend of textures and flavors. Notably, the spicy beef and regular beef skewers stood out for their depth of flavor, and are highly recommended. Do keep in mind that a minimum of two skewers per order is required.\n\nIn addition to the skewers, we sampled some items from the main menu:\n\n•\tSquid Teppanyaki: 8/10\nThe squid was cooked to perfection, with a savory teppanyaki sauce that complemented its natural flavors.\n•\tTofu Clay Pot with Rice: 7/10\nServed sizzling hot, this dish offered a hearty and comforting flavor profile, though it could benefit from a bit more complexity in seasoning.\n\nService\n\nService at Lu Charcoal was prompt and attentive. The staff ensured that our orders were handled efficiently, and the waitress provided helpful explanations throughout our visit, which enhanced the overall dining experience.\n\nRating : 8 out 10\n\nPricing\n\nPricing at Lu Charcoal is reasonable, with the portion sizes justifying the cost. Given the quality of the food and the variety on offer, it’s a good value for those seeking an enjoyable, low-key meal.\n\nVerdict\n\nLu Charcoal is a solid choice for those looking to indulge in flavorful skewers in a relaxed setting. The variety of skewer options, combined with the friendly service and reasonable pricing, makes it worth revisiting. We look forward to returning to try more of their offerings.\n\nTips for Dining\n\nParking is limited in the area, and it can get quite busy during dinner hours. Making a reservation is recommended to ensure a smooth dining experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMY6_q3NGSgsTVzdh2o2eQqzN0GntP3-Z0v_QEy\u0026fid=0x0:0x18a4ba66dfd32b4a""],""When"":""2024-10-9""},{""Name"":""Megan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocICR0jGe0k5gDisGrsljCpTwrEFG4uY-dATldnb1oklvcbtqVSd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I love to come here for breakfast.

The tea and the food came out fairly fast. Our server was polite, no complaints. There were more sweets compared to the savory items.

And when we arrived, that's what we were told as well.  We arrived on a Saturday around 6:30pm.  However, we were called back to restaurant 20 minutes later.  Table was available.\n\nPros:\n\nThe chicken Katsu is extremely tender, and juicy.  It was amazing soft and the battered was very good as well.\n\nTonkatsu was also very impressive.  We have been to some famous Japanese Tonkatsu restaurants in Japan and the meat wasn't even as tender. Very impressive.  It's not dry at all. Juicy and flavorful.  They use very good pork.  In the ramen, there was some pork strip and I noticed it's full of pork flavor and bits of fats on it, it was also very tender.  That's how I know they use really good quality pork.\n\nThe cabbage salad was offered free refill, along with the dressing, it was very satisfying.\n\nRice also unlimited supply.\n\nMiso soup was good. Like all the other Japanese restaurants but it's also unlimited refill.\n\nThe ramen was ok.  The soup was good, lots of ingredients and quality seafood but there texture of the ramen is average.  Nothing special.\n\nOne thing I noticed. The fried pork chop and chicken was excellent but the shrimp tempura even though they did a great job, somehow it's more oily than the fried pork and chicken. Not sure why but next time I'll just get the pork or chicken.\n\nThey home made their batter from bread, they shred it to small pieces, pretty impressive.

I saw they had Nagasaki champon ramen ($18.50) - a regional specialty with pork, seafood, and veggies on noodles. The soup was really good but the rest of the dish was a bit lackluster. It was hard to see the seafood because they were all on the bottom of the dish (they're were 2 mussels on the shell, 3-4 clams, small pieces of pork belly and a half egg).\n\nCouldn't come here without trying their katsu so ordered their assorted pork tonkotsu set ($24.50) and added an extra tiger prawn ($5.5) as well as a bowl of curry ($7.5). You get 1/2 of pork loin katsu, 2pc of cheese katsu, and 1pc of ebi.\n\nThe best thing is really their tiger prawn tempura. They really nailed down that light but crispy coating.

The food never misses, I have not tried a single thing I did not like.

Ordered consisted of a tuna/salmon don, chicken don, house roll, negitoro roll, california roll, spicy tuna roll and salmon roll.\n\nOverall food was OK.  For the tuna/salmon don, fish was sliced very thin, which gives the impression of more fish, but was not.  Fish was Ok, seemed fresh and not fishy tasting.  The house roll was more artifical crab and less tuna and salmon.   It was like eating a slightly better version of a california roll.   Negitoro roll was OK.  I would have like the green onion more mixed in with the toro, but overall tasted fine.  The remaining rolls were OK, but nothing spectacular.\n\nChicken don, which is like teryaki chicken with rice was not great.  Thought the chicken was overcooked and dry.  When its like this, it becomes difficult to eat.  Portion was fine, but must say, I had better.  I know the big part of this is the raw fish, but if you have something like this on the menu, I think its fair game to judge.\n\nOverall, it was OK.

Cosmo Plaza, 8788 McKim Way #1205, Richmond, BC V6X 4E2\n\nDining at Garden City Hot Pot offers a straightforward and satisfying hot pot experience, with a selection of well-executed broths and fresh ingredients. For our dinner, we decided to explore two separate soup bases—parsley and preserved egg for my friend, and homemade satay for myself.\n\nFood\n\nHomemade Satay Soup\nThe homemade satay soup was a highlight of the meal, delivering a robust and flavorful base. The broth was rich without being overly salty, offering a good depth of flavor that worked well with the various meats and vegetables we added. Its seasoning was balanced, making it a versatile foundation for the hot pot experience.\nRating: 8/10\n\nFatty Beef Slices, Beef Tongue, Meatball Combo, Spinach, Chinese Mushrooms\nThe quality of the ingredients was consistently high. The fatty beef slices were tender and well-marbled, offering a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The beef tongue provided a nice textural contrast, and the meatball combo added variety to the protein selection.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nShandong Noodles\n\nThe Shandong noodles were a standout, thanks to their perfect texture. With a firm yet smooth bite, they held up well in the broth and added a satisfying element to the meal. They absorbed the rich flavors of the soup while maintaining their integrity, making them an excellent accompaniment.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nDeluxe Sashimi Platter\nUnfortunately, the deluxe sashimi platter was underwhelming. While the presentation was acceptable, the portion sizes and quality of the fish did not justify its name or price. The cuts were smaller than expected and lacked the freshness and vibrancy one would anticipate from a sashimi platter at a dedicated hot pot restaurant. It felt more akin to pre-packaged sushi than a premium offering.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nService\nThe service at Garden City Hot Pot was generally good, though not remarkable. The staff were courteous and attentive, ensuring that our hot pot experience proceeded smoothly. However, there was nothing particularly noteworthy about the service—while competent, it did not stand out as exceptional.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nAmbiance\nThe restaurant is clean, comfortable, and well-suited for a casual dining experience. The decor is simple, and the seating is comfortable, providing a relaxed atmosphere without the noise or bustle often associated with hot pot establishments. It’s a pleasant environment for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings, though it lacks any distinctive character that would make it memorable.\nRating: 8/10\n\nPrice\n\nPricing is reasonable for the quality and portion sizes offered. While some dishes, like the sashimi platter, feel overpriced for what they deliver, the majority of the menu offers good value, particularly the hot pot ingredients and broth selections.\n\nVerdict\n\nGarden City Hot Pot is a solid choice for hot pot enthusiasts seeking a reliable and enjoyable meal. The homemade satay soup and the quality of the ingredients make it a worthwhile visit. However, certain menu items, such as the sashimi platter, leave room for improvement. While it may not be a destination for those seeking a truly elevated dining experience, it delivers well on the essentials and is certainly worth a return visit to explore more of the menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMkwDrM4JqcVpTwAFZdHnfSYlR0PgcMoteGX7qW\u0026fid=0x0:0x3db777204510de14""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""Y C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXms2sclWSEC3QGPeBjL-2kcGh7jSlO2Axdbzvyfen0VG-v--o=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Came here with family for dim sum.\n\nThe seating is very comfortable.

We were intrigued because you don't normally find dim sum at a hot pot place.\n\nFirst of all, the complex this place is in seems a bit sketch (or at least it's seen better days). Once you get inside the restaurant tho' it's not bad. You order from a tablet and you can get both dim sum and other items.\n\nWe started with the braised oyster hot pot. We don't find this at many restaurants any more. The oysters seemed to have a bit of a pan-fried fried texture to the coating and the oysters were accompanied with slices of liver.\n\nFor the dim sum items, they generally came out to about $9/$10 per dish. The deep fried taro and scallop dumplings had a creamy filling. The scallop itself wasn't great but the taro to filling ratio was spot on.\n\nThe shrimp spring rolls had a layer of seaweed on the inside of the wrapper and turned out crispy. The chiu chow dumplings had a thinnish wrapper encasing the pork/shrimp and peanut filling and turned out nicely.\n\nThe honeycomb tripe was fairly good although some pieces were slightly chewier. Meanwhile the steamed tofu skin wraps were quite large and saucy.\n\nOverall, pleasantly surprised at the dim sum options at this hot pot place and will have to come back to check out the rest of their dishes.\n\nUpdate: Returned in December for dim sum. They had a discount for cash payment (think it was 20%)\n\nUpdate: Late March 2024... finally came back to try out their hot pot menu. I like that you can either get a large hot pot or smaller individual pots. We wound up ordering the sukiyaki and pork bone broth.\n\nThey had a special where you can get a dish of grass carp slices for $0.01 if you post an insta story. I was surprised at how large the grass carp dish was. While some of the pieces had some fish skin on that was a bit chewy, it was otherwise a good dish.\n\nAlso got the veggie platter, fatty beef slices, meat ball combo, dumplings, and udon noodles.\n\nIt was a bit much for us to finish because the serving sizes are large. It would probably be better if you come with a larger party. We were quite full afterwards and had to take some home. Overall, good quality hot pot. Next time we plan to do one hot pot and add some dim sum dishes."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOjxkHGg54ddz4VqbiFq6tfDeQi-3kQKQixrMj2\u0026fid=0x0:0x3db777204510de14""],""When"":""2023-11-22""},{""Name"":""S H"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXJEaEUS1rKPUQqI-5muj1wBfBxSotijSfpk6Mu5w4Dwhojdx8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great food quality and very well washed vegetables.

Restaurant\n\nLocation: 4751 Garden City Rd, Richmond, BC V6X 3M7\n\nWe decided to visit Tsukiji Japanese Restaurant for a quick bite and were pleasantly surprised by the experience.\n\nAppetizer: Chopped Scallop with Tobiko and Mayo\n\nWe started with the chopped scallop mixed with tobiko and mayo, which proved to be an exceptional appetizer. The flavors were well-balanced, and the dish had a delightful texture. The only minor suggestion would be to increase the amount of dried seaweed on the side to enhance the presentation and add an extra layer of flavor.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10\n\nMain Courses:\n\nBeef Don\n\nThe Beef Don was a standout dish, featuring thinly sliced beef simmered with tender onions in a savory-sweet sauce. The seasoning was impeccable, and the beef was cooked to perfection, making it a truly satisfying meal.\n\nUnagi Don\n\nThe Unagi Don was another highlight, consisting of steamed white rice topped with grilled eel fillets. The eel was well-cooked, maintaining a good meat-to-skin ratio, and was enhanced by a sweet soy-based marinade. While the dish was enjoyable, I have experienced more flavorful versions at other Japanese restaurants.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nAmbiance: The ambiance was acceptable but a bit loud for a relaxing dining experience. The decor was simple and functional, fitting the restaurant’s casual dining theme.\n\nService: The service was prompt and generally efficient, though slightly unorganized. Multiple servers attended to our table, resulting in instances where our teacups were filled while still full. Additionally, the staff spoke to us in their native language, which could be confusing for some patrons. However, their overall attentiveness and friendliness were appreciated.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nPrice: The pricing of the dishes we tried was reasonable. However, we did not sample the higher-priced items on the menu, so we cannot comment on the value of those options.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWe would definitely consider returning to Tsukiji Japanese Restaurant, as there are many other dishes we are eager to try. The overall dining experience was pleasant, with a few minor areas for improvement.\n\nAdvice: When driving, don’t forget to register your car plate number to the greeter  inside the restaurant when parking to avoid any inconvenience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOizELin-ek5LKjIEnKUFBdtSy_yJjCShYIp_0w\u0026fid=0x0:0xeb752bef8d1328b8""],""When"":""2024-7-19""},{""Name"":""Joey"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJl9szXFCvkqiDIj8ffgxhpU02VBcZUaH8smB2SMyI4TIXdsaA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The sushi at Tsukiji, while decent, did not quite live up to the standards set by other Japanese sushi houses I've visited. The flavors were somewhat lacking in depth, and the freshness of the ingredients was not as pronounced as I had hoped. The selection was adequate, but it didn't offer the wow factor that I was looking for in a sushi dining experience.\n\nThe service at Tsukiji was average, neither exceptionally good nor bad. The staff were polite and attentive, but there wasn't a sense of warmth or personalized attention that can elevate a dining experience from ordinary to special. The efficiency of the service was commendable, but it lacked the personal touch that can make a restaurant stand out.\n\nOverall, I would rate my experience at Tsukiji Japanese Restaurant as a 5 out of 10. While it provides a satisfactory dining experience, it doesn't quite hit the mark in terms of the exceptional food quality and service that I seek in a Japanese sushi restaurant. It's a decent option for a casual meal, but it may not satisfy those looking for an authentic and outstanding sushi experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPuHI4KH6-5Kmn-tvB0PrlaLSZxSlRF6qMsGU-3\u0026fid=0x0:0xeb752bef8d1328b8""],""When"":""2024-2-20""},{""Name"":""Thomas Tsang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWMbWlbjKAl7qqxRHGjmQAk60HhIFw12wYodEXjrTHVEh2PFQU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great food and atmosphere.

We ordered the Bite of Everything, Spicy Agedashi Tofu and King Dragon Roll. This was more than enough for 2 people with some leftovers to take home.\n\nMost people seemed to order their bento box (dinner special), so of course we had to try a Bite of Everything. This is definitely a good sampler to try a variety of items from their menu. I’d say the nigiri was quite standard and basic. Didn’t feel the fish was amazingly fresh or anything. Infact most of the bento box was quite basic, it’s more catered to getting a sampler over quality. I’d say my favourite item was probably the tuna carpaccio and chicken karaage, it fried well and juicy. The Spicy Agedashi Tofu could’ve been spicier - I didn’t taste much spice, although it was fried nicely. I’d say my favourite thing hands down was the King Dragon Roll. It’s like a dragon roll, but so much better. The soft shell crab was fried nicely and texture, flavour, looks was all on point. If you’re looking for a roll here, get that one - you won’t regret it!\n\nOverall, I feel it’s a bit overpriced for the quality. I prefer higher quality, smaller portions while this is more quantity over quality. Besides the King Dragon Roll, there was nothing that stood out much to me. I left feeling pretty average so it’s not a place I’d go out of my way to.

So, when I saw Tang Vietnamese Restaurant in Richmond being promoted by many foodies on Instagram, I decided to try it out when I had the chance to be in Richmond. Today was the day.\nThe restaurant has a spacious outdoor and indoor dining area. We arrived around 12:00 on a Monday, so only a few tables were occupied. The menu had a wide variety of options, so we needed some time to decide. The staff came by twice to ask if we were ready, but when we were finally ready to order, no one paid attention to us.\nWe ordered the House Special Beef Pho and Chicken Pho, along with an Oyster Egg Cake. The pho arrived quickly, and we all loved the soup, meat, and noodles. However, the portion of bean sprouts and basil seemed smaller than at other restaurants. After finishing our pho, we were still waiting for the oyster dish. We thought about canceling it, but just as we were about to, the oyster dish arrived. It looked large, crispy, and delicious, especially when dipped in the special source.Unfortunately, the egg and oyster themselves were lacking in flavor.\nOne thing worth mentioning is that the environment here is quite noisy. Even with only a few customers, the loud music from two big screens, the staff talking loudly, and the sound of someone chopping behind the counter next to us made it difficult to enjoy a quiet meal.\nOverall, the food was good, though the price was slightly higher than other places. The service, however, could be improved."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNvT5pU-XVYdqIZVI9jLoYgddHskHQGpeHpsTTT\u0026fid=0x0:0x35f864943c2578fa""],""When"":""2024-8-27""},{""Name"":""Rob Campbell"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKDKhcs7-KcEnYJeV1fqvc8JWC7u5HpnLyUHUg7OzHFW57-qA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We were visiting from Calgary and was told of this place.

Then the second bowl, broth tatsted much better, but the beef sliced was tough and chewy, the bone marrow (probably not cooked long enought, still very jello like, and the noodles were mushy and clumped together...i told the server again and  asked for no replacement.\n\nAlso the snack (mini spring roll) was surprisingly MINI, teh dipping sauce tastes very sweet.\n\nPartner ordered chicken leg and fried egg rice. The chicken leg was super dry and flavorless, as if it had been fried into oblivion before being thrown onto the plate...\n\nEnvironment was ok, the interior is stuffed with many decorations, making the space seemed small. Also they have a few type of dining chairs in the restaurant, some are shorter than others, making a weired height with the table. Also, I dont really like their chopsticks, its made of wood and probably been used for a while, the wood starts to flake out. Just dont like to imagine that it been soaked in many bowls of pho, in people's mouth and soap many times...\n\nFinally let's not forget about the prices!! They charges PREMIUM prices for what can only be described as subpar fare. And not to mention they set their credit card machines minimum tip percentage 18%, though their food, service, and environment of this dining experience is far below what they thought they deserve.\n\nIn conclusion, it is definitely an unforgettable experience that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

The good ol airport. Vast majority of people lined up at fast food places, ready for the inevitable flight where they feel disgusting the entire time. Sure it’s like 5$ cheaper, but what’s 5$?

I got the Elk Burger and I got gluten free buns as well. They actually tasted surprisingly good. Could hardly tell they were gluten free. Didn’t have that chalky texture and the burger itself was nice and soft too. Usually elk has a much tougher gamey texture. The aioli was a nice touch as well. I’m just like everyone else. I hate spending more money at the airport too, but don’t let slightly higher prices deter you. You may as well pay a slightly higher price to not feel like you drank a cup of canola oil at some fast food place. Give it a try. I might have to give the west broadway location a try soon as well.

I will say, I was most impressed with the sushi chef (from Japan) and that the sushi was yummy! The quality may be because of what river rock is able to import, of course. At $50 a person, it’s difficult to really stomach it all. I understand there is a “variety of foods” but I just don’t know what else to add to its value.\n\nThat being said - I know there are many people that love coming here and celebrating special occasions!

The waitress was not very responsive, leaving us waiting for extended periods without any attention. When our food finally arrived, it was a huge letdown. The grilled fish, which should have been a highlight, was bland and lacked the proper seasoning. It wasn’t salty enough, and overall, the flavors were underwhelming.\n\nGiven the high prices, I expected much better quality and service.

The waiter had only brought me one bowl of rice, which wasn’t enough. I requested an additional one, but he was too busy to bring it. After waiting too long, I asked another waiter for the rice, even saying, “Where is the rice? Should I get it myself?” The second waiter eventually handed me another bowl.\n\nLater, when I went to pay the bill, the first waiter showed that I had eaten three bowls of rice. I said, “Oh, you made a mistake, I only ate two bowls of rice.” He then changed the bill to two but returned, insisting, “Actually, you’re mistaken - you ate three!”\n\nWhat the hell?😲😲😲 Why??? Why would I lie about $2???🤬🤬🤬\n\nI was angered by his attitude and refused to pay the bill, demanding that they show me the CCTV footage, or I wouldn’t pay a cent.\n\nHe told his coworker and the manager, who simply said it was a minor issue and that there were no cameras at the table. The manager wasn’t sure how many bowls I ate but kept repeating that it wasn’t a big deal, eventually letting it go.\n\nThroughout this whole process, no one apologized. Their attitude was extremely arrogant, as if I really had eaten three bowls of rice and was just trying to cheat them out of paying for one! It was incredibly disrespectful! I’m not a beggar!😡😡😡\n\nI paid the bill, but left no tip.👎\n\nIt wasn’t about the $2 rice - it was about dignity. I told them there was no reason to lie over $2.

The sauce was good (spicy and non spicy side).\n\nThe paneer momo butter sauce was my favourite. Great texture and the sauce was very flavourful with the perfect spice mix.\n\nThe classic street chowmein with chicken was another one of our groups favourite. Done as a dry noodle it definitely had a special flavour that I’m not sure I had encountered previously.\n\nThe cauliflower 65 had a nice soft and crunchy texture with a tasty sauce. This was the favourite of another one of our members.\n\nThe lollipop chicken was good but sort of expensive for what you got.\n\nOverall good food and we will be back to try the rest of the menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM7Ea1t7hMJA9y82obIR5D5UIgxrp2dl-BqnYB5\u0026fid=0x0:0xe897f5306f211d29""],""When"":""2024-3-30""},{""Name"":""Mrinal Gosain"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK7k-lUQh2pbIQHDunnLl6zbhF8yAEtkrD_O_rkec1s5BbWSg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Always great Momos, Love the Jhol momos.

I think their price is reasonable, but I agree is a little expensive if you order stuffed pasta like gnocchi, which they charge an extra $5. We also shared a brownie with 4 scoops of ice cream ($12) and it was delicious. I like that they play italian songs in the restaurant and the servers and hosts were nice as well. I would recommend this place if you want to share a meal with a friend, I think it's more worth it to share with someone than to take it home later. The price varies a lot so it depends what you wanna eat.

Intrigued by the buzz, we decided to visit Tandoori King Kitchen \u0026 Bar the following day.\n\nAmbiance: Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed by the waitress. The interior was inviting, with a cozy and intimate atmosphere that set the stage for a pleasant dining experience. The decor was tastefully done, reflecting traditional Indian aesthetics with a modern touch.\n\nFood:\n\nAppetizer\n\nPrawn Pakora\nMarinated in yogurt, ginger, and garlic, the prawn pakora was a delightful start to our meal. The prawns were large and perfectly crispy, with a well-balanced seasoning that enhanced their natural flavor. This dish was an excellent introduction to the restaurant’s culinary prowess.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nMains\n\nButter Chicken\nThe butter chicken featured boneless chicken pieces cooked in a rich butter sauce infused with ginger and garlic. The portion size was generous, making it good value for money. The chicken was tender and succulent, with a well-rounded seasoning that made the dish thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10\n\nLamb Korma\nThe lamb korma, cooked in a creamy cashew nut sauce, presented large, tender pieces of lamb. While the portion size was generous, the dish fell slightly short on seasoning, making it a bit bland for my taste. However, the quality of the lamb was commendable.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nService: Despite a minor hiccup with my drink order, the waitress was courteous and apologetic. Given the busy evening and the limited staff on the floor, the service was efficient and friendly.\n\nPrice: The meal offered excellent value for money, with generous portions and reasonable pricing.\n\nVerdict: Tandoori King Kitchen \u0026 Bar is a promising addition to the Richmond dining scene. The ambiance is charming, the food is generally impressive, and the prices are fair. Despite a few minor issues, our overall experience was positive, and we look forward to returning. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit for anyone craving authentic Indian cuisine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPha-Y-Gk9CP9P673GgpVn2KWnVfpOc2F8jqBcg\u0026fid=0x0:0x87b41a4fca1785ac""],""When"":""2024-7-19""},{""Name"":""Sujive Selvanathan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXKX9CrhN3TDPMBvR5Zb2ny2htnGQsn0PBQVFW-6FKovhhiqioi=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I ordered for a fish curry and garlic naan with vege samosa, food was delicious staff were sofriendly.

and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. The chef and staff were very friendly and talkative! I was delighted to try a new sake. I can confidently say this is the highest quality omakase I’ve had in Vancouver—better than the two Michelin-starred Japanese restaurants I’ve tried before. The only thing I think could be improved is that the flavors were a bit on the salty side. If they were a touch milder, it would better highlight the freshness of the ingredients.

The only negative side of the bathroom is the transparent glass door to the toilet; why not make it frosted allowing extra privacy? Still nice room overall.|The hotel features an all-year-round outdoor pool and hot tub on the 6th floor, which is a nice addition. Bruno's is their restaurant on the ground floor that offers breakfast and dinner, though check out CASK; a speakeasy intimate lounge that offers great whiskey and high priced food but worth it. Live music happens on Thursday and Sunday nights.|There's a rooftop bar on the 12th floor which was fun too.|It's not the Pacific Rim Hotel but this certainly gives Richmond a fancy hotel; a place to see the who's who and its worth checking out; not to mention being less expensive than the Fairmont alternative."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jason Reeson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWh-Y92ozUOY9zg0xrv6XBV11CnB_vozWUAEEtVxVTKZvxWlKY=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Thoroughly Loved our stay at the Versante Hotel.

Our server was very nice as well as all the staff working. Even though we ordered the two person set our server still gave us 3 desserts which was extremely appreciated. The restaurant is very big, there is music playing, it is a little cold and loud. All of the drinks are good! I recommend to get the classic cocktails over the signature ones as they're half the price and just as yummy.

restaurant is quite nice, with tasteful decor that creates a relaxing and comfortable setting, making it a great spot for dining with friends or family.

The bone marrow and steak combination was particularly unique—the beef was cooked to the right level, tender and juicy, and paired well with the crispy bone marrow, adding a rich texture. However, for those who prefer stronger flavors, there might be a desire for a bit more seasoning to enhance the taste.\n\nWe also ordered the seafood pasta. The pasta had a good texture, and the seafood tasted fresh, especially the shrimp, which was firm and enjoyable. The creamy sauce was rich and smooth, though it leaned slightly on the oily side. Overall, the flavor was satisfying, but it could be even better with a bit more balance in seasoning.\n\nAs for the pricing, it’s mid-range. We ordered around three dishes, and it came out to about $40 per person. Considering the ambiance and service, the price felt reasonable.

First off, there's no one at the front to welcome you , you kind've just walk in and sit until someone notices you. I went for a friend's birthday dinner and before we even ordered the waitress said that we can't split the bill because \""the server can't handle it\"" Even though you can just put all of our orders in one at a time to separate it. (We had a feeling that they didn't want to split it because it was 12 of us and having the bill altogether would have an auto gratuity of 18% instead of all of us tipping separately) We even asked again about splitting the bill,and she gave us a really hard time about it until we gave up on arguing about the bill. The food was okay, \""high quality\"" food at sort of affordable prices. Drinks were not really worth $15+ in my opinion, but they are pretty. As for my food, I got truffle fries to start and I can honestly say the ones at Cactus club are 100% better. Yes the fries are good but they just taste like regular fries with a hint of truffle and cheese on top. I got the scallop risotto for my main, the pumpkin risotto was yummy, the scallops over cooked and a bit rubbery but other than that it was good. I think it's a good place but not for a big group in my opinion, a few people yes so they don't rope you into auto gratuity.

I enjoyed when I saw servers or people with smiles. I love people with great manners and attitudes.\n\nWe seated right away and got some water to start with. We read the menus at home in advance so we knew what to order. We ordered tofu, unagi, and beef course meals. All of the course meals came with a bowl of miso soup, some veggies as side dishes, and the main dish (which was tofu, unagi, or beef) with rice. All of them had good quality but they were different from real authentic and sophisticated Japanese ones.\n\nThis is a family oriented restaurant so be expected that parents with little kids or older children would come here for meals. When we were dining here, a couple of kids cried very loudly and some ran around. As mentioned, the space was not big. A kid even bumped into my parent even though we were sitting and eating.

sushi restaurant. Solid 3.5/5.\n\nWe came for the first time on a Wednesday evening at 7pm. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, we never felt rushed. The food arrived quickly.\n\nThere are 3 AYCE menus available:\n\nBravo Menu (no sashimi): $29.95 adults \u0026 $15.95 kids ages 4-9\n\n4 pieces salmon or tuna sashimi included: $35.95 adults \u0026 $24.95 kids ages 4-9\n\nUnlimited sashimi included: $47.95 adults \u0026 $27.95 kids ages 4-9\n\nKeep an eye out for menu changes at the bottom. They add extra options and they're not on the order form.\n\nMy favourite dishes included the green salad, wakame salad, salmon nigiri sushi, special scallop cone, spicy tuna cone, smelt karrage and BBQ Mackerel.\n\nWe tried the $35.95 option and left satisfied. The food was fresh, and the portions were reasonable.\n\nSome dishes were too salty (salmon teriyaki, smelt karrage, seafood korroge). The oyster motoyaki was very disappointing. I'd avoid it.\n\nGood experience overall. Worth trying if you're craving all you can eat sushi. Easy to find, lots of free parking available."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMU7T8Onf8578LFypSGLV24xzd66eNvCJOeC7a_\u0026fid=0x0:0x711a5e4dea3802f0""],""When"":""2024-10-17""},{""Name"":""Rachel Keery"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW7HrRs2lYWD-a0OMwYD8hcg13jIWjm47WrdDcC3B391YGfNtPv3A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food was tasty.

But, if I am hungry or I want to hang out with friends, then I will go somewhere else."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPO8TtO5gxgFU8DJ4dW0LIXiiVJ4BARkds39KQH\u0026fid=0x0:0x5bda3765fe8f2710""],""When"":""2023-12-21""},{""Name"":""sng1002001"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLTfKdGFrJyL8jc4znhIMXimj1BkuJ1S_SEthxZmoeo2Gf8Rg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""If you like your shawarma to have a nice spicy kick, you come to the right place.
