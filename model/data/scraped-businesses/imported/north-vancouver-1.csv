Located within walking distance from the seabus, this lovely establishment went above and beyond to ensure my experience with them was top-notch.  My server Veronica was friendly and attentive, as well as the host/manager who took extra measures to ensure all my needs were met (my friends say Vadim goes above and beyond and deserves a shoutout too!).  I loved that the oysters were all meaty kuushis packed with fresh flavour.  Word of warning to those sensitive to spice: there is a little spicy kick to the cocktail sauce, so be careful when dipping your prawn cocktail!  Super tasty, though, to those who don't mind a flavourful kick to the palate.\n\nBread pudding I had to send back even though it was recommended as the best.  First time trying this dish as a dessert (closest thing Ive had before this was yorkshire pudding as an entree accomaniment) and I originally wanted the tiramisu, but the hostess mentioned either the chocolate cake/bread pudding stood out more for her personally.  While I loved the non-featured items of the plate like fresh fruit, salted caramel, and vanilla ice cream with the graham cracker crumb bottom, perhaps I'm simply not a fan of \""bread pudding\"" itself so the feature completely turned me off, and that's not the establishment's fault.  Reasons: weird consistency (half cooked/half doughy bread, kinda dry even with salted caramel drizzled on top, mine felt stale but i could be wrong since I have nothing to compare it to) with conflicting infused flavours.  This one had raisins/nuts, and the profile wasn't harmonious with everything going on the plate."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNXENBzpBtHj53YXiHsX0WJJIlYpAAxJQiMeOMf\u0026fid=0x0:0x46f34abd8e759908""],""When"":""2024-9-28""},{""Name"":""Azadeh Garshasbi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXSKv91Pi7o2_mQbbXgqbr5BSJDbhdVlEzNhFVj8FxdApwFCc4=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Seaside provisions is a fantastic spot for food lovers.

Most important thing, be prepared for an expensive meal. If you go in with any other expectation, you’re going to be disappointed. That is not a negative by any means it’s just an expectation. The service is top-notch and I would definitely like to give a call out to our server Morris, he was excellent and definitely added to the experience of the evening. The food was really good, lovely presentation, excellent flavours and cooked to perfection. My husband had the lamb and I had veal and they were both excellent. Just a heads up the lamb is spicy, which was unexpected and would’ve wrecked my dinner, but my husband said it was excellent. My husband had the testarossa cocktail and it was fun, definitely worth ordering for the presentation. It was a very busy night so we ended up being sat out on the patio, which we were hesitant about at first. It is very comfortable on the patio, warm and heated, our seat had a peekaboo of the ocean. You do need to be OK with people walking by but we enjoy watching people so that worked out fine. I have read some comments where people said it had an Italian “feel”. We personally don’t agree with this, the inside of the restaurant is very cold and does not have an old Italian restaurant feel at all. It is the total opposite decor of the restaurant that was there before which definitely captured the old Italian feel.  It’s very modern so we were happy to be put outside. Two suggestions, we found it kind of cheeky that we had to pay for bread at the table, considering the cost of all the other menu items and they definitely need to take the scented candles out of the little bathrooms. Haha I know this sounds weird, but it’s a small space and it was way too much smells."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM2VZuyd_BQ_mMg8a2lBeHPlzG08W6IzWL6Npk_\u0026fid=0x0:0x13823003b4dff702""],""When"":""2024-4-15""},{""Name"":""George Chatzivasileiou"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVvjVY_pLjYmxuEPhQ3w-uqtevJGoASxAG9o0qGG16ii5MmWAOn=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Loves the risotto - great flavour!

When my wife asked if the manager had been informed, the server said the manager was aware and \""sorry,\"" but there was no direct apology or acknowledgment from the manager. This lack of concern for hygiene and customer service is unacceptable and made for a very unpleasant dining experience.

As with any Joey location we’ve visited before, it’s upscale casual done right. The atmosphere is perfect, with a colour palette, furnishings, music, and lighting that are all on point. As with other Joey restaurants in our experience, they’ve also done an excellent job of choosing great staff – both the hostesses and our server Harrison were excellent.\n\nThe food was quite good. We started with the Scallop \u0026 Prawn Ceviche, the presentation of which was excellent, and even for someone like me who hates cilantro, it was awfully yummy. I can’t say for sure if the tortilla chips were made fresh in the back, but they sure tasted like it. As far as starters go, this one is a 10.\n\nWe followed that by sharing the Chicken Parmesan – not something we’ve ever ordered, and perhaps not as enticing as some of their other offerings, but we simply wanted something different. Despite not being big pasta eaters, we still really enjoyed the dish. Chicken is often overcooked, but they nailed it, and it was juicy and delicious. Nothing fancy or notable here, just a very serviceable version of a classic dish. If this is a dish you’re familiar with, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nWe always consider the restroom when rating a restaurant, and for the most part Joey did a great job ensuring it was clean and classy. Our only complaint was the absurdly awkward hand dryers. We both walked out of the restroom at the same time, looked at each other, and our first comment was about how we had to use the dryers from the side instead of how they're meant to be used – from the front. A small thing they could consider fixing.\n\nOverall a wonderful place to enjoy date night, with excellent service, good food, and a great atmosphere for enjoying time and conversation with your favourite human."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP6SNv5V8UxuErHGPWC-EBdzfIbGVyVOultsVsi\u0026fid=0x0:0xaaf02f9bd527580d""],""When"":""2024-10-13""},{""Name"":""Shahrzad Matin"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXr3Y2zjCIPyX_qS5DOamXBuLhPj_aJnaUF2sdw1Z1ZeFtoSqs=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Had a late lunch there today with my son.

The bowl features a delightful mix of fresh vegetables and a perfectly balanced dressing with just the right amount of spice.\n\nThe sushi cone, unfortunately, fell short of expectations. It was rather basic and lacked any distinctive flavor or impressive kick. I wouldn’t recommend ordering it; there are better options on the menu to explore.\n\nThe steak frites is also worth a try. While it may not be the best steak you've ever had, it's still quite enjoyable. I’d suggest taking advantage of the happy hour deals to get the most value.

However, my friends were disappointed with their meals, finding them lacking in flavor and too plain. While my noodle dish was enjoyable, it didn't quite justify the high price considering the portion size. It felt like this Korean restaurant deviated from the traditional experience I usually seek. One aspect I particularly appreciate in Korean restaurants is the variety of side dishes, but here they only provided three small ones, and we had to repeatedly request more kimchi.

We came in with eight people and the server looked already quite agitated that we came in with so many people, even though there were seats available.\n\nAlready sitting down, the restaurant forgot to give us utensils for the entire group, we had to ask on two separate occasions to provide us with the utensils.\n\nWhen it came to the meal we ordered the soondubu, bulgogi, japchae kimchi fried rice. The fried rice and bulgogi wasn’t terrible, just very salty. While the japchae never even made it out of the kitchen as the server had completely forgotten to even put it into the system. When it came to the soondubu, the soup came out and the visual was very unappetizing. Taking my first bite, a large clump of what looked like gum came out and it was very unsettling. When I asked the server what that was, she took it to the back and I was informed that it was a block of seasoning that was not dissolved. But to me, if a block of seasoning that big can make it into the dish, then it wasn’t cooked properly.\n\nThe server then asked me “what should they do about it”. Which perplexed me, because if a customer is complaining that their food that they know wasn’t cooked properly, the first course of action should be to replace. Also they never even bothered to apologize for the incident.\n\nThroughout the entire meal, the service was abysmal. When we would ask questions or need anything brought to the table, the server wouldn’t even respond and walk away. We would need to walk to the kitchen to order additional bowls of rice as the server had never came by to check on our meals.\n\nOverall, this was the worst experience I’ve had at a Korean restaurant in Vancouver, let alone worst experience at a restaurant in general.

The calamari was exquisite - perfectly fresh, the dipping sauce nicely matched - and a lovely balance of colours with peppers that made the presentation as good as the taste.\n\nNext up was my schnitzel.   Super!!!  Easily up to the standards of a German restaurant.  (I asked the waitress about it - it turns out, the chef recently immigrated from Germany, where he was a master chef. I have no doubt that, once he's saved up some money, he'll open a ultra high end restaurant rivalling the best in the city.  Meanwhile, this really is your chance to enjoy fine dining at a bargain price.)\n\nOne of the friends with whom I was dining had the butternut squash ravioli.  She commented the pasta was cooked al dente, to perfection, and the sauce was fantastic.   Topped with prawns that were apparently delicious as well.\n\nTrying to lose weight, but this place was too good to skip dessert.

From the moment my wife and I walked in, we were greeted with warm hospitality and a cozy ambiance. The star of our dining experience, however, was undoubtedly our fantastic waitress, Jacoba. Her attentive and friendly service truly enhanced our evening.\n\nOne of the highlights of our visit to Scratch Kitchen was undoubtedly the pizza. The moment our pizzas arrived at our table, we knew we were in for a treat. The flavors were out of this world, and the attention to detail was evident in every bite. The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside while remaining delightfully chewy on the inside. Each slice was generously topped with high-quality ingredients, creating a medley of flavors that danced on our taste buds.\n\nWhat impressed us even more was the restaurant's commitment to catering to different dietary preferences. My wife, being a vegan, was thrilled to find a variety of options tailored to her needs. Her vegan pizza was a masterpiece in itself, with a delectable combination of plant-based cheeses, fresh vegetables, and a flavorful tomato sauce. It's not easy to find vegan pizzas that taste this good, and Scratch Kitchen exceeded our expectations.\n\nBeyond the exceptional food, the atmosphere at Scratch Kitchen was warm and inviting. The rustic decor and cozy seating added to the overall charm of the restaurant. The staff members were attentive and friendly, and it was evident that they took pride in providing a memorable dining experience for their guests.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Scratch Kitchen to anyone seeking a remarkable dining experience. Whether you're a pizza lover or have specific dietary preferences, this restaurant caters to a variety of tastes and will leave you craving more. Make sure to request Jacoba as your waitress for exceptional service.

The spring roll is crispy and tasty relative to other Thai places. The red curry with beef was suggested, but the red curry didn’t have enough flavor and tasted too fatty and lacked that special touch. I had only two spoons and did not enjoy. The chicken cashew nut was good and was a generous portion and higher than usual number of cashew nuts. I appreciate they cut the cucumber Thai style in fried rice but didn’t try it so cannot comment (my friends order). In general I was happy with here. The curry was not was I was hoping for though and I hardly ate it/did not enjoy. The rest was good. In general one big drawback with this restaurant is that it is really dark and I never get a pleasant feeling walking in. I am very familiar with Thai food and the competition in Vancouver so 4 stars by me means it’s good. I’m considering taste and cost. The atmosphere is super super dark and would lower the score heavily if considered important. The personal experience I had was the service was good and thankfully they don’t charge or make a big deal for containers.\nBased on other reviews I would not try the pad Thai. Also I heard the owners are Chinese and thus not authentic but personally I have had Thai food that was really bad by Thai owners in Vancouver so that’s not what I consider."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMt--O-mHtmhzARPbHeAiXGnE4h1GQhqXjR7m7q\u0026fid=0x0:0x36b8f243dd8b10ab""],""When"":""2023-6-27""},{""Name"":""Yuen Man Chan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWT_q7sVSjzZETYsKUTINR0iUXRjPeUIedbgF9CysStAEsoqP21fA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The rice and noodles were the best; the sauce in the noodles was good.

There were about 5 other tables full here so there was still plenty of space.\n\nMy mom had the Super Avocado Eggs Benny while I had the Southwest Brunch Bowl which was like a Benny but without any meat. It was like a cross between Eggs Benny and a taco salad. We both had fresh orange juice to drink which was refreshing.\n\nMy mom enjoyed her Benny but was not able to finish the tasty potatoes so she took those home. I love eggs Benny so the Southwest Bowl was a fresh take on it. It had the poached eggs and potatoes like the Benny but the corn, black beans, avocado salsa, feta and mole gave it a completely different flavour which I loved! The thin, crispy tortilla strips added a nice crunch to the bowl.\n\nThe service was great as they periodically checked up on us.

Keon, the manager. professionally handled the complaint and went above and beyond to fix multiple issues I had regarding the service.\n\nInvited me back and saved a table for me on a busy weekend with a really great view. We’ve ordered the chicken spaghettini, steak frites, prawn cocktail and the pier 7 oyster trio. I didn’t really raise my hopes up, but this time it was a really great experience. The checkbacks were consistent, food was great (steak frites could’ve been more softer). The dessert was also pretty good. As a restaurant manager myself, this service recovery’s pretty good and again, Keon did a very great job.\n\nI’m just hoping that for my next visit, the service won’t change and be able to keep it consistent.\n\nThank you Pier 7.

The waitress was lovely and was a great caterer, but she did seem quite stressed, perhaps because it was a busy night. The food took a while to come but it was delicious. There was a lot of flavour in every bite. However, it might be best not to come with kids, as the food options were not very kid friendly (raw meat). For starters, I had the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, which was delicious, and my first taste of raw beef. As for the main, I had the Fraser Valley Turkey. It was a bit dry but still very tasty and filling.

The other meal that we ordered, the chicken looked like it was breaded and soggy. I was very disappointed. I’ve attached pictures for reference. I couldn’t go back to the restaurant to fix the issue as they would’ve been closed by the time I drove back to them."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPSjUxIPZnuuP42PUU_Ehacy7diVpt-D-xPO87D\u0026fid=0x0:0x6e2c938210a1abf""],""When"":""2023-12-29""},{""Name"":""Chairy Cheung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWIgb3-eKMpbc6ue-9iwe1cRFjqtJ9BoRbV9bBPdPp2zu7JAaTB=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good sushi.

She gave me a call, listened to my experience, relayed what she had learned after speaking to staff, apologized sincerely for our experience, and invited my friends and I back for a chance to make things right.\n\nWe returned to Anatoli's last night and everything was 10/10. The service was outstanding the food was wonderful—a complete 180 from our previous dining experience. Our server Tim was very attentive, friendly, and ensured we all had a good time.\n\nWe tried multiple dishes with everything tasting superb! (I wish we had taken more photos but we started eating as soon as the food arrived!) Our highlights were definitely the watermelon salad and the grilled humboldt squid.\n\nI understand mistakes can happen at restaurants and I believe a big indicator on a business' professionalism is how they try to make things right with the customer.\n\nGeorgia and her team went above and beyond to give us a true taste of what dinner at Anatoli's is like.\n\nWe will definitely be coming back!\n\n***\nAfter reading so many positive reviews and having this restaurant strongly recommended by close friends, I was so surprised to have experienced such awful service. Off the top, I want to say our issue was not with our server (who was great!) but with the kitchen. Our group of five waited 45 minutes for our mains (no appetizers were ordered) and one of our guests received her meal 10 minutes after everyone else's. The big issue though was that all of our food (rice, meat, and potatoes) were cold. When I brought this to the server's attention, she apologized, spoke to the kitchen and then shockingly returned to tell me that \""they don't believe me.\"" She said the kitchen staff had said plates can get cold while people wait to eat, so the plate was probably cold but not the food. I was stunned at this response as I wasn't trying to send my food back, just have it warmed up. I had tasted everything on my plate before speaking to the waitress and even asked guests at our table to confirm it was cold. The server was noticeably embarrassed and offered to take my plate back to be warmed up. After about five minutes the plate returned and the meat and rice were the exact same cold temperature and the potatoes had, at best, increased from cold to mildly warm. At this point, we were well over an hour into our dinner, my friends had been eating for 15 minutes, so I told the server the food was still cold but that I didn't want to wait any longer. She apologized profusely, said she would speak to the manager and when she returned she said they had offered to give us each a dessert. I felt it would have been more professional if the manager had come over to speak to our table personally but I appreciated the gesture. And it was not just our table experiencing issues with the kitchen. A table of eight directly beside us made multiple complaints about how long their food was taking and then had their mains arrive 10-15 minutes apart. The restaurant is gorgeous and our server was very professional but when you're charging $30 for a main, making guests wait 45 minutes, serving cold food, and then having your chefs openly dispute your claim that the food is cold and argue with their own staff, it leaves customers with a tremendously negative experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMFxCU5hTp7-ao8szjvj-dDoaESq78t9vmriKgQ\u0026fid=0x0:0x8778d34e1ec9df96""],""When"":""2024-6-13""},{""Name"":""Nadir Zulqernain (Broker Nadir)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWhEJmar-xPGvkChLjdSk0W2wzn9BfvbU7Rx_M524YyfDxob5mQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Anatoli Souvlaki at the Lonsdale Quay is a great spot for Greek food.

Once seated I got friendly service, however the food left much to be desired. I ordered the chilaquiles (divorced to try both salsas) and I've never been so underwhelmed by a version of this dish. The salsa was cold and tasted like it was from a bottle. Chilaquiles are supposed to be served hot after stewing the tortillas briefly in the hot salsa, and that was what I was expecting.

She had veal-stuffed cannelloni and I had the seafood special: prawns and scallops in a light sauce with vegetables.

The music background was loud enough for our server to only remember us when and another sever attended us. They may also take some basic Italian class. I had a tomato salad away by far from any Italian standard, the chicken with the mushroom was tasty with overcooked vegetables and soggy roasted potatoes.

Super glad to see them mostly keep the original layout and ambience of the place. Reception was pleasant and accommodating of my request for a booth inside (looking for AC on a 30c day!), as the inside was only about half full. Went right into menu and ordered one of of my go to items. Server C.K. was unsmiling and a bit snappy but I chalked it up to the heat and maybe a hectic lunch hour earlier. Food was great as always! However as I was looking to catch up with some work emails, server kept checking on me to ask curtly how the food was (the first couple times) and if I was done /needed a box which I thought was strange considering my food wasn’t even halfway done and I was there about half an hour. I’m quite mindful of overstaying, and I kept checking my watch as it was a late working lunch for me. One time she asked so loudly the customers at the next table couldn’t help but look at us. When done, I asked for the bill and because I felt the service was not up to par from my recollection, I lowered gratuity to 12% from the recommended 18%. I thought that was fair, given the food was great, reception and other staff were nice except my server. C.K. was not happy at all. She printed out my receipt, left it rolled on the table, quickly turned around and left in a huff without saying a word. Not judging her by this one incident, as she may have had a challenging day, but why take it out on your patrons? Not keen on going back in the future. Unpleasant experience today erased all the fun memories of this place for me.

The restaurant is an open space with minimal design, featuring extremely cheap decor and tables that don’t create a welcoming atmosphere. While it wasn’t dirty, it also wasn’t very clean, which added to the overall lackluster ambiance.\n\nFor the food, I ordered a mild hotness chicken burger with fries and a Coke. The presentation was very basic—fries were dumped in a basket with the burger on top, reminiscent of something you might get at a diner. The portion size was disappointing; the burger was quite small, and the fries were nothing special.\n\nThe chicken in the burger was thick and juicy, which was a plus, but the flavor left a lot to be desired. The “mild” hotness was overwhelming, and I’m someone who enjoys spicy food. It seemed like the heat was used to mask the blandness of the chicken. The burger itself was very basic—just the chicken and bread, with a tiny portion of coleslaw and a single slice of pickle drowned in condiments.\n\nEven the little things, like the ketchup packets and napkins, screamed cheap. The ketchup was in single-use packets like you’d find at a fast-food joint, and the napkins were the flimsy type you might see in a gas station restroom.\n\nOverall, Fryingpan Express for Hot Chicken seems to cut corners at every opportunity, which shows in both the service and food quality. I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re in a pinch and have no other options."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPrWnw_UQryGeGd16JMQ64crZ69r8IhOB4fEUxH\u0026fid=0x0:0x9cd2c350c480bbda""],""When"":""2024-8-16""},{""Name"":""Taylor"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLvTieCyaoAYyvUnI3OUHNKjWCcqK4N_iCIOFS8aC16shbIuw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Friendly staff with quick service.\n\nI had the chicken bits and waffles, the chicken was super crispy with lots of flavor.

It tasted like it came straight out of a dessert cafe instead of a chicken restaurant. The sides (potato and sweet potato fries) were salted to the extent where they weren't flavourless, but not too salty, right in the middle. They were very well done.\n\nThe burger had excellent portion (I am a heavy eater, and I was very pleased with how filling it was), and the chicken breast was tender and juicy. The burger was a perfect combination of chicken, relish, and the sauce also complimented the flavour well. I would recommend to order either the zero or mild spice level for others who don't necessarily handle spice well like myself. It didn't leave a greasy after taste at all, which is exactly what I seek in a chicken sandwich.\n\nMoreover, the chicken and waffles also offered great portion, and I was particularly impressed by the waffles. They were soft, and the vanilla cream was especially tasty and addicting, effectively balancing out the chicken flavour to go well hand in hand.\n\nIn addition, the staff were friendly, enthusiastic, while the interior offered a clean, spacious, and cozy atmosphere that accompanied the dining experience competently.

Some pieces of beef were harder and not tender.\n\nDinakdakan - I'm used to it being more mayo-y and white. The flavor was ok but different than other places.\n\nLechon - this is what you have to come for! This is the best that I have eaten here in the lower mainland. Often, the skin is too fried that it is hardened. This place is perfect. The meat is so tender too. We even ordered an extra side of it for $14.50\n\nPayment is cash or debit only. I should have paid attention when she was punching in the numbers because I only realized after that she charged me extra $1.50 for garlic rice when I only got plain rice.

Eclectic, fresh, great atmosphere and our server was funny, witty and engaging. I wish I’d asked her name but I will next time I go back, which is a guarantee!! The food was excellent! Rich, fresh….you could tell there was thought put into each dish \u0026 the process. I felt like I had stumbled across an incredible little restaurant in a small Italian village. To find a gem like this in North Van is amazing. I’ll be back again and again. Top picks: calamari, Caesar salad, squid ink seafood pasta, gnocchi \u0026 tiramisu.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The decor is modern yet cozy, making it an ideal spot for both intimate dinners and casual gatherings. We arrived during the opening hours, which allowed us to enjoy the space without the hustle and bustle that often comes later in the evening.\n\nThe service at Orto was exceptional. Our server was attentive without being intrusive, providing us with insightful recommendations that showcased the restaurant’s commitment to quality. Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece, reflecting the chef's dedication to using fresh, local ingredients. The presentation was stunning, and every bite was a celebration of flavor.\n\nOne standout dish was the bolognese which was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of seasoning. The accompanying Ceasar salad was vibrant and added a delightful crunch. Another highlight was the grilled calamari, which was tender and infused with a beautiful flavor that complemented the dish beautifully. Each plate was thoughtfully crafted, demonstrating not only culinary skill but also a passion for the art of cooking.\n\nThe location of Orto is another significant advantage. Nestled in a charming area, it’s easily accessible yet feels like a hidden gem. While parking can be a bit challenging, it’s worth the effort to experience the culinary delights that await inside. The ambiance is relaxed, making it a great place to unwind and enjoy a meal without feeling rushed.\n\nWhile dining, it was noticeable that the clientele shared a similar background, creating a unique community feel within the restaurant. This added to the overall experience, as it fostered a sense of connection among the guests. However, the atmosphere remained inclusive and welcoming to everyone.\n\nOverall, Orto is a restaurant that excels in every aspect. The combination of outstanding dishes, impeccable service, and a pleasant environment makes it a must-visit. Whether you’re a local or just passing through, this restaurant is sure to leave a lasting impression. I highly recommend making a reservation, as it’s bound to become a popular spot once word gets out about its incredible offerings.\n\nIn conclusion, if you’re looking for a dining experience that combines exquisite food with exceptional service, Orto is the place to be. From the moment you step through the door until the last bite of dessert, you are treated to a culinary journey that is both memorable and satisfying.

No taste at all on the noodles, and only thing you could taste is the spicy flavour. I am a believer of no-food waste and I usually dont leave any leftovers, but the 냉면 was so bad that I couldn't finish it. It was the worst one I had in my life pretty much.\n\nI have told the server after paying for everything, that the 냉면 needs to improve to be able to sell. Hope it gets better in the future, and I will give one more try ordering other dishes, and I really hope they are good, because this used to be my favourite restaurant before the menu change.\n\nQuestion to the restaurant: did the chef change along with the menu?\n\n2022 REVIEW:\n\nA great place for a Korean dinner over a wide selection of drinks on Lonsdale.\n\nCould feel a bit pricey, but the food definitely makes up for it. Some menus are not as common as the ones you see at a typical Korean restaurant, and it was exciting to see a few creative dishes. The staff was friendly, and they had variety of dishes for us to use for different type of food we ordered.\n\nIf you order the spicy stir fried squid, make sure to ask for the fried rice with a remainder sauce!\n\nStrongly recommended!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNGo3viVwmw0xk5vczAEReiowcGfUHcALxDz-df\u0026fid=0x0:0xea2e4bf47d5189f6""],""When"":""2022-8-13""},{""Name"":""Ian Bedford"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU_F6Ox9wo8tsLpIOSDDynb4iMk7zpEHee-hkr48D4FH1TjGO0=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Wife and I came to try Bukchon and will definitely return.

I think '2.5' stars would be extremely generous. My parter and I were deceived by the rating and decided to give this place a shot.\n\nThis has to be, hands down, the most sorry excuse for food in general (forget German food) I have ever seen or eaten in my life.\n\nThe soup of the day was a stodgy, sour, gluey mess that looked like something you'd get served if you were a prisoner of war. The \""stone ground freshly made bread basket\"" was a couple of dry pieces of brown toast that looked it was from No Frills.\n\nThe Swiss rosti was DRENCHED in oil. I'm not being hyperbolic, but there was oil oozing out of the pancake when I pressed into it with my fork, and a thick layer of oil swimming on the plate when I lifted the rosti to look underneath. The lettuce on top of the rosti was wilted, grey, wet, and cold. My partner ordered Schnitzel - it tasted like frozen food, extremely bland with cold sides.\n\nService was mediocre, aside from bringing us our plates of food from the kitchen with a smile, there wasn't much else by way of \""hospitality\"". The tablecloth and glasses were visibly stained and dirty. The ambiance was kitschy, gloomy, and stuffy.\n\n99.9% of the clientele here on the night we visited were MUCH older folk. I'm not sure if that's the reason for the high rating - really old people with barely any teeth left or working tastebuds probably love the stodgy and bland bits fried glue the restaurant is marketing as \""German food\"".\n\nNot surprised this place is open only 4 days of the week from 5- 9PM/10 PM. I'm surprised this place is still in business to begin with."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNWHQeFh305YxnZsfiymxxQoL0mE_27y-ZgJ7zs\u0026fid=0x0:0x653aba0057cf290a""],""When"":""2024-9-23""},{""Name"":""Connor Vadeboncoeur"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJbcvPAlRKn2JwLnXFmj0AHLwIektegOc-cSa_1fVF0vyn7Kg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Jägerhof is the absolute best restaurant you could ever experience.

Old school Bavarian style. There was also live performances inside that attracted our attention.\nStepping inside of the restaurant, the servers welcomed us very warmly. We went without a reservation at 5:00pm and at that time you didn’t need a reservation but you typically would on a Friday night so remember to book one.\nNow, onto the food. The food was amazing. We ordered a beer (Czech Dark Beer) and it went really well with the meats. We were sharing so we wanted to order a bit of everything. Out of the sausage platter, the venison sausage is a must-try. The Bratwurst also tastes very authentic and went very well with the beer. The Schnitzel was alright, but the mushroom sauce elevated it to a 10/10 immediately- the sauce is a must try. The Ham was a bit salty but paired well with the Sauerkraut and the beer. The third dish was the Schweinshaxe, but it kind of disappointed . The portion is of average/smaller size, and skin was not as crispy as we’d like it to be. However, the meat was very juicy and paired amazingly well with the sauce and Sauerkraut. Perhaps it was because we were in a rush and we kind of rushed the kitchen (the Schweinshaxe would usually take 20 minutes. Ours was in 15 ish). It still tasted great nevertheless.\nIf you come here next time, definitely try the mushroom sauce (Jager?) and the schnitzel. Also get the dark beer with the meat (per server recommendation) and the venison sausage. If you have enough time , try the Schweinshaxe."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNcA22JgLyKa7Dd1Gs6TfoxRkPWaqjphSqaK63R\u0026fid=0x0:0x653aba0057cf290a""],""When"":""2024-8-3""},{""Name"":""P W"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLI37t952iZSoPgizcFdjgFO2xcncgGmbkV0YMBQVxa95wEHg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The food was astonishing, the service top notch and the atmosphere fun.

My partner enjoyed Hokkaido Scallops with squash tortellini, sage butter sauce, and toasted walnuts. Scallops are easily overcooked but these shellfish well prepared. I had Sockeye Salmon Wellington and while the salmon was well cooked, the phyllo pastry was roasted beyond flaky. It was like a hard cracker. Overall though, the dinner was worthwhile.\n\nDessert was also mixed. Partner enjoyed crème caramel but the meringue in my Strawberry Pavlova was inedible. Undissolved sugar gave it the taste and mouthfeel of a sugar cube. When I indicated dissatisfaction, an alternative dessert was offered and the Pavlova was removed from our bill. The server and the manager responded to my remarks in a thoroughly professional manner. Flaws happen in restaurants but the strength of a dining room is determined by how well the staff responds. Fishworks did that well. We will not hesitate to return."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMteKlvYqdtxie71RCWe05mczGG2Ifdi3PQ_VGW\u0026fid=0x0:0xfd5d9cc981c7faad""],""When"":""2024-11-5""}]",

However, even she and I found the cheese to be a bit of a turnoff this time.\n\nThe pizza on the other hand could have done with a bit more cheese on it. We love ooey, gooey, stretchy cheese but there was no \""cheese pull\"" to be had with these pizzas.\n\nAside from the cheese being too much or too little, we loved the food here. My husband said his Calabria Pizza was very tasty. My daughter and I enjoyed the flavor of the Margherita Pizza, and we all loved that the pizzas had a nice, crispy crust.\n\nEarlier this year we had dined nearby at another pizza \u0026 pasta restaurant where the pizza crust had been quite disappointing so we were over the moon when we discovered how crispy the pizza crust was at Bufala.\n\nThere were these three bottles on the table. Each one contained a different flavor of oil which the server told us was meant to be eaten with the pizza. The green oil was a Rosemary Herb flavored oil, and this same oil had been on top of our Tuscan Bean Dip. We loved this oil! It tasted awesome on the Tuscan Bean Dip and wonderful with the pizza as well.\n\nSpaghetti and Burrata was by far, my favourite dish of the evening. It's described as having  kale pesto, Italian burrata and toasted pumpkin seeds on it; I was very sure that I could also taste lemon in it although lemon wasn't mentioned on the menu.\n\nThis place is my new favourite for pizza \u0026 pasta on the North Shore, and I very much hope to dine here again sometime!\n\nService: Good\nParking: Free parking on the street\nLocation: 3280 Edgemont Blvd., North Vancouver"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipObCjhbk6DTklj5zuZLyhDdCubyJu9KTOna8SME\u0026fid=0x0:0xd63af9ffdfa7acd""],""When"":""2023-10-27""}]",

The grapefruit in it definitely gave it a pop of colour, and while grapefruit isn't exactly my favourite fruit when it comes to taste, I did enjoy the juiciness of the fruit.\n\nI ordered the Grille Pizza which came with marinara sauce, mozzarella, roasted eggplant, roasted red pepper, zucchini, fresh parsley and chili oil.

When I eat anything with eggplant on it, I always prefer my eggplant to be cooked until it has become very soft.\n\nMy daughter however ordered the exact same pizza as me, and for some reason the veggies were not as soft on her pizza; so while I very much enjoyed my food I think this restaurant needs to work a bit on consistency since my daughter's pizza wasn't quite as enjoyable as mine.\n\nService: Good\nParking: Free parking on the street\nLocation: 115 15th St., North Vancouver, BC"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNW55Jk43ZnmtT7Gi4igL_fAK_6ZvolshYvlLQz\u0026fid=0x0:0x5f22477537727e6d""],""When"":""2024-5-8""},{""Name"":""Guillaume Bourassa"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUv5-8qIsaut-K6utIhDeGMPbJTZOfr1s0gwe_bvTCBfNFlG4y9=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food was incredible.

The burger was pretty disappointing—just a thin beef patty with basic toppings and pretty pink in the middle which it’s not food safe in British Columbia. I’d give it a 5 out of 10. When the bill came, I was shocked to see $19 for the burger, $9 for some McCain frozen fries, and $12 for the wine (which was the price for a 9 oz serving, not the 6 oz I got). $30 burger is normal for fine dine restaurants when you get a thick patty with homemade truffle fries and a 5 star service but for some frozen meal this was absolutely disgusting.\n\nOverall, I felt blindsided and misled by the prices for such a mediocre meal.

During our visit, we experienced a variety of items, each showcasing different aspects of the restaurant’s culinary approach. While the meal had its highlights, some dishes left room for improvement.\n\nService:\nUpon arrival, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated without delay. The service throughout the meal was attentive and friendly, with our waitress making sure we were well taken care of. This level of hospitality certainly enhanced the dining experience.\n\nRating : 8/10\n\nFoods:\n\n•\tTako Wasabi:\nThe Tako Wasabi featured seasoned octopus paired with a hint of wasabi. The balance between the savory flavors of the octopus and the sharp kick of wasabi was well-executed. However, the accompanying seaweed portion was somewhat sparse, limiting its potential as a balanced side element. Despite this minor shortcoming, the dish was enjoyable and satisfying.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tJL Poke Bowl (Brown Rice \u0026 Avocado):\n\nThe poke bowl, featuring brown rice and avocado, was underwhelming. While the ingredients were fresh, the portion was smaller than expected, and the overall flavor profile lacked the depth found in similar dishes at other establishments. There was nothing particularly memorable about the dish, and it didn’t stand out amidst the other offerings.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\n•\tLonsdale Crossing Roll:\nThis roll combined prawn and yam tempura with cream cheese and crab meat, topped with avocado and a special house sauce. The flavors were rich and well-balanced, with the creaminess of the avocado and crab working harmoniously with the crispy tempura. The special sauce added a delightful finishing touch, making this one of the more successful dishes of the evening.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tKatsu Don:\nThe Katsu Don, featuring deep-fried breaded pork and egg served over rice with Japanese soup stock, was another strong dish. The pork was perfectly fried, maintaining a crisp texture while remaining tender inside. The seasoning was well-balanced, and the dish as a whole was comforting and flavorful.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tOyster Motoyaki:\nUnfortunately, the Oyster Motoyaki was the least enjoyable dish of the night. The dish was overly dominated by mayonnaise-based sauce, which masked the flavor of the oysters. Compared to similar offerings at other Japanese restaurants, this rendition was disappointing. The portion was served in a platter-style presentation, and the overall taste failed to impress.\n\nRating: 4/10\n\nAmbiance:\nThe ambiance of JL Sushi \u0026 Kitchen is functional but not particularly remarkable. While the space was clean and comfortable, there was nothing about the decor or atmosphere that stood out or elevated the dining experience. It’s a suitable spot for a casual meal, but it lacks the visual or experiential elements that might make it more memorable.\n\nPrice:\nThe prices were reasonable given the quality and quantity of food. While some dishes didn’t quite meet expectations, the pricing was in line with similar restaurants in the area, making it an affordable option for those seeking Japanese cuisine.\n\nVerdict:\nOverall, JL Sushi \u0026 Kitchen provides a decent dining experience, with a few standout dishes alongside some that could use improvement. The service was a definite highlight, and the reasonable pricing makes it a viable option for those in the area. While there were some disappointments, particularly with the Oyster Motoyaki, I would consider returning to explore more of the menu, especially given the quality of the Katsu Don and Lonsdale Crossing Roll."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP5Oh7RTFBdyeUWPm-wxLwQippuMA9bLnbi7hVu\u0026fid=0x0:0x54af63e105f36f8a""],""When"":""2024-9-17""},{""Name"":""Chloe Genargue"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWcB97SzXsMD6panoq_G9yq28plXwWkj0h7AznJw7Xc37ypMfg5=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""A few blocks away from where I work.

Some things were missed or wrong but they did give us a free dessert as an apology, which was nice. Overall the steak bulgogi was really well cooked and I would order it again.

While running some final errands before heading to the airport, I decided to check out this well-known restaurant which has been in business on the Northshore for many years, and was known as \""Kypriaki Taverna\"" in its former nearby Marine Drive location.\n\nThe restaurant is open daily between 12 - 9pm, and has both lunch + dinner menus. On-site customer parking is also available in a lot behind the building.  Kypriaki Mediterranean Grill is located mid-block near the northwest corner of Marine Drive and Bridgman Avenue and nearby Pemberton Plaza.\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant at noon opening, we received a really great welcome.  The lunch menu was in effect with many really tasty options. I chose the generously portioned baked Italian lasagna, while the family friend had the chicken souvlaki, with rice pilaf, and Greek salad.\n\nGreek cuisine is their speciality, and they are well-known for their tasty  Roast Lamb, Moussaka and Beef/Chicken Souvlaki, as well as Spanish Paella . Classic rich Greek  desserts like Baclava and Bougatsa are also on offer, and not to be missed.\n\nThe interior restaurant space has a great casual Mediterranean vibe: think light ochre + blue accented walls, landscape canvasses on wall / plants,  country - wood furniture, and overall warm rustic charm.\n\nThere is also a sports bar/lounge side of the restaurant with tables/comfy chairs, bar-stools, and 3 big-screens showing football/hockey games. Their daily Happy Hour drink/food specials runs between 4 - 5pm.   During Spring/Summer  there is an outdoor patio area along the front of the restaurant.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual Greek -  Mediterranean restaurant with longstanding reputation and delicious food at reasonable prices, you definitely have to check out Kypriaki."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPxOfFIjSqhLEMKiydwG22gkC4CleoBZ_LarrtG\u0026fid=0x0:0x67e12243d5a5f6c2""],""When"":""2024-11-12""},{""Name"":""R M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX_fz1ppRTsIp4sjPAQMlDnN0i9UFP0hSxVQWeP4OaNSz_YsQXRew=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""First time dining at Kypriaki Restaurant, and we had such a great time!

Speaking of Koobideh! You guys indeed serve the best Koobideh!!! Not only famous and popular in town but also my family who visit from Iran always ask me to take them to Gilaneh for their Koobideh.

The service is excellent when it not too busy, but I would say when its busier, its hard for the staff to catch up with tables and good service. I also advice bringing onion with Kebab or in order to make sure it wont waste, ask the guests if they want extra onion on the side. The hot bread serves before food would have been more tasty is served with butter..... The music however is laud and sometimes nostalgic in a sad way. Please choose a nicer playlist and turn it down a bit then I would give 5 star for atmosphere!\nAnyways, I go to Gilaneh almost every week.

The flavors were bland, and the tortillas weren’t as fresh as I expected. My girlfriend tried their margarita, and it was nothing special—just average, really.\n\nThe biggest issue, though, was the way they handled the drinks. They don’t tell you what brand of alcohol is being used, and all the bottles were covered. It made us feel really uncomfortable, not knowing what kind of alcohol was going into the drink. It came off as shady and unprofessional, and it definitely ruined the experience for us.\n\nOverall, I won't be returning.

Raising the price at least 30% and giving only 2 sizes that they’re almost half of what it used to be, it’s not making the place better. It makes it only more profitable!!!!!\nThe place is very sad and seems very slow. I’m not writing this review to make you feel bad. I just want you to know that there are too many changes that they made this place to look and feel super greedy.\nLeave the fact that the taste is not the same. It still good soup. Look at the sizing that’s a whiskey glass, you put only 1/3 of the amount of the chicken in the chicken soup. Very disappointing. I heard it from other regulars that they said that it’s not the same and it’s a sad place and I could understand because of the circumstances. This place used to have a lineup all the time.

Where do I start? First incident: pick up my order, get in my car, check my order and find a shrimp dish which I didn’t order but missing my beef dish. I went back inside and told the son of the owner about the mistake. He said I ordered it so I need to keep it but I can buy an extra beef dish. I explained to him I didn’t order this dish and would NEVER, EVER,  order a shrimp dish as my son is allergic to shrimp. I suggest he might have made a mistake with another customer’s order. He said that he did not and that was on my order. I argued with him and he finally change it for my beef dish.\n\nSecond incident: Went back because there is not much choice for Chinese food in North Van. Well, bad decision! Pre-ordered my meal ahead of time because I needed to pick up my son at soccer then drop off the food at home with my son, and drive my other son to hockey. When I got to the restaurant, the owner told me my husband already picked up my order which he didn’t. It turned out they give my order to another customer so they have to make mine from scratch again. The owner, her daughter and the cook started screaming at each other in Chinese about the mix up.\n\nI had to tell them to stop arguing, do it when I am gone, and to hurry to prepare my order……. I had to come back in 20 min which made me late for my son, the other one drop off, etc. The best/worse part…… I finally came back to pick up my order and I asked for a discount on my meal (they didn’t offer) as their mix up caused me a lot of hassles. The owner offered few dollars off. I said the inconvenience they caused me worth much more than few dollars and that their customer service was sub par. I told they have no business etiquette.\n\nThe 18 yo daughter joined the discussion and told me I was insensitive to their business! Who made the mistake? I told them that they should assume their mistakes and not make the such a big deal about it. The daughter got upset and told me to get in my car.

Staff make an effort to remember you, they’re always friendly, quick to serve, and make sure you have everything you need while you enjoy a meal.\n\nSushi5 is my first choice when I crave Teriyaki or Udon Soup. The Udon Soup is loaded with thick noodles, broth, a variety of veggies, and meat or tofu. Their broth is by far the best I’ve had in comparison to other sushi places on the North Shore; it’s packed with flavor, yet not too salty. I’ve tried all Teriyaki (beef, chicken, tofu), all are perfectly seasoned, loaded with veggies, rice, meat, and come with miso soup. Their tempura is above average (in my opinion), because it’s a thin batter, so while you enjoy the flavor of the prawns or vegetables, they aren’t heavy or greasy. The quality and quantity is better than many places, which is why I keep coming back!\n\nSpecial Rolls here are a tad underwhelming, but the basics are delicious and fresh (Veggie Roll, Wild Salmon Roll, Spicy Wild Salmon, Wild Salmon Avocado, Prawn Tempura Crunch Roll).\n\nAtmosphere: clean, inviting, not too loud even when busy, seats are comfy.

From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was enveloped in an ambiance of warmth and sophistication, setting the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.\n\nLet's start with the star of the show—the sushi itself. AFC Sushi showcases an impeccable display of skill and craftsmanship in every piece of sushi they create. Each bite is a testament to the fresh and high-quality ingredients used, resulting in an explosion of flavors that dance on the palate. The attention to detail is truly remarkable, from the perfectly seasoned rice to the precise cuts of fish. Whether it's the classic nigiri, the artfully rolled maki, or the delicate sashimi, every item on the menu is a testament to the mastery of the sushi chefs at AFC Sushi.\n\nOne aspect that truly sets AFC Sushi apart is their unwavering commitment to sourcing sustainable and responsibly harvested seafood. They actively partner with suppliers who prioritize eco-friendly fishing practices, ensuring that the delicate balance of our oceans is preserved. This dedication to sustainability not only showcases their environmental consciousness but also provides diners with the assurance that they are enjoying sushi that is ethically sourced.\n\nThe menu at AFC Sushi is a testament to creativity and innovation. While they have an impressive selection of traditional sushi options, they also introduce unique and exciting flavor combinations that push the boundaries of traditional sushi-making. From signature rolls to fusion-inspired creations, every dish offers a delightful surprise for the taste buds. The incorporation of fresh herbs, sauces, and inventive toppings adds an extra layer of complexity and excitement to the dining experience.\n\nIn addition to the exceptional sushi, AFC Sushi offers a range of appetizers and sides that are equally impressive. From the light and crispy tempura to the comforting and flavorful miso soup, each dish is thoughtfully prepared to complement the sushi offerings. The diverse menu ensures that there is something to please every palate, and the quality and taste of each dish are consistently outstanding.\n\nThe service at AFC Sushi is impeccable, with a staff that is not only knowledgeable but also genuinely passionate about sushi and ensuring that guests have a memorable experience. From the moment you enter the restaurant to the final goodbye, the attentive and friendly staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and well-cared for. Their recommendations are spot-on, and they are always ready to provide any assistance or answer any questions you may have.\n\nThe restaurant itself is beautifully designed, with a modern and elegant aesthetic that creates a refined yet inviting atmosphere. The attention to detail in the decor is evident, from the sleek sushi bar to the comfortable seating arrangements. Whether you're dining alone, on a date, or with a group, AFC Sushi provides a comfortable and sophisticated setting that enhances the overall dining experience.\n\nLastly, I must highlight the incredible value that AFC Sushi offers. Despite the exceptional quality of the food and the attention to detail, the prices are incredibly reasonable. This allows diners to indulge in an extraordinary sushi experience without straining their wallets—a rare find in the world of sushi restaurants.\n\nIn conclusion, AFC Sushi is a true gem for sushi enthusiasts. The combination of exceptional sushi craftsmanship, sustainable sourcing practices, attentive service, and elegant ambiance create a dining experience that is second to none. I wholeheartedly recommend AFC Sushi to anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary adventure that will leave them craving more."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jinpyung Kim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXffi-fBFqDsRHqnZVhEbIzQOU0otRrUFOzyB0vijm4TL68qO1O=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Really really great sushi and service was super cheerful and friendly.\n(and reasonable price!)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNimaYNATgLRR1qebh-NYq903Gd6gbXHztJBMOI\u0026fid=0x0:0xfd0eae1b1d306bec""],""When"":""2021-7-17""},{""Name"":""S C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLHLCGPwY5YsLO8AT9mXCgGhw_r525VpEnc4AKKIDm42jxExQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Their sushi is top quality you can expect.

It adds a fantastic touch to the pizza and allows you to customize each slice just the way you like it. Plus, they have a variety of other condiments available, which is a nice bonus.\n\nI also loved their selection of different pops from the USA and Italy. It’s great to have unique beverage options that you don’t find everywhere. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot for a casual meal with friends or family.\n\nOverall, Captain Oven Pizza never disappoints, and I can't wait to return for another round of their amazing pizza and excellent service!

As a fellow risk-taker in life's culinary adventures due to seafood allergies, I dared to venture into this quaint establishment, and I'm glad I did.\n\nFood Quality (5/5):\nEach bite of the Avocado roll, Cucumber Roll, and Veggie Roll was a testament to the chef's dedication to perfection. The rice, cooked to just the right consistency, cradled fresh, vibrant vegetables that were a delight to the palate. Not a hint of browning or toughness, a common pitfall in many rushed sushi joints.\n\nPrice-Value Ratio (4/5):\nWhile prices may tilt towards the higher end compared to nearby alternatives, the superior quality justifies every penny spent. When it comes to sushi, I firmly believe that quality should never be compromised for the sake of savings.\n\nAmbiance (4/5):\nSimplicity meets style in Sushi Kumo's ambiance. Though modest, the decor exudes a certain charm that complements the dining experience.\n\nService (3/5):\nUnfortunately, the otherwise stellar experience was marred by lackluster service. The pace was sluggish, with no check-ins to inquire about our needs. Water and tea remained unrefilled, a disappointing oversight that detracted from the overall enjoyment. It was disheartening to observe preferential treatment towards certain patrons, a stark contrast to the egalitarian spirit of hospitality.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nDespite the service hiccup, Sushi Kumo remains a gem worth revisiting. For vegetarian sushi aficionados seeking impeccable quality, this is the place to be.

We are two busy professionals that like to eat healthy. We used to spend 1 day every weekend meal prepping for the entire week leaving very little time for us to unwind and socialize. We felt that this was a cost to pay if we needed to stick to certain nutritional diet and and if we're on a budget. We did try other services that provide groceries and recipes and found those less efficient and more costly and not as healthy. For us the answer has been Holly food. The team is very flexible from customizing your orders to delivery method and time. The meals are always in good quality, fresh and healthy. They have lots of menu options, so if you are vegan, on a veto diet or a balanced diet you will always find the right choice for you on their menu, and even then if you get tired of it, they can customize for you to add an extra layer of variety...\n\nI highly recommend that you give them a try.  you'll get your weekends back to do whatever you need to do to rest and enjoy!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Something for everyone.\n\nThe interior of Yummy Donair's very  ideal corner location on 16th Street is bright and clean with curving stone counters along window, several  individual tables for four, and new seating both inside and outside; the adjacent outdoor patio seating area  is surrounded by shady trees and shrubs along Hamilton Avenue, ideal for hot Summer weather.

This is such a tough review! I hate to give such low stars but the owners need to PAY attention!! Starting from bad to good. The drinks, um no drinks list? No wine list? Come on! You have a beer and wine store right next door. I will add that the bartender (who is awesome btw and is in my pictures because I didn’t get his name) said he was redoing the wine list. The wine is yuck but hopefully they will bring in some options. The food, cringey… if you can’t even get a hamburger figured out and you are a pub, there needs to be some changes!! The beef dip had a chance if it had some flavour like a horseradish mayo or something!! I will say the pork rinds on the appetizer list is surprisingly good! Parking sucks! Just walk, honestly. Now what you have been waiting for THE GOOD:  first off, the STAFF. They are great, super helpful and friendly. This was a busy hockey playoff night and they were great. 5+ stars for the staff!! (We have been here on a not as busy afternoon and the service was a bit questionable but the server was really friendly and sweet) all in all I really feel like the staff is so nice. LOCATION: this is a great location and a really nice atmosphere. The seats are comfortable, it’s a nice layout, lots of room, pool tables, darts, karaoke and lots of TVs for sports. COME ON OWNERS step up your game make the food and the drinks list better and you will get a better midweek crowd as well as a better weekend following. Add some live music, good North Shore Bands \u0026 not just karaoke, to this and it will be pure gold!!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMA6465-BJxUnUU6i3NjZ7WO27O5Krb5MwG0xlh\u0026fid=0x0:0x4b43047cad7f80c2""],""When"":""2024-5-1""},{""Name"":""Munro Stuff"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWj0Wcuk6ox5dfAeJ4fAaMbhX_F-nzzt3p5oc_f0hBd0NpbGSM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Had a pretty good visit here - amazing to have a pub with this view!

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm and friendly atmosphere, setting the tone for what was to come.\n\nThe highlight of the entire experience was, undoubtedly, the food. The dishes we ordered were nothing short of amazing. Each bite was bursting with authentic Vietnamese flavors, leaving us all craving for more. The menu offered a wide variety of choices, catering to both meat lovers and vegetarians, and everything was cooked to perfection. Whether you are a fan of traditional pho or eager to try some exotic Vietnamese delights, Pho Japolo will not disappoint.\n\nIn addition to the fantastic food, the service was commendable. The staff was attentive and courteous, making sure our needs were met promptly. We didn't have to wait long for our orders to arrive, which is always a plus when you're hungry and eager to indulge in delicious cuisine.\n\nThe restaurant's ambiance was clean and comfortable, providing a cozy setting for a memorable dining experience. While it might not be the most opulent place, the simplicity and neatness added to the charm, allowing us to focus on what mattered most: the incredible food.\n\nAffordability is another major plus point for Pho Japolo. Despite the high quality of their dishes, the prices were reasonable and did not burn a hole in our wallets. The value for money was exceptional, making it an excellent option for both casual outings and family gatherings.\n\nParking can be a headache in busy areas, but Pho Japolo had us covered. The presence of parking space in both the front and back of the restaurant made it convenient for us to find a spot without much hassle.\n\nWhile the overall experience was fantastic, there was one minor downside that deserves mention. The area behind the restaurant seemed neglected, with puddles of dirty water and a lack of maintenance. It was a contrast to the cleanliness and attention to detail inside the establishment. A small effort in maintaining the outdoor space could go a long way in enhancing the overall impression of the restaurant.\n\nIn conclusion, Pho Japolo Vietnamese Restaurant is a gem for any lover of Vietnamese cuisine. The amazing food, good service, reasonable prices, and convenient parking make it a must-visit. With a bit more attention to the outdoor area, it would truly be an all-around exceptional dining destination. I would gladly return for another delightful meal and recommend it to others without hesitation."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOXenPPmkKaHO6IwYEiR4BmewuCLqqrDlAOlBb5\u0026fid=0x0:0xd72efcb474855faa""],""When"":""2023-7-31""},{""Name"":""Josephine Ma"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW4ctBP8R2rm9S8Aa5NyuULMapTvyTQYakS6AvI9Cd025oSy86H=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Pho Japolo has been around for quite a number of years.

I used to love pizza garden and I was excited for this treat  (I say treat because let's be honest they are on the pricey range of what pizza should cost)\nfirst off, ordering was a bit chaotic, the girl on the phone seemed confused, forgot to tell me how long it would take for my pick up etc. but hey we all were new at some job sometime so i didn't think too much of it.\nwhen we got there (at the time we were told the pizza was gonna be ready) we were rudely told it was not ready and that we would have to wait at least 15 minutes. so after talking with them (felt more like arguing) they realized they got confused in our order and it was indeed ready to pick up.\nall this would have been a small inconvenience if the meal would have had worth it but unfortunately the whole inside of the pizza was soggy, i dont know if it wasn't cook enough or if they just put super wet ingredients on it but it was honestly really unpleasant to eat. half of every slice were wet. So for that price ill definitely go somewhere else next time im craving pizza.\n\nEDIT : they offered us a free pizza which we ordered this weekend and it was a better quality. thank you for making it right"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Nafiseh Nouri"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLm9iqmZ4JZiovzRTGACAP-ZSLp6AmWPJiCT6sIbOsF2oJrGw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I tried their Quattro Formaggi many times.

you’re looking for oversized and unique rolls, this might be your place!\n\nService: staff are always welcoming and kind, promptly take food orders, and the food tends to arrive fairly quickly.\n\nPersonal Favorites: Salmon Cone, Yam and Mushroom Roll, John’s Roll, and the Spicy Mayo has a slight undertone of sweetness, which levels it up in comparison to others. They offer a large variety of vegan and vegetarian rolls, which is a nice change from typical veggie rolls.\n\nFood Quality: I hate to say it, but I’ve noticed the quality of their food has been inconsistent in recent months, which is why I procrastinated posting a review. One day, the salmon was great, then a week or two later, the salmon was chewy, and this has happened a few times now. I hope it was a temporary glitch and that things improve, because it’s a shame.\n\nOverall: nice atmosphere, isn’t too loud; however, it can get packed during peak meal times, so be prepared!

Walking into your cafe is like stepping into a vibrant garden of edible delights, and I must say, I'm still floating on cloud nine from my last visit!\n\nLet's talk about the \""Nut-thing Better Acai\"" bowl first. If this bowl were a movie, it would sweep the Oscars. Picture this: a heavenly heap of organic acai, with banana and blueberries so fresh you’d think they just took a dip in the Fountain of Youth. And the star of the show? That decadent organic peanut butter sauce cascading over an A-list cast of banana, strawberries, kiwi, with a cameo of chia pudding, cacao nibs, and homemade granola that deserves its own spin-off series. Each spoonful was a blockbuster hit in my mouth!\n\nMoving on to the Tofuino Salad—this isn't just any salad; it's a crunchy, colorful carnival of joy! The kale was so tender it must have been hand-reared from infancy, and paired with the smoky tofu, it was like a sultry tango of flavors. The supporting cast of carrots, radish, and purple cabbage added just the right amount of crunch, making every bite a standing ovation.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the Grilled Please Sandwich. With its sunflower pesto and zen cheese, it's the kind of sandwich that brings peace talks to the table. It’s like if world leaders sat down and shared this sandwich, global harmony would be achieved before dessert.\n\nBuddha Full, you’re not just a cafe; you're a culinary utopia. Your plant-based prowess is turning this meat-eater into a frequent leaf-eater. Bravo, and see you soon—my taste buds insist on an encore!\n\nYours in veggie and fruit-filled delight,\n\nRuben"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP9SHoibPko_Itxrk79u3a907eXoAMmyrwogrr4\u0026fid=0x0:0x69f7141f6183455f""],""When"":""2024-4-29""},{""Name"":""Chloe Genargue"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWcB97SzXsMD6panoq_G9yq28plXwWkj0h7AznJw7Xc37ypMfg5=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Something I don’t take for granted is this go-to place before I head to work a few blocks away.

We ordered the Mongolian beef and beans, which were supposed to come with garlic, but didn't. The beans tasted old and stale, like they had been sitting around forever before being served. It felt like they had been in exile, and someone finally decided to throw them on a plate. The beef was slimy and tasted awful, like it had been left out for days.The spicy chicken with spinach was equally terrible, as if whoever cooked it was in a bad mood and decided to take it out on the food.\n\nThe rice they served us looked like it had been scraped from the bottom of the pot—dry, scaly, and burnt. The spicy chicken with spinach was just as bad, clearly cooked by someone who didn’t care at all about what they were doing. It was far from authentic, despite what they might want you to believe.\n\nWhen we spoke to the owner, Selena, about our concerns, she couldn’t have cared less. She rolled her eyes as if she was used to hearing complaints and just didn’t care. Her attitude was beyond dismissive—like she thought she was above everyone else.\n\nFor the record, this place used to be packed on a Saturday night, and now, it’s almost empty. If you look at the reviews, it’s clear that Selena has issues and is in denial about the problems here. She refuses to fix what’s broken and bring the restaurant back to its former glory.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. In fact, I’ll be filing a report with the health authorities because someone needs to hold this owner accountable. Running a restaurant means providing quality food and a decent dining experience—neither of which you’ll find at Red Chilli. Avoid this place at all costs.\n\nThere’s nothing authentic about this restaurant. In fact, it’s far from it. The decor is low-class and pungent, and the owner? Let’s just say they should be ashamed. The only redeeming factor was our server, who was polite and clearly just doing their job. I’ll be initiating a report with the health inspector because this place needs it.

We needed to ask multiple times for water and chopsticks. But these happenings were minor and we were not too upset about them.\n\nSome time after we ordered we had been told the wifi wasn’t working and therefore had to pay cash. Fortunately, my mother had some on her so this was no problem.\nAfter eating, we paid with the limited cash we had, $105 dollars in total for a $95 order. This was what we had on us. When the server lady came to get the bill she counted the money at our table and said, “What? Only 10%?” She left clearly frustrated and angry. I don’t know what she expected given the situation of the restaurant and her subpar service, worsened by her broken English. Her actions upon payment both angered and appalled us.\n\nWe are shocked at the experience we had at this restaurant today. It was not our fault the restaurant was limited in payment options or that we found out after we ordered our food.\nSeeing other reviews with similar experiences it seems to me that this lady is cutting down on this restaurant’s long-lasting fame.

Not going to lie, the food was great, but not the customer service. For starters, we asked for straws as our cups had lipstick stains on them, and she said “no straws.” Which wasn’t a big deal, but that was just the start. We then asked for some boxes for our food, in which they brought a big box to mix everything, but we told them we need separate boxes, because obviously we don’t want to mix our food. She then comes back with the bill, which we couldn’t read, she laughed and said it was in Chinese. We then figured, they were charging for boxes and sauces, and we had to ask for the English version of the receipt, which is when we found that out, so we think she didn’t give us the English version for that purpose. At this point we still didn’t think it was a big deal, as our waitress didn’t speak good English. We finally got the correct receipt, and when we received it, we found that we were charged for soy sauce, and chilli garlic sauce, which is not mentioned anywhere in the menu, nor by the waitress. Then, she charged us for 4 takeout boxes. At this point we were ready to argue, but figured that it was probably their stupid policy, and we won’t be able to change it, so we figured we wouldn’t tip. As we’re signing the receipt, without asking she looks at my sister and tells her you need to tip at least 15 percent, in which my sister replies first of all, I don’t have to tip, that’s my choice, and secondly, you charged us for soy sauces and boxes. She then had a childish outburst in the middle of the restaurant, yelling “WHATT? NO TIP?” Which everyone else in the restaurant saw. Then, she continues yelling out loud that it’s their policy, and we told her she should let us know before charging for something, to which she walked away angrily. We kept the receipt in case she tries to pull something, but beware of the service of this place, specifically the short haired Asian lady who is a server.

All are helpfully labeled on the menu (plus gluten free options) so you know right away if you have one of those diets that you are not a second class citizen.\n\nIf you're looking for a nicer, sit-down dining experience while visiting Capilano Suspension Bridge, you won't go wrong here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMGA9kGEnliRhE1n3SMbGpMRNQDBSnVFc6n2pmA\u0026fid=0x0:0xc8b36ac822f1632a""],""When"":""2024-7-10""}]",

was on the hunt for a different Vietnamese restaurant after having an unpleasant experience at a different restaurant, so my friend and I decided to order takeout from here, what a great find!\n\nAgain, we ordered takeout, so I can only speak to that aspect at this time, and not the atmosphere, service or dine-in experience. Food presentation was great, all items were separated (e.g. noodles for soup, veggies and garnish were all in separate containers, so they didn’t keep cooking or get mushy en route home). We shared Chicken and Chicken Ball Soup and added veggies, Grilled Chicken with Vermicelli and Spring Rolls, as well as Shrimp Salad Rolls. Salad rolls come with two, but were cut into four, which made sharing easy. Shrimp was fresh, had nice flavor, lettuce was clean and crisp. The peanut sauce had a very mild peanut flavor compared to others, it’s good, but I wish it had a touch more flavor. The grilled chicken with vermicelli was exactly what I’d hoped for from this dish since it’s a favorite; it was refreshing to the palate, had fresh ingredients, wasn’t greasy, and the house made fish sauce elevated it. I’d recommend getting the combo that comes with a Prawn Skewer, it’s similar in price, but takes the meal up a notch. Spring rolls were good; however, I wish they were veggie instead of pork, but that’s a personal preference. Had I realized they were pork, I could’ve asked if they’d swap for veggie. They give generous soup portions, making it another shareable dish. The broth had nice flavor, while not being overly salty, and there was generous amount of chicken.\n\nFor the price we paid and the quality, quantity and presentation of the food we received, we were very pleased.

The customer service and the branch owner, Eddie, swiftly reached out to me to address my concerns and got me a complimentary bowl in response to it. The team welcomed me and handled the order superbly this time. Big props to Eddie and the team for the excellent customer service.

There was this one lady that was so sweet, attentive, and caring. It felt like I was eating at a family member's house! My boyfriend and I shared the guacamole and chips and we each had our own burrito. We were a little confused at first because we saw salsa on the menu for other items but they refused to serve it to us with the chips when we asked. So, my boyfriend just ate the chips plain because he doesn't like avocado, and cilantro in the pico de Gallo makes it taste like soap for him. That being said, the chips were both of our favourite parts of the meal. My cauliflower burrito was a little one note, even with the sauce, and could use some lime or freshness. Maybe I'll opt for the tacos next time. Also, some of their cups for tap water are a little dirty. In addition, the tap water isn't clear and looks almost milky. Because of this, I had to buy a bottle of water. If you like water like me I would recommend bringing your own if you don't want to pay and are trying to limit your plastic use.

We decided to try out the North Vancouver location of Jam Cafe.\n\nFrom what I know, other branches of this restaurant tend to be super busy with lineups out the door. Not the case with this one. We walked in and got a table very easily! (Weekends might be a different story) It's a very spacious restaurant with a fun vibe to it; while there was no lineup to get into the restaurant, it was still quite busy inside.\n\nFeatured here:\nLavender Latte\nMocha\nThe Fat Elvis Waffle\nBlueberry Hill Pancakes\nThe Gravy Coops\n\nThe Fat Elvis Waffle is supposed to have peanut butter drizzled on top but our daughter isn't a fan of peanut butter. Instead, the restaurant drizzled condensed milk on top. This was at my request as I had searched the menu to see what other ingredients might possibly be used as a substitute for peanut butter. I was very happy that they were able to grant my request.\n\nMy jaw dropped when the Blueberry Hill Pancakes arrived. Blueberry Hill? More like Blueberry Mountain! It was a ginormous stack of pancakes!  I managed to get through half the stack. The leftovers lasted us two more breakfasts before they were gone! If you like Blueberry Pancakes I highly recommend the Blueberry Hill Pancakes. These pancakes were not only huge, but they were covered with a very generous portion of blueberries \u0026 blueberry sauce. There's a bit of lemon curd on it too, but not quite as much of it as the blueberries. I wouldn't have minded a bit more lemon curd; however, the sparse amount of lemon curd still worked fine for me as it's the blueberries I was more interested in.\n\nVery impressed with this place.

wife and I were hungry and wanted to find a place that served dinner. Of the two restaurants open - Brown's and Jack Lonsdale's, we chose Jack Lonsdale because we had great dining experiences in the past.\n\nWe got in to an empty restaurant, most patrons were seated at the bar counter. There were 2 servers who had a disinterested look, and asked us to sit \""wherever\"".\n\nAfter which they disappeared - one chose to have a very friendly chat with a patron and the other was nowhere to be found. Finally, my wife went to the side station and got our menus.\n\nAgain, no attention - not even water or a drink order.\n\nEventually, we had to wave our menus to attract one of the servers - a Persian lady with blonde curly hair. We expressed our disappointment with having to wait and getting our own menus. Didn't bother her in the least bit.\n\nHalfway through taking our order - she said she had to check if the kitchen had closed! Apparently we were their last order - she \""brought them back\"". On their website - restaurant closes at 11:00 pm!\n\n10:29 Food arrives - the Nachos were burnt on the edges, the Beef dip sandwich - bread was COLD, beef had zero seasoning, and my wife's French Onion soup tasted like hot water!! Again, drops food off and disappeared.\n\nWe downed the food - thankfully I had asked for gravy, left the soup and again, did the wave to get our check. She asked \""how was everything\"" and I calmly shared our experience and asked for my check.\n\nShe insisted on calling her manager, Mike, and I let him know just how terrible our experience was. He offered us a discount but I refused and paid full amount - no tip.\n\nHaving spent decades in the food service industry, I'm well aware of things going wrong, but that's why staff do quality checks!\n\nIt's hard for restaurants to keep up with competition and food delivery options, which one would expect establishments like this would work hard to deliver good service and food.\n\nPost COVID, as restaurants opened, we came to this restaurants and generously tipped - knowing how hard it had been on operators and staff. They had a 2 for one brunch but I insisted on paying for both - just our way of supporting local business and staff.\n\nDisinterested staff + appallingly bad food = poor management.\n\nWell now they are on our NEVER AGAIN list."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN61jkZfquyEayxt8UbVeB1KHNyK-E8svRLuqes\u0026fid=0x0:0xcede810f598babcb""],""When"":""2024-11-11""},{""Name"":""Pam Delfino"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVou97WNj_X-lZ_I6WAUZr7ELzzqVVEd-LYy7ydp9dEDslErRA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Large selection of craft beer!
