I also love the overall vibe—sipping tea, relaxing, and chatting without feeling rushed.\nMy first visit was on a rainy Vancouver day, but as soon as I stepped inside, it felt like a burst of sunshine! This cafe gives me such a peaceful, happy feeling, like a little escape from the hustle and bustle outside. Now, I visit all the time and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ks"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWY_qIX-Alu7CtPDFDUtTkSlRT1hVzcFbm9j9HEOogCz6HKZgzElw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""I recently tried the oolong tea latte at Tealips Cafe and was disappointed with the flavor profile. The drink was incredibly light, almost like drinking diluted milk with a hint of tea. It was so subtle that it was difficult to detect any distinct oolong flavor.\n\nWhile it's possible that the oolong tea used in this latte is simply not a good match for milk, I've never encountered this issue with other oolong tea lattes. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that this particular combination just didn't work.\n\nUnfortunately, based on this experience, I won't be ordering the oolong tea latte again at Tealips Cafe.

The outside is like a dry Japanese-style cheesecake, and the inside is a regular chocolate cake, but the combo together is quite interesting.\nI'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy coffee and need my daily dose, so I did find their coffee overall a bit acidic for my tastes. To each their own.\n\nThere's a small Specialty Menu on the side that I didn't realize until after I paid, I  would want to dry the Espresso Tonic or Orange Espresso. They also sell beans by the cashier. You pay at the cashier, and there's no screen to tip which I appreciate. I personally rather pay for a more expensive cup of coffee than tip, as I usually only sit for 15-30min, and take my own cup/plates away before leaving.\n\nSmall cafe, about 4 small seats and a few by the bar so it does fill up fast. There's a large parking lot for the plaza, but it's paid parking only. Prices are pretty standard for a small local coffee shop.

I ordered a cup of espresso, which was very aromatic and rich. My favorite thing about this company is that every branch provides oat milk or soy milk for you to add to your coffee at the counter.

The food and service at this location were consistent with the standards we've experienced at other ZUBU spots.  However, we were slightly disappointed with the ramen noodles — they were soft and overcooked. This was unexpected since ZUBU typically delivers on quality.  We also noticed a steady stream of takeout orders, which may have impacted the kitchen's focus.\n\nOn a brighter note, we redeemed our ZUBU rewards points for their 5-piece Crispy Chicken and Pan-Fried Pork Gyoza, both of which were delicious!  If you're a fan of ZUBU, downloading their app is a must — it’s an easy way to earn rewards and enjoy perks during every visit.\n\nOverall, ZUBU Metrotown is a decent option for a casual bite during a shopping trip, but we hope they can improve consistency, especially with their ramen.\n\n📝📝\n\nFood: 🍜🍜🍜 Can Try!\nService: 👩‍🍳👩‍🍳👩‍🍳👩‍🍳\nKids: 👶👶👶👶 Yay!

Individual portions are even smaller than a mini and the cumulative size of all three is probably similar to that of a mini ( by weight/volume) which doesn't seem to be worth the price as I could get a regular sized ramen for cheaper. See picture of empty bowls for size comparison between mini and those in the flight ( keep in mind that the it's typically filled to slightly below the zubu word on the bowl and that is the narrowest parts of the bowl which creates an optical illusion that it's alot larger than it actually is). Most But good option for those that just can't choose.\n\nTaste wise:\nTonkotsu soup was a let down. Not much bone broth flavour. Noodles were good. Not much toppings.

It was quite relaxing while we were there.\n\nI dont know who the owners are exactly, but I had a rather different experience with the service.

I chose the butter paneer wrap, a slice of strawberry NY cheesecake, and a strawberry matcha bubble tea. The wrap was huge! The filling was very flavourful, spicy but not extremely \""hot\"". The cheesecake was very dense, which is definitely the right way to do a NY cheesecake but after the paneer wrap it was almost too much for me... that's my own fault for not thinking through what I was ordering. I really liked the strawberry topping, which tasted like homemade strawberry jam with big strawberry slices. The strawberry matcha also was great, it had a nice layer of sweet and vibrant strawberry compote on the bottom, which combined nicely with the unsweetened matcha for a balanced taste. $22 total, which was a good price for a hefty serving of quality food.\nIf I come back, which I'm very tempted to, I will have to try one of their housemade cookies."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN6twCj7ekvrl2jXMCKnEtyTwgvnHTGzTjzpGlX\u0026fid=0x0:0x6c89ce2572269409""],""When"":""2024-5-26""},{""Name"":""Stella Oh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvqyQ2KS_YIN6XYOMkDtQZO2ezjEJLWRODsOzNFIWuIhCYtAL-=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My husband and I stopped by out of curiosity.

The oysters are fresh and plentiful, adding a pleasant brininess to the dish. 8/10\n\n**Omelet**\nThe omelet is decent, featuring a generous amount of mushrooms. However, it could benefit from a bit more seasoning to enhance the overall flavor. 7/10\n\n**Satay Skewer**\nI was very disappointed with the satay skewer. The lamb pieces were too large and tough, and the lack of seasoning made the dish quite bland. 2/10\n\n**Lamb**\nThe lamb is juicy and flavorful, though the portion size is somewhat thin. It’s well-seasoned, which makes it enjoyable, but the accompanying vegetables were bland and lacked seasoning. 7/10\n\n**Service**\nThe service is poor and inattentive staff, which detracts from the dining experience.\n\n**Ambience**\nThe restaurant is located inside a mall, which gives it a casual vibe.

There are many other dishes I’m curious to try, and hopefully, the overall experience will be better next time."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN1uWFVQ8Lva418-2QHdbHfgLTovwv0gVQbdkAf\u0026fid=0x0:0xc1f6ac8a64b53386""],""When"":""2024-6-12""},{""Name"":""chan Cindy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVaeOXV6kT2G98yuvkhh00Ns9a0SyZ7N-CPIvk93SlbI2dHg53blA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I was very disappointed.

Unashamedly ordered same.\nThe place was not crowded and the service was relaxed but staff were very friendly and responsive. Food was what I expected and remembered.\nFacility was accessible and washrooms looked well maintained and clean albeit felt a bit dark. Though it seems to fit with the overall design of the restaurant.\nThe booth was reasonably comfortable but recall them to be a tad more roomy. This maybe more related to my increasing girth over the years than the furnitures themselves. Appreciated the thoughtful details with the hooks to hang a jacket or walking canes for example.\nThe staff let us linger awhile and just chat and reconnect.

And when she went to ask the other cashier and the cashier said we can only do either discount or redeem the points. They looked like they had no idea how to solve this issue. It took them more than 7 minutes to say we can either do discount or redeem points. Being a regular starbucks customer this was one of the most bad customer service.

He went to the manager and tried to help me out. 2mins later he came back and he asked me to show the order details. However my order was complicatedly customized, I felt extremely sorry for making issues for them.\nHe wrote down the order on a paper bag and give it manager.\n5mins later he hand the two cups of drink to me with smile and gentle attitude.\nI leave some tips and walked out of the door.\nDuring the whole visit, I was served by a wonderful team with perfect customer service.

Only 2 tables open for dine-in, but feel free to order take-out or delivery.\n\nMy order:\n\n-Japanese Style Cheesesteak: my personal favourite - juicy sautéed mushrooms \u0026 onions, aged cheddar, wasabi mayo and of course premium ribeye steak slices. It’s saucy, and the cheese blend enhances the flavour.\n-Koagie (Korean Hoagie): Kimchi was good (not too sour or spicy), so I could comfortably eat it.\n-New Yorker: the classic if you don't want to venture away from a\n\""normal Philly cheesesteak\"" - topped with fresh tomatoes and lettuce\n\nOverall, the hoagie roll was soft on the inside, and a good chewy texture on the outside. I reheated mines in the microwave, and it still tasted good several hours later. These cheeseteaks are more saucy than the traditional cheesesteaks, which I personally enjoyed as every bite was filled with flavour. Very filling - best to share if you want to try different flavours. I also really liked their assortment of cheeses (no fake Cheez-Whiz stuff, sorry if you like that though), I think they use aged cheddar, provolone, and some others in a cheese blend. They definitely don't cheap out, and use a generous portion of tender/sliced prime rib steak. All cheesesteaks are made-to-order on a grill when you place your order.\n\n-Onion Rings: skinny-style\n-Deep Fried Pickles: good thick cut of pickles to breading ratio\n-ACC Fries (Garlic Butter \u0026 Parmesan): classic thick cut fries with a very \""potato-y\"" flavour\n-White Chocolate Blueberry Milkshake: quite sweet, definitely for people that have a sweet tooth\n\nAlso, I definitely have to mention the house-made sauces, they're so good for dipping the onion rings, pickles, and fries (cheesesteaks were saucy enough, so I didn't need it there). My personal favourites were the roasted garlic aioli, smoke Chipotle BBQ (not to overpowering or salty), and mustard (real mustard seeds)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPy4x4SxlJVE85YyYd_JGDKxnrGdZkXh6kVcPFk\u0026fid=0x0:0xac3531c6b4a6f4ed""],""When"":""2021-3-11""},{""Name"":""Dimitri Pelosof"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIfM58KLNF27k8gTDOAVxOk2C6YwnGFyNuoc3mVfuH_B24uvA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Big shot was so amazing the staff member truffle aioli sauce is bomb would definitely come back again best cheesesteak I ever had."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPOB1N550TcmKkU4hbjaA_E1bPslT_EyeIYt90u\u0026fid=0x0:0xac3531c6b4a6f4ed""],""When"":""2024-8-3""},{""Name"":""tarneema propa"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXwd9dHiU9egWWKWk0jQDOep6xbwkVQ_SHmBqvP7L114SCcbxlJ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Recently the poutine which I always order from here is  not up to the standard.

The owner reached out on Instagram though, so appreciate them correcting the lapse for next time around!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMBjMvBS50qN9T-bpCuZ4cr-D64q1x4KynmAjBo\u0026fid=0x0:0xac3531c6b4a6f4ed""],""When"":""2021-1-30""}]",

Earls Station Square for my birthday. Laren was our sever for the evening and he was great until an order mix up which put a damper on the rest of our time at Earls.\n\nI ordered the Cajun Blackened Chicken but instead was served a salmon dish. When I informed Laren about the wrong order, I was met with doubt and annoyance. Laren did not offer to correct the mistake right away and it seemed he wanted to persuade me to keep the salmon. At no point did Laren show accountability for his mistake nor did he apologize for it, it almost appeared that he casted blame my way like I misremembered what I ordered. I had deliberated between a burger and the Cajun Blackened Chicken when I reviewed the menu, not once did I even consider the salmon. I honestly felt gaslit by Laren during this whole interaction… I was certain I ordered the chicken…\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to share a proper meal with my family on my birthday. By the time the correct dish was served, my parents were already finished with their food. What was supposed to be a joyous occasion was shadowed by Laren’s poor attitude and the awkward atmosphere that followed the conversation about the mix up. I felt it was obvious he avoided our table the rest of the evening while he was attentive to others around us. We also waited quite a while for our bill, which furthered the frustration.\n\nThe food somewhat compensated for the poor customer service. All of our dishes were delicious and well made. In addition, I was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary brownie at the end of our meal (not the birthday dessert special, which I felt too awkward to ask Laren about).\n\nAlthough the food was very appetizing, it’s really a shame that Laren’s sour attitude and lack of professionalism made our dining experience uncomfortable and subpar."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPl0b02dlIbOIgXLcQPnM_0BPk9NI9LzdhBP2nz\u0026fid=0x0:0x1e8568236be22147""],""When"":""2024-12-17""},{""Name"":""Thais Oliveira"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKXD1ghyGnpuIJs3_L2s_WmL-t8i8bpNdTnvYmAiDTd_aiIWg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This was the best dining experience I’ve ever had.

Do not lie to my face and say you clean the floors everyday. You can’t lie and say that this amount is accumulated in one single day.\n\nBest course of action is to make sure floors are done both before opening AND after closing…\nPlease clean the floors… seriously.\n\nThis is a food service business not to mention a business franchise. Fraser Health have already been notified about this.\n\n——————\nUpdate 10/16:\nAddressing the response received from BLENZ management - it is understandable that being in a mall with a pest issue is inevitable but the responses from that one employee (female, young Asian with glasses) is extremely offsetting and off brand. Overnight accumulation of rodent droppings is something you cannot prevent, I won’t deny that! However if this was something you have already been aware of and not actively trying to do more cleaning makes it very unappealing to consumers who drop in to purchase FOOD and DRINKS. These aren’t products that you can “clean” and “sanitize” after purchase before use.. these are products purchased to be consumed before they go bad.\n\nAgain, I know what a single night of rodent droppings accumulation looks like, it is definitely not what I saw and photographed. If cleaning was maintained twice a day, daily.. there wouldn’t be 1 speck visible during operating hours. This tells me and shows me that your staff is not fully and diligently cleaning in the evening as well as not thoughtfully going along the floorboards (if you know rodent activity, which clearly you do not…they tend to scale the walls and leave feces/urine along that trail).\n\nFor someone that has dealt with rodent issues both at work and at home for the last decade, please do not brush me off as if I do not know what I am talking about.\n\nFood service businesses need to be extremely diligent and not slacking in any aspects.. this can lead to so much with food borne illnesses etc. oh and yes, Fraser Health was indeed notified and will be having follow ups with them hopefully soon!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPU7rgPN2OuE1dwe_JaIhuzvnlxi8uY2ZBeO8vX\u0026fid=0x0:0xedceefa29ec83173""],""When"":""2024-10-15""},{""Name"":""Mich"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUk4SJkfT35Lr0ZUsPgvMr5zk32J8m9TBN0sQWcp7LTonWmgO0=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""Prices have definitely skyrocketed, sadly.

I work in customer service and feel for employees, therefore I politely told them that I ordered the iced latte and patiently waited. This other blond girl that was working, quickly made the right order and handed it to us. Though, I’m not exactly sure what happened but I think the blond girl might’ve scolded the new employee because after we told her it was the wrong order, they conversed and the new employee started crying.\n\nMy mother’s macchiato was good. My drink on the other hand was not pleasant at all. At first I thought it was just because it was unsweetened so I asked for a sugar packet and I mixed it in. It was still horrible. It was extremely grainy and I’ve had matcha numerous times before and it was never like this. I even poured the matcha in the sink and there was an insane amount of leftover powder. Matcha, if made right, is not supposed to be grainy at all.\n\nAfter tasting the matcha the second time I went back. I did not think to go back, I was willing to let it be, but my mother insisted because after all, we did spend our money on it. I politely let the blond girl know that the matcha was extremely grainy and that I could not continue to drink it as it was bothering my throat. I even apologized for coming back because I didn’t want to make their day any harder, and it would’ve been fine had the blond girl not been passive aggressive and rude about it. She claimed that that was the “right way to make matcha” (it’s not) and said that she won’t do anything about the order because she did nothing wrong she only “made it the right way”. I did not expect to get a refund or even a remake but simple accountability and apology would’ve sufficed.\n\nKeep in mind, I was making sure that I was not being rude, even with my tone or my wording. Her reaction was completely unprofessional and disrespectful. That was horrible customer service."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""J.

Every time I eat \""Hula Poke\"", I feel healthy, and my stomach feels comfortable. I can say it's definitely the best healthy option in the Foodcourt of Metrotown. I especially recommend their Tiki, Yuzu, and Koko (spicy Korea). \""Tiki\"" is a truly special and amazing taste that I've experienced for the first time. \""Yuzu\"" tastes like soy sauce based and is a bit salty, but you can ask for less sauce if you don't like salty taste. All \""poke bowls\"" are always fresh and of good quality, unlike the cheap ingredients. The Metrotown branch (located near the entrance to the food court) is very friendly and clean and provides generous amounts of protein. So I always come here on purpose, and if I can't come, I order a poke bowl through \""DoorDash\"". I am always very satisfied and recommend you to visit too.\n\nOh, I almost forgot to recommend their delicious \""lava\"" coffee, so I'm adding it now. The latte is made with 100% plant-based coconut milk and is dairy-free, making it super healthy. I want to drink this lava coffee every day. The taste is so great and they make it one by one when you order. Definitely the best, you should try it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMb2Z7hwy9MUae1Xs9KXJfkiUGSb2b9UTDSA7ax\u0026fid=0x0:0x7e7c7e258692f75b""],""When"":""2024-2-11""}]",

The entire neighbourhood is a huge development in Burnaby.  It’s a very popular place to live and work.  There are tons of stores nearby so you can shop till you drop.  Then come to Starbucks for some R\u0026R.  The location is perfect for access or a meetup, because it’s literally right beside the Skytrain.  You can’t miss it.  It usually has a water fountain out front which adds to the experience, but sadly it wasn’t working on the day I visited.\n\nThis Starbucks sits on top of a McDonalds, and both places have large windows to sit beside and watch the world go by.  Starbucks has a unique wrap around corridor with ample seating so that you can get a good view, no matter where you sit.  Lots of light to say the least.  Perfect for the long Vancouver winters where light is the most valuable commodity.  Even the McDonalds below the Starbucks appears to have a very interesting open concept design.\n\nI was working on a tower nearby so I had to be at work early, and thankfully the Starbucks was open.  Their hours are amazing.  5:30AM-10:30PM on most days.  Great for construction workers or anyone with unusual  work hours.  Shooting the Starbucks at night was almost more interesting than the daytime because the light is so dramatic.  I also came to Starbucks during the day for coffee, and also took more pictures.  My day ended at 8:30PM so I was able to snap a few more night pictures at Starbucks, grab some of their delicious Avocado spread which I'm kind of addicted too, before hopping on the train.\n\nAs usual, wifi, food, ambiance, and coffee was great.  I know what I’m getting at Starbucks and I love that predictability.  Also, the staff were excellent.  Very friendly and helpful.  I was so surprised to see the option to tip the staff with a card.  Usually most Starbucks require a manual cash tip.  The nice barista said that this new tipping method “may” be rolled out to all Starbucks.  That would be great, as cash isn’t the most convenient thing to carry around.\n\nAll around great coffee shop in a very attractive mall that sits in a very attractive part of Burnaby.  Brentwood is popular and appears to be thriving.  Lots of towers going up around here, for good reason."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPXrPk4nn0x2hbUaNye5kS4vjhFfnblTAolt3uZ\u0026fid=0x0:0xd0051032d291910b""],""When"":""2023-4-6""},{""Name"":""Edgar Ignacio"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV7oexz4qXoBKr6ujKuYxwMvlf16ckv-ovFMKFmC4nzUqeMSoelFA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Very good location along Brentwood district with ample amount of seating inside the shop.

Their 100% sugar is not sweet at all and the drink tastes good even if it’s not mango season. I also tried the grape one a couple times and I think that’s what they’re known for and it’s also super delicious, even if I’m not a big fan of grape flavoured things :)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNL9oYymSLFwydHtz60X_MvF4BxuW5eg4cdMt8O\u0026fid=0x0:0xb8907638c7c4754e""],""When"":""2024-11-13""},{""Name"":""Hornson C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVmdCOdf2WkxshuYZj4HJ9-vQ7jEjZprqyHTmAPfOUXSG3SYvc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""《🧋 REAL MILK, REAL FRUIT, REAL TEA 🧋》\n\n- mango grapefruit sago = $8.99 -\n- brown sugar bobo oat milk = $9.99 -\n\nIt's been over 12 years since Hey Tea served up their first ever cup of cheese tea in Guangdong Province. Now they've brought their top quality drinks to Crystal Mall in Burnaby for you to enjoy!\n\nThey boast using only real ingredients in their tea creations, and you can taste the quality with each sip. Of the two drinks I tried, the mango grapefruit sago was definitely the stand out choice. My fiance noted that every ingredient in that drink was cut up to the perfect size so that nothing would get stuck in the straw. Seems basic, but it's a detail that a lot of other stores fail to pay attention to.\n\nThe brown sugar in the second drink was strong but not overpowering. I really liked the taste of the roasted cane sugar and soft, but chewy tapioca pearls. I know Hey Tea is known for their real milk, but I am very appreciative for their non-dairy options for lactose-intolerant people like myself 🥹\n\nDon't wait!

My hunger was ferocious, and the enticing aromas of sizzling teriyaki lured me into the siren’s trap that is Koya Japan. Little did I know I was about to embark on a culinary nightmare so profound, Gordon Ramsay himself would weep.\n\nThe line moved slower than a glacier, as though each customer before me was hand-forging their teriyaki dreams from scratch. At last, it was my turn. I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki Bento—a safe, classic choice, or so I thought. The price? A staggering $14.95. For that price, I expected a taste of Mount Fuji itself.\n\nThe first red flag? The chicken looked like it had fought valiantly in a grease war and lost. It was drowned—no, submerged—in teriyaki sauce so syrupy and overwhelming it could have doubled as engine oil. The vegetables were limp, lifeless, and tasted like they’d been resurrected from last week’s compost pile. And the rice? A soggy blob that clung to my fork as though it feared the outside world.\n\nAh, but let’s talk about the “tempura,” if we dare call it that. The batter was a soggy, oil-soaked crime against all things crunchy. Each bite felt like chewing on a damp napkin. The shrimp? A whisper of protein lost in a sea of grease. I could feel my arteries pleading for mercy.\n\nAs I sat there in the crowded food court, staring at my meal like a tragic Shakespearean hero surveying the ruins of his life, I noticed something curious: the staff, moving with the urgency of sloths on a coffee break, were haphazardly slapping together orders. Quality control? Nonexistent. Passion? A distant memory.\n\nI left Koya Japan not just disappointed but personally offended. Offended that this establishment dares to peddle such lackluster meals in one of Canada’s busiest malls. Offended that I spent $14.95 to feel betrayed. My stomach churned with regret, and my soul yearned for the innocence I had lost.\n\nTo the brave souls considering Koya Japan: turn back now. Go anywhere else. Heck, eat at home. The culinary gods will thank you, and your wallet will too.\n\nOne star—and that’s only because zero stars isn’t an option."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOcFXLI0fHSydf5iCK8407MQGzii8eGDtxqjqTe\u0026fid=0x0:0x47770b74a4caa896""],""When"":""2024-12-14""},{""Name"":""Michael Kashkov"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUHQqdkZ8UrMNX3JXJAPLi5tzL0seRzCv7BAbjOzZvIyrXvPY1SuA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I cannot believe that I still can get a decent portion of ramen for approx $12 and not be hungry afterwards.

It’s rare to find a restaurant or café with such high standards, and I’m so grateful to have discovered this gem after hours of research (for ube 😂) during our trip to Vancouver! As an ube fanatic, this place was absolutely perfect. Here’s the breakdown:\n1.\tWaffle: Perfectly crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, with distinct ube flavors throughout. Highly recommend pairing with ube ice cream—but don’t place it directly on top to preserve the waffle’s crispness.\n2.\tChicken: Golden-brown and perfectly crispy with the right temperature and thickness. Slightly salty for me, but sparkling water balanced it out beautifully.\n3.\tSalad: The dressing was too heavy for my mild palate, so I’d separate it next time.\n4.\tFries: A few at the top had the ideal crispness and temperature. Slightly salty for my taste, but overall not bad. (Note: I’m not a big fan of steak fries, so take this with a grain of salt—pun intended!)\n5.\tUbe Latte: Stunning presentation, but tasted more like milk to me. I added no sugar, so that could be why. It paired perfectly with the waffle and ice cream, though, as I found the ice cream slightly sweet for my liking.\n6.\tUbe Bun: Loved the cream filling! A touch sweet for me, but balanced nicely with the ube latte.\n7.\tService: Absolutely amazing—friendly and attentive!\n\nIf you’re an ube lover, this is a must-visit spot!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPiEz_v4YmHxJETzQ5wqBlhz4X0tU1VKFhZtSuJ\u0026fid=0x0:0xf7e0479c8fd0cac9""],""When"":""2024-12-25""},{""Name"":""Ryan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWCDMUY42ah4aAgta84ssT2DYa3PFsR3r4fbxhBdcs3AXShIgTOYw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Casual cafe located just off a busy intersection of Kingsway and Boundary.

cozy vibe and serves delicious food with a unique twist.

The bread was crispy, and the melted cheese was just right.\n•\tPasta: The creamy pasta was a total hit. Well-seasoned with lots of parmesan on top, and the garlic bread was spot on.\n•\tSmoothie: Refreshing and smooth, the perfect addition to the meal.\n•\tRicotta cake: A must-try! It’s creamy, with a mild flavor, making it a great way to end the meal without feeling too heavy.\n\nThe place is nicely decorated with neon lights and a modern vibe, making it super comfortable. They also have a station with utensils, water, and other essentials, which adds to the convenience.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Linda—make sure to ask for her! She has excellent customer service and really enhances the experience. I’ll definitely be back.

Even the garlic bread was sweet, which didn’t pair well with the dish. The dish needs more savory flavours, personally. For the price, it was okay, but I expected more.\n\nService-wise, while the staff were polite, no one checked on us to see if everything was okay.

Croissant, Earl Grey Scone, and a Mocha Cube Loaf. For drinks we ordered a Spanish Latte.\nWe are really impressed by the quality of both the food and drinks here. Starting with the Cookie Croissant, slightly difficult to eat since the cookie part was quite crumbly, but the filling was generous and the flavour was rich and delicious. The scone was a big surprise to us - it was served a little warm, and the inside was super moist. The earl grey flavour was also very pleasant and strong. The Mocha Cube Loaf was moist - the texture is quite like a banana bread but mocha flavoured, but this probably has the most subtle flavour out of everything we ordered.\nThe Spanish Latte came with a very cute bear latte art. Coffee was strong and rich, and is easily one of the best Spanish Latte we have had.\nWe will definitely revisit this place for the rest of their menu!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPHsy3VXVWPc0EglzzV1sjQYMnCz-1qh9Jff_8D\u0026fid=0x0:0xbefc4217b6347d6""],""When"":""2024-9-30""},{""Name"":""Jack Bi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIZ4Bsv7wnjfj756aRVvVyi5fPfQhBIMCe6kqNdp4pTbIyytg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Discover this little hidden gem that boasts an incredibly friendly staff ready to make your visit unforgettable!

It seemed like they were new, so I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. As for the food, the chocolate chip cookie was mediocre.

I felt like we were in heaven for our breakfast."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO1xfOay1A6YbrZ3wA7zDzYNv2r_K861bg3wde3\u0026fid=0x0:0xd6f82a5318716098""],""When"":""2024-8-20""},{""Name"":""Nikki c"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVTEI07jnFTAEaLsFO0c2_mPPfnmG0XKKHuolSSFqT8Xlgj-nIi=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The sausage was juicy and delicious, though the waffles were soft and not crunch (which i prefer) it tasted more like pancakes.\n\nThe portions are not as big as they look.\n\nThe decorations are cute and overall comfortable dining atmosphere."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOpyvGWGINTnl9f3nub4EaJkHMbyvZ3H8uOJ7hG\u0026fid=0x0:0xd6f82a5318716098""],""When"":""2024-9-3""},{""Name"":""Elle L"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUA6uiZPrLU9bl4EujMU3r0rYnUtrFGP8wi2uc18VoJ8Udh_FGB=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We decided to check out 1003 Brunch and Dessert and ordered the pesto chicken focaccia combo (with a side salad and tater tots), the bacon croissant sandwich, and an Oreo iced latte. Unfortunately, the experience fell short of our expectations.\n\nStarting with the pesto chicken focaccia: the bread itself was disappointing. Focaccia is typically known for its airy, slightly crisp, and flaky texture, but this version was far from it. The bottom bun was soggy, and overall, the sandwich lacked the fresh, well-textured bread that makes focaccia so enjoyable. The chicken itself was even more of a letdown—boiled chicken breast with no seasoning. It felt bland and lifeless, lacking any of the flavors you’d expect from a pesto chicken sandwich. We found ourselves reaching for the ketchup served with the tots, which speaks volumes about how little flavor the sandwich had on its own.\n\nThe salad that came with the combo was unremarkable as well. It consisted mostly of plain greens with no standout flavor or dressing that could complement the other parts of the meal.\n\nService was another area that needed improvement. After our food was brought out, our server didn’t check in with us, and we were left without basic essentials like salt and pepper, which could have helped improve the meal’s flavor. It was surprising that we weren’t offered any, as it seemed obvious we needed some seasoning to bring out the flavors of what we’d ordered.\n\nThe bacon croissant sandwich fared slightly better but still wasn’t impressive. The croissant was decent, though it didn’t have the flaky, buttery texture that a well-made croissant should have. While not as bland as the pesto chicken focaccia, it wasn’t memorable either.\n\nFinally, the Oreo iced latte was another disappointment. We had hoped for a drink with a unique twist, but it turned out to be just a standard iced latte with crushed Oreos on top. It tasted like a quick gimmick rather than a thoughtfully crafted beverage. We would have preferred an option to have it as a hot drink, which could have added a nice contrast to the flavors.\n\nOverall, this visit left us underwhelmed. Between the subpar food quality, lack of flavor, and inattentive service, we don’t see ourselves coming back to 1003 Brunch and Dessert. There’s potential here, but for the price, we expected a much better experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPUH29NlM-CmBLD_LOmlcSeukanEn_fDcv2d-TP\u0026fid=0x0:0xd6f82a5318716098""],""When"":""2024-11-11""},{""Name"":""cat"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUOpJ0p_oeAe5MdNgkzgRlfQlHruhwSqcfe0RoRC2l6Ja8sIdzz=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food was great!

This is probably going to be the last time and maybe it's good for them that they don't have me as their customer. The drinks are okay but there is no customer service at this place, especially this time when they made me walk back with the drinks. The person who made my drinks doesn’t seem to be okay with my feedback based on how he reacted, but I think I’m entitled to give feedback as a customer. The reason I give them 2 stars is because they at least made a new drink and up size for me this time, it’s wed anyway, otherwise I would rate them 1 star. I know that he may think he's very good at his job and probably believes he made the very best drinks, but if he put his ego down and listened to customers, he would understand that the drink tastes different this time. That's all I wanted to say. He wasn’t rude or anything, but his facial expressions and words sounded ironic. He seems upset when his colleague’s asking what’s going on. In the end, I just walked away with the new drinks he made (which actually taste better, saying this with no bias).

With the cookies, we're allowed to mix \u0026 match when purchasing a dozen or half a dozen. Good nutty flavours for the almond and caramel crunch cookies, and the jam shortbread still maintained its moistness! The pistachio roll still tasted great the day after when warmed in the microwave to allow the inner filling to melt.\n\nThe only issue we had was with the pear tart and separating it from the outer wrap/paper. It was stuck and we had difficulty peeling it off, so had to basically scoop and eat the pastry from the attached paper. Will return to try some different pastries and baked goods!

Recently, I have seen an employee named Jackie behave in a very disturbing way towards both colleagues and customers. As a psychologist, I can make some guesses from Jackie's perpetually aggressive uncomfortable gaze and perpetually sweaty face. Anyway... In the morning, while he was interfering with a colleague in an unpolite manner, I said with a smile that this was Jackie's rule, not Starbucks'. He angrily kicked me out of the store. I asked him why he was so rude because I hadn't seen other stores charge extra for the milk added to the coffee. When it started to get uglier, I said, why are you so nervous and making people unhappy? From the way people were looking at me and because I wanted the topic to end, I showed him my phone and asked him if he would fire me once again to dissuade him. It started to look even worse because I was calling the police, let alone being quiet or polite. You wouldn't want to see the gaze of employees and customers. I wrote this with the thought that maybe Starbucks officials could save customers and store employees from Jackie.

I’m a senior in high school graduating this year, but scrolling back, you’ll find I’ve been going here since I still went to elementary school. In all these years, I cannot recall a single bad experience. My friend who lives next door told me her entire life’s story at the table by the window. I’ve stared at the same cabinet full off bubble-tea related gifts for years. I’ve watched as their decor changed slightly, adding plushes and cactuses, and the small changes in their menu. I’ve genuinely saved money through their student deals, and the amount of toppings they offer is top tier. I don’t know where I would be without a small, comforting place nuzzled in my life like Tealips. Coco’s mass produced pearls got nothing on my love like Tealips. I’ve sat at those tables as a child, with a mask on during COVID, and even now as a struggling student. In the grand scheme of all things of life, so much is moving, but not Tealips.

I understand that special occasions like New Year's Day may present operational challenges, but consistency in food quality remains paramount.\n\nRegrettably, I'm inclined to withhold future visits for the time being. It appears that the establishment may be unintentionally compromising its commitment to culinary excellence, leaning towards a model that prioritizes quantity over the renowned quality I've previously enjoyed.\n\nThis feedback is offered constructively, with the hope that James Street Cafe continues to refine its operations and maintains the high culinary standards that have characterized my prior experiences."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOcPxy3ghlGKJJ4mZRniHQCqv7csAvh-fWLOoQh\u0026fid=0x0:0xb3311ab1d2946d99""],""When"":""2024-1-3""},{""Name"":""carly reinbolt"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVERp_D9BYOlNXkOO_bEBcw7v9exKrXOeb3L9lXXum6mmX8fxBPmQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""So welcoming!

Their website lists all their menu items \u0026 current prices. Parking is Free in the Parking Lot outfront although a bit busy because there are quite a few business in the corner complex.

For the Chirashi Don was happy with the presentation, size of the peices of sashimi, \u0026 number of pieces was pretty good for the price. Basically 10 pieces for $14.50, lots of tasty sushi rice below too. I would order again but next time will probably go for the Deluxe Chirashi Don to see the difference.

All my quests were very impressed by the food and many said it was best wedding food they have ever had. The desserts were also delicious.  I also received a lot of compliments on how beautiful the venue is. The staff were very on top of the buffet and making sure food was replaced as soon as getting low and the chef was able to accommodate the few guests I had who had special dietary needs. One of the reasons I chose Riverway was the very transparent pricing as well. I compared several venues before choosing and I especially liked how straightforward the pricing structure is at Riverway and it made it easy to plan my budget. I have zero regrets or complaints and could not have chosen a better place to share my special day.\n\nUpdate:  Two weeks after wedding I am still getting calls and texts about how good the good the food was.

The durian croissant had a great filling 🥐 I'm not sure why it was called moissant because it seemed like a normal croissant. The iced Ube haze latte was amazingly full of ube flavor with the perfect amount of Vietnamese coffee ☕ and best of all it was safe for a dairy sensitive person 👌🏽 The staff gave thoughtful suggestions like to try the coffee jelly dalgona drink too so would definitely try that next time.

decent, clean and spacious. They have outside seating which I appreciate a lot!\n\nFood: Just tried their Jupiter sandwich. I had high hopes but it wasn’t able to deliver. It lacks any and all texture, a mostly haphazard construction of very mushy ingredients. A well soaked beef dip is still more interesting. The taste is not for my liking but it is not bad. There is not enough harmony between flavours, and zero texture is making it even more apparent. I believe having a better roasted beef that has a bite to it would elevate the sandwich at least one star!\n\nCost: It is not a cheap place, and with the lackluster sandwich, it is quite low value.\n\nOverall, this is a nice looking place with nice people working inside.

many times and had pretty much very unpleasant experience every time. But I have never given any bad review as I tried to understand the situation every time. This time it went too far and I couldn't ignore. This acknowledgment is much needed for the staff that was working in the store during my visit. Last time I visited is on 13 November 2024 at about 5:25pm.\n\nI went to pay for gas inside the esso and thought of getting something to eat and drink as well. Tim Horton was the place to go. First of all, there was no one to assist. I guess the employee was in washroom. There was another customer standing in front of me. The guy working at esso called the Tim Horton employee to let her know that there are customers waiting. I heard her saying to the guy \""make sure you don't call me while I am using restroom\"". I suppose she was in restroom and responded this because of that.  Once she came to take order, she repeated the same thing to him. Then the guy working at esso replied that if I see customers standing, of course I'm gonna call and let you know and if you don't like it, you can block me.\n\nNow she proceed to take order for me and my friend who was with me. I have asked for coffee and grilled cheese melt. She said that the grilled cheese panini is still thawed and she can't serve that. Then my friend asked if she is able to microwave it and we are okay with that. Then she question back if you have worked at Tim Hortons and thawing take time. My friend acknowledged that she works at Tim Horton as well and we are okay with if you can microwave it. Then she said actually we have it but it is only for uber eats and online orders. Then my friend requested it's just two grilled cheese melt if she can give it to us. She said sorry she can't.\n\nThen I was like okay, leave it. We are not going to order anything at all. As we specifically wanted the grilled cheese melt. As I was about to go, she said please don't give bad review. Then I ask her why not ?\n\nGive me a reason for it. She replied you can do it if you want. But i was just saying.\n\nI was leaving the store and wasn't thinking at all to give review as I mentioned I have been here many times. Got disappointed numerous times and never ever give any bad review. I also work in food and it's been 9 years I have doing it and I understand customer service very well.\n\nHow she responded back to guy working at esso?\nIf you did have the grilled cheese melt then why we were denied?\nIf it was only for online order then why acknowledge it to customer at all?\nThen integrity to ask not to leave bad review. Wow amazed.\n\nWhoever is in charge to this location, you might need to retrain your employee and it's much needed."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ricardo Arreola"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUpnoji5QwbP2Y-m4nuNzbvrIrl1FghE-nvkvtONtITGVJF_vhm=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Unfortunately I have to go to this Tim Hortons location every day for my coffee.

We returned for brunch and had a wonderful experience. Special mention to our server, Ella, who was very attentive with our food, dietary intolerances, and hot water refills. We had the Angus Beef Hash and Blackened Chicken Wonton Soup. The wonton soup was great, but a tad spicy for my taste buds (in the future, I'd ask for the chili oil on the side). They have large TV screens as well, so it was nice to catch some morning hockey while dining! Looking forward to returning to this location in the future, given the exceptional service.\n\nCame here with a group of 8 for an early dinner. We were sat at a higher table with barstool seats, which were hard to move (as they don't glide on the flooring). Being middle-aged, some in the group needed help from others to be \""pushed\"" closer to the table. The food was good. I had the Crispy Cauliflower and Crispy Yam \u0026 Avocado Roll (which was average for the $11 price). The cauliflower had a nice breading and was flavourful, and felt like a slightly smaller portion (\""social hour\"" portion).\n\nWe had some concerns with the lack of service. We constantly had to flag down our waitress as we wanted to place part of our order before 6 pm to take advantage of the social hour pricing. My glass of water never was refilled during the meal. For a large group, it would have been nice to get checked in on from time-to-time, as a courtesy. Because of our group size, we still had to pay the automatic 18% gratuity, but we didn't think the service warranted that amount. The food itself did come out in a timely manner and was done correctly with some diners' special requests. When asked, our server was able to take a group photo of our table.\n\nAmple parking in the parkade below with a 3-hour limit, which I was told was a non-factor after 6 pm when I called the restaurant ahead of time. Overall, we had an average experience! While the food was decent, the service for our larger group left a bit to be desired (3 stars)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMRMdbceD5gvubL_XIV_xZyV73uBO4uvNPN8nFX\u0026fid=0x0:0x1f96fae1d97e6d13""],""When"":""2024-8-30""},{""Name"":""Chris Yeung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUcT6Z40EZW4C3yt0N7VoX3tM1V1mzzAe7xxRrgBiMmtInx7b7I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went to Brown's Socialhouse Brentwood to celebrate a friend's birthday.

I found that interaction suspicious and to my surprise I was right, the mango chunks were indeed old and not edible at all. I knew the taste was off as soon as I ate it since it was way too mushy so I took a piece out and it was brown meaning the mango chunks had rotten. I contacted chatime customer support the same day of purchase and it says they reply within 10 business days. However, is been over a month since the incident and all I got is dead silence. I have both proof of purchase and pictures of the mango being brown and gone bad but no reply. I had gotten sick from consuming just a few sips fortunately I threw away the drink otherwise I would have probably ended up with a bad case of food poisoning. However, the lack of reply and accountability of Chatime has soured my experience with ever going back there as someone who used to buy it once a week for $10 each time I expected at least something edible and if the employees knew something was up they should of spoken up and asked to change my order.

The food was enjoyable, my friends tried the fried chicken sandwich, while I opted for the prawn and scallop paella. We also shared the Birdie's wings and the crème brûlée cheesecake. The wings were decent in flavor but lacked meatiness. However, the crème brûlée cheesecake was the standout, it was absolutely delicious and worth a return trip just for that!\n\nWhile the food was satisfying overall, the service left much to be desired. Our server was notably slow, taking a long time to take our order and bring the bill. We ended up spending almost two and a half hours there, mostly waiting for our server to check on us. I had to wave them down repeatedly, and it was only when a different staff member noticed that I got any attention. The restaurant wasn’t particularly busy, so I’m not sure why the service was so delayed.\n\nI wanted to actually tip less because of the service, but I just that the lower option of the tips which was 18% and regret because it wasn’t even worth that.

They had good food, prices, and fast service.  And while the staff are doing an amazing job pushing the current place to 150%, the management decisions that brought it to where it is now, were clearly awful.  The food prices have gone up on average of two dollars since last year, while also shrinking the portion size by almost a third.  The quality of product has also fallen sharply.  There are two active lines of food here, one for Tim Hortons express, and the other for the grill, but management has apparently closed one of the two tills, forcing everyone to go through the grill checkout from the beginning of the grill line, even if you just wanted a coffee.  This negates the value of an express line, and was not a problem before the \""upgrade\"".\nNow the head chef lady, who has been working there forever, doing a great job cooking good food, is tethered to the only till, while her colleagues scramble faithfully to keep up.  This is not a fault of the staff, but rather, the management.  Merciless cost cutting is to blame.  If management were to push the cost cutting any further, this establishment would likely become profit negative.   If you give experienced, dedicated staff low quality products to serve, without the proper tools to succeed, and actually expect high quality food that will create customer satisfaction, you are blind on both sides of the coin."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Axel Galay"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJW4X_1eFL5Ne9l9qxkKyX_NP2g2CtUIWPCBopINNILV4oGWw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""The food here is overpriced and pre cooked under a heat lamp.

Although it was pretty busy we were seated within 10min of our arrival which was by the window on the second floor. The Canucks game was playing and there were ample TVs around  to watch the game in the background while socializing . Our waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs however, you can tell that she was running around most of the night due to her having multiple tables with large groups. A couple of missed drink orders but totally understandable. We ordered the following appetizers to start: truffle fries, hot wings, lettuce wraps, fresh guacamole and chips. All were good and as expected. For the mains, we all order the 10oz ribeye steak. Everyone agreed that it was tasty and a good sized portion however I found mine a bit salty and garlicky. I would definitely order it again but would request the creole butter on the side. Hence only the 4 stars. We had lots of drinks that were top notch. Started with a few Russel Honey Lager beers to kick things off. Tried a Backcountry Widowmaker IPA which was pretty good as well. Then tried a couple of different cocktails. The ones I’d recommend are the margarita slush, and purple reign. Finally capped it off with desert which I’d highly recommend not skipping because the cheesecake and Affogato ( a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a shot off espresso) were pretty darn good!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPhf-ST2zJNpIcKBGo9JI_nXupYyAZQ31laQM6X\u0026fid=0x0:0x26d644e7075a79b3""],""When"":""2024-11-24""},{""Name"":""Nathan Chang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjULis9x-C7u8jouJ6bmV-m7Mb2r-esn5uJaOqGwjwAA9z2MADUV=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The food took awhile to come and in the end it was alright.

Upon arrival the host greeting was good but quick, not much talking, no notice about the notes of the anniversary. As someone who works in this industry I was expecting by leaving a note about this special occasion that maybe something more than just regular service would happen sadly it didn’t. Server was nice and friendly, she was on point with her service aside from the dessert, a kid walked to the wrong table with our dessert from afar and then went away, came back 3 minutes later and the ice cream was completely melted all over so we sent it back. When server Ashleigh came by she asked what happened I explained and it was a quick ok and walk away which wasn’t the worst thing in the world just wasn’t the service I was expecting as I thought it was a new restaurant similar to cactus earls etc. key notes I can say. Our server was still very kind and took care of the dessert off the bill, the only main disappointment was no recognition of the special occasion. I wanted to take her originally downtown to five sails but when she suggested we try a new place out I agreed and I put the reservation in hoping the notes would make it a bit more of experience. The food itself was good. The truffle waffle fries were hot and crunchy which we loved with the truffle dip. We had the fish and chips, a bit too battered, barely any fish, prawns are good though. Spicy margarita was good and so was rum and coke.

Beautiful aesthetic, if a little eclectic (jehova's witnesses bookstore and clock collection?). Lots of space and usually isn't too packed.

Their drinks are really nice, but the prices are quite high--a simple latte is like $8, and if you want a non-dairy milk, that'll set you back another $1.5 or so which is quite a bit. Not sure how much of the food they make in house, but most of it is really nice. Very few vegan options, if any.

Also tried an extra order of Unagi hand-roll as well. Very good!\n\n🍣Sashimi platter was 100% SO GOOD-SO FRESH. Very fresh with premium ingredients. I love that they served fresh wasabi because it really enhanced the freshness taste of the sashimi and doesn’t make your nose feel like it just came out of a boxing match! Presentation was on point. Highly recommend getting this platter to pair with the hand rolls if you can eat more or bring +1.\n\n🍣Salmon Oishi — Smoky, tasty \u0026 rich flavours. Definitely recommend!\n\n🍶Cocktail was refreshing. I got lychee berries which was a best-seller. They also have nitrous matcha which I’m excited to try on the next visit! (wanted to order it but was really full at this point.)\n\n🍡Dessert was mochi ice cream. 4 flavours — matcha, vanilla, peach, strawberry. It completed the meal and left me satisfied.\n\nInterior design is modern, unique and definitely a meaning behind the design I’d love to know about it (FYI: each Hello Nori location has a different unique design with the same materials). Overall, was spacious, very clean, good amount of natural light. Loved the music \u0026 vibes here.\n\nPrice point is very reasonable with the quality of ingredients \u0026 services you’re getting from here.

The steak was tough, and the Arctic char was dry with underwhelming crispy skin, and I found a chipped shell in one of my oysters.

Inside, it’s spacious yet inviting, with an interior design that feels both grand and comfortable. The menu is extensive and diverse. Service was spot-on too. Wade took care of us and did a fantastic job, striking just the right balance between attentive and relaxed. The food itself? No complaints, as everything was beautifully balanced, leaving us fully satisfied. However, the experience wasn’t without its hiccups. Perhaps due to the sheer size of the place, the food arrived painfully slow, even the oysters. And they weren’t even at half capacity, from what I could tell. There seemed to be a bit of a bottleneck between the kitchen and the table, and I could actually watch my coffee sit at the bar long enough to go cold, which is a bit disappointing, especially given the impressive coffee setup they have. I’m hoping these are just teething issues as they figure things out because this place has serious potential.

It has been awhile since I last tasted any fast Hong Kong cafe food on Nathan Road in Hong Kong so this as close to me being a poser as it gets.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Iced Hong Kong milk tea. Tasted pretty watery and weak, missing that nice smooth rich taste.\n2. French toast with salted egg yolk. The picture on the menu looked amazingly good; the salted egg yolk oozing out like lava. In reality, it’s a badly pan seared French toast smothered in condensed milk with a dried up layer of salted egg yolk inside. It’s like a dried up 100 year old cow, nothing is oozing out.\n3. Intestine noodle soup. The intestines had that strong gamey smell and the soup was a bit bland.\n4. Brisket and tendon rice noodle soup. The soup was hot, the tendons were tender, most part of the briskets were tender but a few were stringy. Over decent but definitely wasn’t work the price.\n\nOverall, always an adventure to enjoy the lively atmosphere of the food court here especially during peak hours.\nI would say most of the uncles and aunties running the food stalls are pretty nice and friendly.\nUnfortunately, Nathan Road cafe here is nothing like cafes in actual Nathan Road in Hong Kong.

I ordered an iced oat milk Earl Grey bubble tea. The pearls were very soft and chewy, and the tea had a rich and fragrant flavor. Since I had my dog with me, I sat at their only outdoor table. Soon, a very friendly staff member came out and asked if they could give my dog some free ice cream. When she brought out a cute little cup, I saw some things that looked like chocolate chips on top. I thought they were chocolate chips, but she explained that they were carob beans, which are safe for dogs, and mentioned that she also had a dog. My dog gulped it down in just a few bites.

We picked the Chocolate and Matcha Waffles 🧇\n- Drink: Fairy Rose Milk Tea Cold and Vanilla Lavendar Lattee Cold\n- The store was quite open concept and had decent music on.\n\nPros:\n- Won't be a bad place to study, but it has limited seats overall. Probably roughly 10 tables 📖\n- Waffle was really yummy, I personally liked the Matcha since it was nice and fluffy, and if you look at my photo, you can see the waffle texture. 🧇\n- My partner liked the chocolate waffle, which had bits of chocolate pieces.\n- Both waffles weren't sweet, which really made it worth it for us.👌👍\n- The Fairy Rose Milk Tea, I liked it as I could taste the rose flavoring, but my partner didn't like much as it was more milky. If you like milky with rose flavoring, then give it a try ~\n\nImprovements/comments:\n\n- I think investing in menu per table would be better as people can sit and order. The reason for this is that guest can order whole sitting and can add onto their overall order.\nInstead of paying right at the door with the TV menu.\nMy partner and I would have been more inclined to order another batch of waffles if we hadn't paid beforehand.\n- There was only 1 person during this time, and maybe it would be hard to do this, but the likely of someone ordering more is easier than paying everything first, in my opinion.\n- The chairs are okay. If you are wearing shorts, just pick another chair as it can cause lines on your back legs.\n\nOverall, I won't mind going back again and would recommend trying the place out 😊\n\n-J approved."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOK7RCicdjKvXr8PbNDTnjGvhu_HPvG-cR0yOHw\u0026fid=0x0:0x99d5cb2d2a7625d3""],""When"":""2023-6-12""},{""Name"":""Yuen Tso"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLGxQe3CGkaLkRsj4mn2zb12RFye96G7s1qoZk2obkll8HdPJM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""It’s a shame they charge a cup fee on uber eats and door dash when it should have ended on may 1st 2023 hasn’t been fixed still .
