She came back with the drink but no ketchup. By the time we stalled our food start and picked at the food for awhile, finally got ketchup , which was soapy from the wait staff having a soapy towel in the same hand. We love soap finger food or fries and ketchup, mmm.\nThis dining experience reminded us of why we do take out \u0026 have minimal aspirations to eat in at this establishment again.

My 5 year old had the kids size ice cream which was a scoop of ice cream (I think they had 18 flavors to choose from that day) and it was topped with whipped cream, gummy candies and cotton candy (for $3!).

It's early days, but the quality of food and the timely service is commendable.\n\nThe food has a fair bit of variety, low on oil and moderate on spices.

All of them looked like they were in the freezer for a couple months or had been frozen and thawed multiple times (they were also still half frozen). The Spicy Grilled Chicken burger that we ordered also looked like the ppl just threw all the ingredients into the little box, shook it up, and expected it to make itself.\nWas especially mad about the Spicy Habanero McChicken so we called them... A lady picked up the phone and I started off by saying \""hello, we just ordered on skip..\"" and she straight up just ended the call. Called a second time a couple minutes later and they put it through to a fax machine. Called a third time about ten minutes later, and by then they had actually blocked my number.

Then we waited 15 minutes for 2 sandwiches. There was no one else in the store!   Not sure if they have new management or just being cheap.

People don’t like wasting their money and what you are  saying is that we should have ordered 2 sandwiches each instead ? So spend double? A few months ago under the old management a sandwich at your restaurant was just that… a sandwich. It was enjoyable and had adequate filling, not a few stray pieces of meat and a couple of veggies.

Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations.\n\nParking at the Langley location can be a bit of a challenge, but we know the area so that was expected. The restaurant itself is simply furnished, with nothing special to make it stand out.\n\nWe placed a takeout order online, saved 5% (no problems applying the code at checkout), and the order was ready at the indicated time. Service was friendly.\n\nWe ordered pork spring rolls, pork salad rolls, and the following sandwiches: lemongrass chicken, honey garlic chicken and sate beef.\n\nThe spring rolls were delicious! Crispy and not overly greasy.\nThe salad rolls were nothing special. Even the dipping sauce was not very flavourful.\n\nWe ordered all sandwiches with extra pickled veggies, no cilantro.\nThe bread was nice and crusty, but not as special as some of the reviews make it out to be. Unfortunately, the bread to filling ratio was way off.\nFilling was sparse, including the pickled veggies, which we'd ordered extra of (would hate to see what it's like without the extra).\nTo top it off, one sandwich had full cilantro, and another had obviously had the cilantro picked back off, since there were still some leftovers. In this regard the sparse filling was helpful, as I could quickly pick it all off without anyone else seeing (and getting ideas in their head that they could still taste it...). Honey garlic chicken was quite tasty, sate beef was okay with just a tiny little bit of spice, and the lemongrass chicken was rather bland and full of gristle.\n\nPictures are of the honey garlic chicken and sate beef (1/2 sandwich shown; full sandwich size is about 10\"")."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPQiywV8J_89aLLCVDPF9RAbuwR1Ba_5FcjYjTO\u0026fid=0x0:0x8604466a1d06f9d9""],""When"":""2024-6-21""},{""Name"":""Your Dad"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUsCraod052SzzpZMGY6lo4iWb9TrGcmdDrZnPN4UP7KVLJzFAp=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Fresh is the best adjective to describe this restaurant.

They’ve got some fantastic menu items.\nIf you’re craving some pho, rice or whatever you’ll be covered. I tried their combo rice plate which came with grilled pork, lemon grass chicken, meatloaf (ground pork, wood ear mushrooms) and a fried egg on top of rice. This was a large portion and will fill you up if you’re hungry. Also came with a side of broth.\nI also ordered Banh Cuon which is steamed rice rolls with a pork filling. This could be a light meal on its own but we shared amongst three people.\n\nService was friendly and quick. The server helping us kept our water and tea topped up and was always smiling.\n\nI also ordered some take home items. Banh Gio (like a giant dumpling made with rice flour) and Flan for dessert.\n\nRay’s Tips:\nLots of parking in front and back of restaurant.\nCash or Debit accepted for payment."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPbAda1IEylQ_cTJlPjgkvrN_MDa4VJXXCHxuUn\u0026fid=0x0:0xea74b02a243bf2e""],""When"":""2024-8-18""},{""Name"":""Jenn Y"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJqiLL9ZvTs9bElLAJ5ArjOgyozUzBDv3c8c8vRSIbNaw4xv5o=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is the best Vietnamese spot in the Langley area!

Came at dinner time on a Sunday and were sat at our choice of seat (we chose the patio). Order was take quickly and food came out likewise.

Had reservations for dinner as this place filled up quickly.\nWe ordered a few dishes to share, including an appy platter.\nThe food was good and each dish was a nice size portion. The green curry was probably the star dish of the evening as the flavors were on point along with the requested medium spice level.\nThe dishes we ordered were quite expensive for what it was though, for example, the green curry with tofu was $25.50. This definitely isn't a place you'd regularly go to for dinner unless you don't care about saving money.\nThe service was okay, the soup came to our table about 15 minutes after 3 of the 4 dishes arrived at our table and the server checked up on us once to see how everything was, which was before we even got the soup. Then the next time anyone checked up on us, it was when we were done and ready for the bill.\nAll in all, it's a decent Thai food spot and a spot that you should try at least once if you're in the area.\n\n2024/09/23\nCame here on a Sunday evening for dinner, 5 adults and 2 kids.\nThe food was good and the service was relatively the same as the last, all dishes arrived relatively at the same time, except for one dish, which arrived about 10-12 minutes after the majority of the dishes arrived.\nThe good thing is that the dishes have been consistent the two times I have been here and dinner times tend to get busy at this place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPNjcEUqe_4fiiowRtfAy-ggXeFpQ4AOJgFtKVO\u0026fid=0x0:0xf25db44faf68ba17""],""When"":""2024-3-26""},{""Name"":""Ton V"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWb4h6oZDMjakZ7o0kpJmjp_i41AvhfJ62KCrl6wCnDvytBpv4=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""We came with a large group of 9 people so had a chance to order multiple dishes.

The Red Curry Chicken was very nice, the Papaya salad was tasty, and the Pineapple Fried Rice was good too - good portions too. The Fried Snapper was disappointing (more batter than fish). The Spicy Calamari were very small pieces and a bit soggy (probably due to the wet garnish on the plate). The Pad Thai was ok, but a bit surprised the noodles were thinner than we expected.

downtown location for takeout and delivery and always get the half \u0026 half boneless chicken (Yangyeom and Cheese Snow, sometimes Soy Garlic). The portions are great. However, this time the chicken wasn't evenly coated with the Yangyeom and Cheese Snow sauces, and there was so little Cheese Snow powder that it tasted like regular fried chicken.

We also tried the regular fries ($4) which had a good crisp to the outside and tasted great.  We also got a side of yangyeom sauce ($1) to try. There were plenty of fries for the two of us and the yangyeom sauce was sweet and a bit spicy but tasted awesome! We thought that this was a great way of trying each sauce which could in turn be put on a fried chicken order. The restaurant was really clean and staff was very kind.  The lady at the front explained each flavouring and their corresponding spice levels.  She even gave us some of the cheese snow powder on the side to try for free as this is what they put on their shake-shake fries and it was surprisingly good and sweet. We really enjoyed our meal and highly recommend this restaurant to others.

You can order food from the pub menu or the restaurant located directly next door. Some things to be aware of. It can get busy when they’re are tournaments in George Preston arena. Quite often you’ll have individual customers sitting at a table designed for six customers so not great if you’re showing up with a larger group for dinner. Some of the seating has to conform to the layout so some areas you feel like your sitting in the hallway or a revamped recreation centre. There are no exterior windows…not a big deal in the winter but in the summer it has the bunker affect. The food is well pub like the restaurant food on the other is acceptable but a bit pricey for the quality. Would I order the overtop expensive Tomahawk steak? Probably not, it feels risky for the cost/value. I have ordered $45-$50 steaks? Yes and honestly they were okay but just okay a little disappointing if your spouse can make a better steak at home for considerably less. Yes, I have eaten at the Lodge and this a review of the Horse and Ryder but when you can order from the same menus regardless of which location you dine in it’s hard not to merge reviews. By the way my favourite pub menu item is the fish and chips. If you live in Brookswood and you don’t want to drive to WG to The Keg for steak it’s worth checking this place out just ask questions and be fussy if you order a steak and it’s not acceptable for what you paid for. If your looking to have wings and beer and possibly watch the real “Men With Brooms” it’s not a bad local spot."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPaXqMxkRARFPuIZokaC0SxPD1ZlFU4uuWuqtqI\u0026fid=0x0:0xb245bfb988363a45""],""When"":""2023-6-18""},{""Name"":""Sandy Vorberg"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXRUnDlnJ9QoM0O9p2qDa5khVLT8gY3YyZXkZ6lUfwaAS-FLXY=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Second time here at the “new” location at George Preston.

She was very friendly. And polite and got the order correct. However the food quality wasn't good at all. The hummus was as runny as tap water. She put in the smallest amount of rice I've ever seen and barely any chicken on top. The salad wasn't even to the top of the indent in the container.  And to be honest the container looked much smaller than it used to look. Before the hummus was thick and you hot lots of it. They could barely close the lid you would get so much food. Now only a few bites and the food was gone and had to make more food a couple of hours later at home. Not a good deal for $15. When restaurants lower the quality and quantity of their food. They will lose business. They have lost mine now. I would let the owner know if they are reading this, it's better to serve a good portion at a good price then to be stingy and lose a customer.

While the gesture was appreciated, it didn't feel like a fair resolution considering the overall disappointment with our meal.\n\nOverall, The Lodge Steakhouse did not live up to its reputation.

It was about an hour before they closed, so they weren’t slammed but I have order other times and have always received food promptly. I ordered the tempura prawns, with a Philadelphia roll, negitoro roll and a half order of sockeye salmon and it hit the spot! It wasn’t super cheap, $50 for everything with a %10 tip, but this is pretty standard for the items I ordered. I had a bit of the rolls leftover and ate them the next day and they were still tasty with just a bit more solid rice which is to be expected.

So glad to see more Korean food alternative on this side of the town.\nBossam - originally I was worried that it might be tasteless and dry based on the look. But it’s actually flavourful and soft. Wrap with cabbage and spicy radish salad. So meaty yet refreshing. U can ask for bean sauce on the side to add extra layer of taste.\nWoorinara soup - basically a spicy beef soup. It’s very rich of beef and kimchi flavours. It’s quite spicy though so be aware if u can’t handle the spiciness. Too spicy for me but I really enjoyed it.\nSpicy cold noodle - it’s good and refreshing, add some mustard and vinegar to make the taste more vibrant.\n\nOverall i really enjoyed my meal there.

It was breaded with an extremely crispy batter that had the texture of a dried duck (that I give to my dog). Admittedly this might be a different dish or specialty that we simply don't like, so to each their own. But we wanted Korean Fried Chicken and this was not at all the double breaded and fried KFC we are used to at all the other Korean Chicken restaurants.\n\nSo sad.

Chef Jason provided an amuse bouche that I wish I could remember the details of but I wanted to order MORE of that delectable morsel of flavour explosion. My friends went to a different chain restaurant on the same evening and I felt bad to decline, but after dining this good I doubt if I could be tempted to ever set foot in one again. If you want a great ambiance and dining experience, I highly recommend ATLAS. Why are you still reading this? Go make reservations already! Thanks to everyone else on staff that contributed to our evening that I did not get to personally interact with. The bar got set a few notches higher tonight. Much appreciated"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMlLMT4sbm9NP2l18vwwYyErqEnD3Gjn0Dt4sG1\u0026fid=0x0:0xc08ace3e4357f3f5""],""When"":""2024-7-22""},{""Name"":""Al So"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLumQHIv-5W9wXPr4ZbA1zWCVnPk2w1Kc3bjsO93-VMG-v7JQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Atlas Fish in Langley is full of surprises, starting with its convenient location connected to a casino.

Each dish was fresh, flavorful, and had us wanting more. For the main course, I went for the surf and turf with steak 🥩 and lobster 🦞. It did not disappoint.

The teriyaki sauce tasted really good as well, it’s not overly sour and not too salty. For me, this by far is the best Salmon Teriyaki I have ever had.

Very frustrating!). So I called the restaurant directly to ask which, if any items are vegan friendly. She started rattling off chicken dishes! Huh?? I told her chicken is an animal and NOT vegan. She then said butter chicken, and again started rattling off more chicken dishes... again, I told her, neither CHICKEN or BUTTER are vegan. So incredibly unhelpful/uneducated, that I didn't trust even ordering! They lost a first time, and potentially ongoing customer, as I really do love Indian food. Please educate your staff on what the different food preferences \u0026 allergens are (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.), and the dishes that correlate accordingly.

to Sammy J for the first time.  The experience was less than desirable.  Lady was nice when ordering or drinks.  Took over 20 minutes to get our drinks.  Ordered the chicken strips for my son and steak frites for me and my wife.  Waited another 30 minutes for our food, which is normal with the restaurant pretty busy. Drinks were empty and had to wait another 20 minutes to her news drinks.  The chicken strips were so dry and burnt. The veggies coming with it were dry and old.  The steaks were over cooked, dry and full of nerves.  It was like eating a leather belt.  Fries were good. But it's an expensive meal when an establishment don't care what's coming out of their kitchen.

There are parkings available  in the plaza parking lot. Inside is a bar section to the left and a dining section with  booth seats and tables to the right.\n\nHere were the food I ordered after scanning through the menu;\n\n1. Original Caesar drink. It was okay, needed to be drunk before I say it’s good.\n2. Cream of tomato soup. It was hot, rich and creamy. It’s one of those you either like it or hate it, but I personally find it a bit too paste like almost like pasta sauce.\n3. Wings and drumettes. It was on the small drier side with a southern hot sauce.\n4. Panang curry mussels. The sauce was okay but the mussels meats were a bit overcooked and small. Felt like another one of those frozen prepackaged ones.\n5. Mini cheeseburgers. The patties were pretty dry.\n6. Coastal salmon. That’s one thing about sockeye salmon, once overcooked it will be dry and powdery, needed some mastery skill to get this dish done right.\n7. Cajun chicken linguini. The sauce was okay but the linguini was a bit undercooked.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was casual but the noises projected from the bar section were quite loud.\nThe service was okay and pretty straightforward from the staffs, tho could be a bit more attentive.\nAs for the food, more of an old school pub style and a little on the drier side.

The restaurant had nice piped in music - the kitchen was playing R \u0026 R and the staff was singing to it.  (Really - you can't come up with a better division of kitchen/dining area).\n\nSecond - Even after changing table the acoustics were disappointing.  I couldn't hear my guest most of the time.  They had a baby grand in one corner and I hear that they have live music on Friday nights (god help anyone that visited this place then)\n\nStaff - Yes they were understaffed and our waitress did the best she could given the number of patrons in the restaurant on that night.  Can't fault her for that's on management.\n\nFood - I had a traditional Greek Dish and it was fine BUT I am glad that I had the Greek Salad in a separate bowl cause my whole plate would have been swimming in oil if it hadn't.  Why did they have a soak the cukes, tomatoes, etc in a vat of olive oil and then dump it on the plates.  ???? Oh I know - no culinary class\n\nAND THEN THERE WAS THE DESERT - I ordered the New York Cheese Cake.  BEWARE they don't make the deserts they serve and they have no idea what goes into them. ATTENTION STAFF - It is called a ingredient list and I am sure your supplier would give you one if you asked.  I am sure I tasted coconut in the crust of the Cheese Cake (the waitress couldn't confirm) and by the way I was sick to my stomach the next day I am sure that there was coconut in the crust.\n\nSo no I won't be going back to there.

The floors, windows,. food, utensils, napkins on the floor, and even the tables were not cleaned. Our condiment bottles were even kind of gross. So that alone was bad enough. And it wasn’t busy. So someone could have been at least tidying up. Then they had country music playing quite loudly. Which I am not a fan of country. But I dealt with it. Lastly, the food. It wasn’t bad. My rice was bland. But that was my only complaint. My husband didn’t like the gravy. But again, not a big deal. So the food so far would have us come back. But my concern is, if the dining room is that dirty, what does the kitchen look like!?? So that is my only hesitation to return there. I will probably try it again.

There was so many mishaps this particular Friday night from screwing up the reservation to running out of steak. Servers not remembering to bring items requested. I realize the restaurant was busy on this particular occasion however there is no consistency on how this place runs on day to day as same goes for food quality. There is no consistency week to week.\n\nExamples of the evening: Ordered yam fries which came out and served cold… reheated to be served overcooked\nOrder placed for a steak but sold out so replace with prime rib which was served cold and under whelmed with cooking of it..\nOrder placed samosa appetizers, asked for a sweet dipping sauce was offered plum.. I am allergic to pitted fruits so declined.. server argued back there’s no pit in the sauce…asked for sweet chili dip was given hot sauce asked again for sweet chili sauce and took 30 minutes to get a dip for 2 small samosas.\n\nI do commend the atmosphere or vibe of the place because the changes made to the building show some nice growth and opportunities towards improvement."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Anastassiya Kunitsyna"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUtvTKMqeWu6OVW3uNRzqNVD2yKDfmNlPsgC5aGS1stmGlnbwk=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had a Christmas party with our coworkers, and everyone really enjoyed it.

Let's talk first about the portions of different items on the plate. Over 95% of restaurants, mall food courts, takeout places and other eating establishments will fill your meal (plate, gyro, sandwich, wrap etc.) with fillers. This takes the form of all the cheaper items such as rice, pasta, hashbrowns, bread and other simple carbs. This place does not! It is the first restaurant in years where we did not have to request \""easy on the carbs\"" and \""more meat please\"". The portions on our plates where perfectly balanced with rice, salad and lots of meat (see photos for details).\n\nThe before-meal Greek salad was very tasty with was not overloaded with onions. The Bruschetta was wonderful with light perfectly toasted bread. The Mixed Grill was an excellent way to experience three meats: chicken, beef and lamb. All meats were moist. The chicken and beef were tastier than the lamb. Please note that the lamb is not the same as Roast Lamb and instead is the lamb likely used for Gyros. If we're being picky, this lamb could have used a bit more flavour. The rice and mixed vegetables were perfectly sized and with tons of flavour. Even the pita slices were warm with drizzle of oil.\n\nService was excellent even with a slight language barrier. Do not be deterred by South Asian staff and chef in a Greek restaurant. The Chef has over 10 years experience in cooking this type of food and it shows! It appears to be a family-run business. There was adequate street parking directly in front of the restaurant and a free parking lot across the street (which was mostly empty during the lunch hour). We felt that our meal was very reasonable given the portion sizes and taste. We shared an appetizer and ordered two meals (one from lunch menu and one from dinner menu). We did not have any drinks other than water. With taxes, the total meal was $52 not including a tip.\n\nThe restaurant has been open for 9 months. They have over 500 Google reviews. We hope they stay. It is simply outstanding and you should give it a try!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNQ9We5CoKH0WRTWGcsxTC_raymMN6WD9aK79Te\u0026fid=0x0:0x73d141e3ab072493""],""When"":""2024-7-23""},{""Name"":""Cayden Gillies"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK-qMY7VbcVg2__MwHI9cGdDcZkgGsaRwvmpR0qTWVodE6vyA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service was really excellent.

The dishes were a 10000/10, taste and presentation wise. We are true admirers of Greek food and this restaurant by far, exceeded our expectations, and we have eaten at many others! This will be our new go-to for dining in if we crave Greek food. Great to know their location is only 10 minutes away from home. We are a bit shocked that there are negative comments about the restaurant because even when it came to our baby, the host (which I feel was also the owner) made sure he was taken care of. We were given a high chair, his own plate, cup, and even a book and popsicle after he ate! For me, that’s great customer service! I highly recommend for others to give this another shot. Maybe it will work out better for you this time around as it seems they really took all your constructive feedbacks to heart; to better improve their business! We love, love, love Ella’s Greek. I have inserted photos for new customers to enjoy. I wish I can upload the video but Google is not making that possible. Thank you for treating us well.

Food was ready in a decent amount of time. About 30 minutes for takeout. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They had a few people waiting around dinner time.\n\nThe chow mein was average, the barbecue pork fried rice was great and full of flavor but had an insane amount of peas, the almond chicken was good with an unusual twist, they sprinkle sugar on top, in all my years of ordering Chinese food no one else has done that. They blend the sugar with the crushed almonds for the topping. It reminds me of the sugary coating on donuts. It actually tasted pretty good.\n\nI was not a fan of the honey garlic pork. My usual place in Surrey puts on a generous coating of sauce leaving a pool of sauce in the bottom of the container. They're all sticky and dripping with flavor and you can spoon the excess sauce in the container over the food on your plate. But the honey garlic pork at this place was almost dry. I couldn't taste the honey or garlic at all.\n\nI also wasn't a fan of the size of the pork pieces in the honey garlic pork. For me the smaller the better. I like the nice crispy ones. The pork chunks here were very large. I got a few super long ones the size of chicken strips. They should be diced much smaller. The pieces were so large it just wasn't appetizing. The chunks look like chicken wings.\n\nThat spring rolls I guess are hit and miss. We ordered two. One was perfect nice and crispy and the other one was completely soggy. I don't know what happened there.\n\nOverall I think their prices are just a bit too high for what you're getting."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOcUIp0jf3EaOI6OSoFptclS72dZDw-s3hAd1dx\u0026fid=0x0:0xc33fb80dba01832d""],""When"":""2022-6-28""},{""Name"":""Liuyi anne Zhou"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJPeMXbzK_zxfQcTdoZbLil-2cY-Ve-4rCHrHE9xb_WljZHc6I=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went to this place and the people were so kind to me the food was great I got the BBQ pork fried rice it has so much flavor and it was just so delicious I also had the egg rolls and they weren't too greasy which is great and they tasted awesome I totally recommend this to others"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Happy Travels"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW8gwB52_vB4Z1eS3qVA02GQnIsvYEL83tvsPSkH0k1kn-TBwEJ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Ordered here first time in along time.

The food today was just barely warm and not hot. The meat was dry and clearly just kept on the \""hot\"" table prepped from hours before.

Ordered a half \u0026 half pack, which ended up being quite a lot of chicken. It took a few minutes (they made it fresh) but was well worth the wait. Deliciously crunchy, but not greasy.\n\nRestaurants have gradually been raising prices while dropping quality and shrinking portions. It was pleasantly surprising to find such good portions (it is $27 for one box so not exactly cheap but you don't feel scammed).\n\nWorth going back to try more flavors next time.\n\nThe only issue I had was with young (under 8) kids in the dining area the staff decided to blast 'In and Out' by Lud Foe (a heavily explicit, uncensored rap song). The music was also beyond loud for a restaurant.

That's ridiculous considering they do take out only. The options on the machine were 15, 20 or 25 percent.\n\nFood was very tasty. The service was nice. The restaurant has been closed for dine-in since covid began. We called for takeout on New years Eve and there was only a 20-minute wait. They were out of some toppings and called back to ask if it was okay if they skipped it. Of course they didn't offer a discount for missing one topping. But they sure don't hesitate to charge if you add a topping.\n\nLasagna was very good. Lots of cheese. It came with garlic bread. The pizza was average. My husband got the barbecue chicken pizza. He loves getting barbecue sauce in place of pizza sauce. In this case you could barely taste the barbecue sauce. Also the bacon on this pizza was really gnarly and my husband spit it all out.\n\nI ordered pepperoni and bacon. I was disappointed that the pepperoni was like bologna sheets under the cheese. I prefer the Pizza Hut style with the crispy, greasy 1 inch diameter slices on top of the cheese not the fat 6 inch wide sheets of meat that look like bologna placed under the cheese. I guess it's just a personal preference.\n\nOddly enough the bacon on my pizza was delicious. You can really taste the smoky flavor. When we compared our slices you could tell the bacon on my pizza was completely different than the bacon on my husband's. Not sure what happened there. His was awful, gnarly and grayish in color. Mine was pink. Strange.\n\nI parked in front of the restaurant where they have street parking. It's usually hard to find a parking along the street.

Although I would love to support this business because they offer to feed the homeless... I just... I can't. I called to order for pick up, after giving all the order details I get hung up on. I call again to confirm the order, to again, get hung up on. After calling several times to recieve nothing but their voicemail, I tried calling from another phone, just to recieve their voicemail. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, that their having phone issues, that they received the order details and that it'd be ready in about 20-25 minutes. I get there, and they have a mask required sign in the window- which I respect. I put my mask on, and go inside just to see that absolutely no one is wearing a mask, let alone gloves for handling food. I ask for my order, and they say they never input the order because they couldn't confirm. They tried saying that they called me to try to confirm but got voicemail. However, I was by my phone(s) the entire time I was waiting. I called them on their lie and they were silent. Nevertheless, I ordered again and waited patiently. However, within that time I noticed that the place is filthy - every spot that the customer could see is clean, although when looking closer there is dust and insects in all the nooks and cranies. After receiving my food they said they were having technical difficulties and had to use the debit machine from the business next door. As long as I paid for what I received, I don't care.\n\nHOWEVER, I'm once again let down and disappointed from them when I get home. I asked for spicy butter chicken and it is the most bland butter chicken I've ever tasted. Lacking all seasoning and flavor. All I can taste is the yogurt. Their Naan is more like flat, tasteless, pancakes than actual Naan. Veggie pakora is also tasteless. Only flavor I taste is in the sauce.\n\nWon't be coming back. Highly disappointed.

Apparently they clean their entire kitchen so it's safe for celiacs like me to eat their pierogies.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of seeing the post, I messaged the business by leaving a comment about how I wish I had known about them earlier because the cut off time had already passed to place a gluten-free order for the week. Within 2 hours, I received a response and they let me squeeze in an order because I live in Las Vegas, USA.\n\nTwo days later I flew up North and drove our rental car to pick up pierogies after sitting in Vancouver traffic. We made it 20 minutes before they closed and they had my frozen order waiting for me. I saw that they also sell a gluten-free pork sausage for $7 CAD (precooked I believe) and added that to my order.\n\nWe had a kitchen in our time share so I cooked up the sausage. It was very nice. I brought a cooler picnic basket with me through the airport full of ice. Because I have Celiac disease, I can bring food with me on planes. Security checked it and luckily, the pierogies are professionally packaged, labeled and sealed so I was able to bring them across the border.\n\nI believe we paid $16 CAD for 12 pierogies. We got 12 garlic lovers and 12 delux that are seasoned with feta and bacon in the mashed potato filling.\n\nThe instructions were clear and accurate. They were easy to cook once we got off the airplane.\n\nIf you're Celiac, preorder from them. I don't know of a single place in the States that even offers gluten-free pierogies, so this is likely your only chance!\n\nVisited: April 2024"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM6C08OqboGv0jjfCp_rby2YVTNEIA734rsUFln\u0026fid=0x0:0xe24f9eb92ae6477d""],""When"":""2024-4-22""},{""Name"":""Scott Perry"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXA62UgdjYO9FAc0ZgOmsWeN-u7IMpZi09R1jSwr4rklxDZlO9l=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Recently my wife and sisters ordered a large order that was being picked up by my sister from the Fraser Valley and driven to my home in E Van but part of the order was not grabbed as part of our total order that we were going to serve for a family reunion type of meal.\n\nVeronica's son, Logan, drove into E Van on a dark, rainy evening (in Canucks game traffic!) plus they added some treats and other products to the order!\n\nUnbelievable service - going the extra miles to keep customers happy (and it's fabulously yummy food)!\n\nWe're so grateful for this company!!

I asked for the happy meal and fries and she gets me the happy meal and than says you didn't order 5 meals even though I did have 5 drinks. So I said I ordered 4 meals and 2 cheeseburgers and a medium fries and medium drink she gets super rude and goes and gets her manager. The manger comes over and says you didn't order. So I said than I need to buy one and she gets super rude rolls her eyes starts arguing with me than slams the drive thru window as hard as she can and goes and grabs me my fries. I don't know why they have to be so rude. I always thought McDonalds was about good customer service. It was a medium fries that they didn't hear me order so I said I would pay. I don't understand why I had to be treated so horrible . My husband goes here almost every morning for the first 2 weeks we lived here for breakfast but since they never had McGriddles he stopped going there at all.

The last thing I want to do is write this complaint, but my experience at your drive-through about 45 minutes ago definitely warrants sharing.\n\nThe girl at the drive-through, wearing a brown sweatshirt and large glasses, was rude while we placed our order. My son had changed his mind mid-order, which seemed to confuse her. I thought she was adding a second meal rather than replacing the first one, so I tried to clarify by repeating everything. She abruptly snapped at me, almost yelling, \""I got it!\"" Her reaction took me by surprise, and even my son, who usually stays calm, was shocked.\n\nWhen we got to the window, I mentioned that I found her response rude. Instead of apologizing, she got defensive and agitated. When I asked for her name so I could speak to her supervisor later, she refused to give it and then slammed the window shut.\n\nI visit Aldergrove regularly, staying weeks at a time, and switched to McDonald’s for my coffee from the Tim Hortons across the street because of the incredibly delightful service I receive from Brian at the drive thru. I recognize that working the late shift is unpleasant and difficult, as I too have recently done graveyard shifts in a restaurant, however,. that is not a reason for attitude towards paying customers.  I genuinely think this young lady could benefit from some customer service training from someone like Brian.\n\nAs a Punjabi person with years in hospitality and service, it really frustrates me to see rude comments about us on social media.

Honestly disrespectful, one person I would like to highlight was grace she was rude taking my order ruder serving my food and had some of the worst body language displayed I have ever seen. She repeatedly rolled her eyes, scoffed at my order, and had no sense of urgency I was waiting at least 10 Minutes to order, all I was getting was a refill on my drink and a hamburger using my monopoly game piece. The customers around me would agree and had very similar experiences. When I received my hamburger it was clearly sitting there for a long time the Ketchup was all the was trough the bun soaking it, while the top bun was as hard as a rock sitting under the heater for too long.

I got a bunch of TINY and hard as rocks pieces of Chicken Strips instead of 4 actual normal sized Chicken Strips! If you tried to bite the pieces you could end up with broken teeth in fact! When I took the food back in to get a refund the manager Robyn did apologize and give me my refund, however, his explanation was that the Franchise reduced the size of all \""dips\"" and \""gravy\"" due to inflation raising their costs... and the Chicken Pieces was the fault of \""suppliers\"".

There was no cleaning staff at 6pm, so I actually had the front desk give me their mop, and I cleaned the entire room myself when I got there because they had no other room available. There was very clearly fecal matter on the wall under the toilet paper holder, so I went to the grocery story conveniently across the street for some bleach, and I spent a couple hours washing everything I could before I felt comfortable enough to sleep there.

Which most people will agree on.\nNow the comparison. There is a Panago Pizza at the Abbotsford Canucks hockey food court, which we have had several times. It has been good every time, right up there with my favorites. We have had the New York Deli and Hawaiian, both were cooked nicely and a good balance toppings. The Hawaiian has more than the standard load of cheese with a nice pull to it as you would expect. The Deli was good, period. They both had a nice chew with some exposed crust for you bread lovers, but not a jaw workout.\nSo.....we figure the local Panago must be the same, it is a franchise after all?! Simply put, the pizza was hard work to chew and the toppings were just not up to a standard I expect anywhere. Cooked a bit much on the bottom then gets doughy and tough as it progresses thru to the toppings. Should they not be able to replicate a franchise standard? I hope they can fix their issues, maybe I got a bad dough day......\nNo I won't be back and no I don't want anything."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sandra Vleeming"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIG1qVUP-bTaTnRkR2Vt1QZDJ6h0TXVO7kR_EJ_MKQQpgLLNg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""This has been the worst experience.

Some of the BEST Indian food I've ever had and that says a lot as I grew up with it living where I do. Initially, my boyfriend and I were going to get a light meal from a Japanese restaurant but we ended up parking nearby other places. So we figured why not check them out! We hadn't had Indian food in a restaurant in a month and decided to go with Vaades. And we did not regret it. It exceeded our expectations for being a spontaneous choice. Although it was humid walking in since there was no ac, we forgot about it after drinking a glass of water. Our server was friendly and accommodating, and happy to fulfill any requests. For instance, extra sauce, more napkins, water refills. We felt taken care of and I loved the small touch of the utensils being wrapped in thick napkins, minus the clear tape. The washroom was also clean and spacious. Now on the topic of what really matters, the food: I ordered the baingan bharta, my boyfriend got the lamb and onion curry, and we shared the crunchy okra because we've never seen anything like it. They piled our food high! You can call it a plating issue but we were ecstatic to receive such a great portion with how delicious it was. The starter was in small crispy pieces and had a lovely sauce to accompany it. My curry was so creamy, had my preferred spice level and my naan was cooked perfectly and fresh. I ended up packing my leftovers for work and it tasted just as good the day after. We will definitely be returning here again when we're in the area. I would give it a 4.5 star rating if I could :)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM0XD_Ej81c7eZVbv1Z58gY_l05bSu-5CoLFI6o\u0026fid=0x0:0xe007072e6d585b59""],""When"":""2022-8-6""},{""Name"":""possible dreams"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWxIa3BzWqnXDQUO8jtY20RLIc-e_dcFVWRfnXKg4PTTzFJReRSSA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Had an early dinner here with my kids and the food was delicious !

I love Indian food but have never eaten here before today ...but will again very soon I'm sure . We had Pistachio curry chicken , a baked white fish , tandoori chicken , basmati rice, garlic naan and Papadum . I always though I didnt like Tandoori chicken but after having it here...I LOVE it . The white fish was so perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spice and the pistachio chicken was mouth watering ...had a sauce that was great with the rice. We all just drank water so I cant report on beverages.  There was some traditional music playing in the background and it was a lovely time spent catching up with my kids who took me here for a late birthday meal . Oh and I love chandeliers...they have mini ones for lighting:) They are located in a small shopping complex with some parking .

Seriously amazing menu filled with excellently-made dishes that focus on flavour over trendiness etc. To read the menu, it just looks like something similar to IHOP or Denny's or other breakfast joints, but what came to our table was like a lesson in Canadian eating, whatever that is.

We went here on Weekends for lunch, so this is reviewed for that timeframe. The lady server is very polite and welcoming. Apparently, she is the only one welcoming people while setting up and cleaning tables, making transactions and assisting customers. There is one male chef who prepare the meals. The food, to our standard, is good. We enjoyed the various dishes available, and the food are generally made well. The cleanliness of the place is clean. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and there is calming music playing in the background. The interior décor and bathroom is, well, basic. The price is reasonable for what is provided. Be warned that if you waste food, they will charge you $10 extra, so take only one scoop or piece if this is your first time trying. I notice many say this place isn't good. We all have our expectations of how something should be, and with a buffet like this, don't expect anything big like Cascades' buffet. There are other buffets in the region to try if this isn't for you.

Omni, where we had the pleasure of being assisted by Luke, was nothing short of excellent. His service was top-notch. Very attentive and gave us a good bit of knowledge on how certain things came to be on the menu.\n\nThe food was amazing. Super glad we began with the starter chicken bites as the house sauce was delicious. Moving onto the main courses, the cajun honey glaze mac \u0026 cheese with beef was incredibly filling and had the perfect amount of spice in it to give it a bit more flavor. Very heavy, but so tasty.\nThe chicken Parmesan was also cooked very well. Not my meal, but I had bites and I definitely would order it myself.\n\nI think that Luke and company have something really special here and I am very eager to come on back and try something else."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOGb8n7ae8J1saMml4QcGYMtnrVwlujcowe2Gw0\u0026fid=0x0:0xb69e31edfea8c6f5""],""When"":""2024-10-20""},{""Name"":""mikayla schneider"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK9ytTAwuelhxrLWhPzheXBmt7RewcKxL5Xs2Lokw9VuE5vgQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Paige was incredible today!My girlfriend and myself have had some questionable dining experiences lately, and Omni was a refreshing new place for us.

There's bocconcini which has a goat cheese like flavor with mozzarella notes which added to the overall experience. The garlic oil added to the overall taste and wasn't overly oiled. The chef did a fantastic job balancing these elements together.\n\nThe spicy chicken burger had small notes of spice which accentuates the chicken. The burger has a great balance of vegetables and was well seasoned.\n\nThe Omni burger was the highlight, the bacon was well cooked without being oily. The smash burger was correctly smashed and was well seasoned. The patty was very fresh as was the bun.\n\nThe truffle fries were spot on and amazing, the poutine was well made but the bowl style plate made the poutine suffer. If the poutine had a wider bowl, the top cheese curds would have been able to melt better. But the curds that did melt was really good.\n\nThe peach Bellini was sweet but might have been a bit too muddy for my liking, but if you prefer a more alcoholic experience, this is perfect.\n\nTheir signature drinks like the electric blue was amazing and definitely worth returning to have again.\n\nOverall the food is really well made especially with the price point, it's clear that this establishment has put extra care in delivering quality food.\n\nSome bonuses to note was that there is dairy free, and gluten free options, including plant based patties and plant based options for pizza too.\n\nFinal notes: A quality place, one of the only places you can get a good smash burger. I would consider this place more of a restaurant than a bar, I would consider the food too good to be considered bar food. Additionally, I believe they should advertise and highlight their smash burger as not many establishments provide smash burgers. The chicken burger is excellent and my co-reviewer even preferred it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPHJ7aeBqWUqh1JaZh2Y8LzcZsqmL9Qq038Phss\u0026fid=0x0:0xb69e31edfea8c6f5""],""When"":""2024-10-1""},{""Name"":""Ursula Galvão"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXnsRxiZN0DybNpuvqmxWQWm-edIin_sVOWzR85r44e8kPLlSM5=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Incredible food and service.

Let me state up front that this place definitely earns a 5/5 on G maps: stands out amongst the crowd of Indian restaurants around just because of one dish.\n\nBut before I get to that, let me get the not so great out of the way. The appetizer I had (I think it was the lollipops but I'm not sure — pic attached) was a solid 6.5/10. Spicy, sweet, salty, savory, but not much else going on in terms of flavor. It was somewhat tender though.\n\nThali was a 7/10. Lentil curry was good but not great. The chicken curry makes up for it though.\n\nTheir magnum opus and what keeps me coming back is their Biryani as many of their G maps reviews mention. NINE POINT FIVE out of 10 with sauce even after coming here multiple times but 6.5/10 without sauce. Seriously, use a generous portion of the white sauce; it's included and refills are free.\n\nI would say that Indian spice profiles are high risk, high reward. If you mess up, the food will taste disgusting even to the most unpicky eaters (I'm one of those). But if you nail it, the dish will take you to flavor town and back; and back to flavor town and back. And this restaurant nails it with their Biryani.\n\nIn addition, their rice is always perfectly cooked: fluffy and soft, yet the grains are individually separated and not falling apart. It's just a bit dry, but that makes it perfect when paired with curry or sauce (as you should) as it won't get mushy as easily.\n\nThe atmosphere is adequate: clean, and there's signs of effort placed into aesthetics. It's definitely not fine dining.\n\nServing size: huge. Expect to be full after only an entree. They can definitely serve 1.5-2 people.\n\nSummary: definitely come here for Biryani if you want some Indian food without destroying your wallet with those Michelin recommended restaurants."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMwps4_fdX4YjQlgVqT04e8Of9DFXlLJMVfYrE\u0026fid=0x0:0x97c7d84b6caacd36""],""When"":""2024-3-3""},{""Name"":""vishnu viswanathan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkkvVnC4XYZ0OswhnAV1UJR62w5i_u7SRPGRlZgiLQTTivcWcp=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I ordered chicken 65 biriyani for a group.\nAbsolutely loved the Chicken 65 Biryani!

It was supposed to be a special occasion for my niece’s birthday.\n\nThe food was below average. We ordered two community plates to share amongst the 6 of us. Aren’t nachos supposed to have cheese?\n\nWe were sat for 43 mins before the food came out to us. I asked for plates as soon as the food came out and the server told us “it was in the dishwasher”. Not sure how long their dishwasher loads take, but they might want to consider switching up for a faster one, or buying more plates. We ended up eating on napkins. Not once were we checked on. There was no water served or plates given to us during our entire meal. The table next to us ended up cleaning their own table (pic below) because of the lack of service.\n\nWhen brought to the attention of the server, she decided to get argumentative about it and make excuses. We asked for the manager, but no manager on-site (convenient). Spoke to a shift supervisor who continued to make excuses (as follows) for the horrible service and provide us with almost expiring coupons. Excuse #1: “you came during our busiest brunch hour” (the picture below shows how empty it was)\nExcuse #2: “We always wait for the customer to ask us for water and then bring it to the table”\nExcuse #3: “We’re human too” and on he went…\n\nThe one and ONLY restaurant I’ve been to where the word “sorry” is as scarce as the people at its busiest hour. If you’re the server or supervisor, you know who you are. I won’t mention your names, for your sake. Hope you’ll learn how to provide better customer service.

What made this place stand out to me was the quality of the meat; it had the taste and texture of a higher quality meat than you usually find in most places. The texture was actually a real meat texture; it felt rich, as opposed to something previously frozen and limp.

to enjoy Japanese cuisine. We have been coming here a couple times as a family and we enjoyed our experiences. The servers were welcoming and delightful, offering us the menu and drinks promptly.

The seating were comfortable and includes many walled, rectangular enclosed spaces. The food came out fresh and in generous quantity while maintaining quality in a timely manner. For the proportion we get and the freshness, the overall price is reasonable. The atmosphere is calm, soothing and laid-back. There is no overpowering music and no loud ambiance. The washrooms are generally clean and functional. After paying, we got little natural fruit candies.

The second waitress who took over was regrettably rude and unprofessional. Despite her assurance to refill our water twice, she never returned with it. Although we ordered promptly, we waited 35 minutes without any food. When we finally flagged down the waitress, she explained that there had been a mix-up as she assumed we had finished our meal. When our food finally arrived, it was a mixed experience. My wife's gnocchi was good, but my fish and chips were disappointing; the fish was undercooked and frozen, making it impossible to cut.

Personally a dill sauce would have been better.\n\nThe Artisan salad was fresh and crisp.  The amount of dressing perfect.\n\nThe salmon burger was good and came with nicely seasoned fries.\n\nOverall it was a good dining experience and we would dine there again."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN7UT8AOPYwRxdwCdsDZmRvHv55kTZyEaHmJeAU\u0026fid=0x0:0xfe43abe99f45cdb9""],""When"":""2024-7-1""}]",

spot while thrift shopping and thought we'd give it a try, especially since it saved us a drive. The place has been newly renovated, but the ambiance feels a bit empty. Service was a little off—we weren’t greeted or given menus, which made me wonder if they’re more of a takeout spot. I felt like we might have been intruding, though the staff did share a few friendly smiles.\n\nThe prices are a huge draw! They have specials like $2-3 slices of pizza and a mango lassi for just $2.50. I ordered the Chana Bhature and Chat Papdi—both were delicious, well-seasoned, and the portions were perfect! I couldn’t even get a photo before diving in—I took a bite of the Chat, and my friend took a bite of her dish (a chickpea curry, I think), because we were so excited to try. 🤣 She also picked up a slice of pizza to snack on, which was ready to go but tasted pretty average, like festival pizza.\n\nWe tried the mango lassi, which was lighter and a bit tangy compared to others I’ve had. I enjoyed it, but my friend, who’s Indian, found it bitter and not quite to her taste. At $2.50, it’s still a great deal, so no complaints there!\n\nOverall, I’d recommend this place for its great prices and tasty Indian dishes.

I miss having eggs and fried chicken, so I was pleasantly surprised to find specific vegan options here. The vegan egg was a solid substitute; while not exactly like the real thing, it was impressively close. The vegan sausage was decent, though it would be great if they offered dairy- and egg-free chicken sausage as well. The smash potatoes were my favorite, though next time I’ll remember to request them extra crispy.\n\nThe place was packed on a Sunday morning, but we were fortunate to snag a table as one opened up. With the rush, I hesitated to ask if items like the chicken sandwich could be made dairy- and egg-free or if the buns contained any allergens. Ideally, I would still like to enjoy chicken, bacon and some sandwiches if they can be made egg and dairy free. Might be wiser of me to call ahead next time. For anyone without dietary restrictions, the menu is an absolute treat, with plenty of mouth-watering options to choose from."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNxR2IJYsTiMg99iExxUEDcPq9Yc5Po6MQTyveL\u0026fid=0x0:0x145c8f4a8245af3a""],""When"":""2024-11-13""},{""Name"":""pranav malhotra"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUSL5eeGcXR0Jz-YBh5IzstngyuiPHOiOg7aMPejaDXK3jwMy1bDg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""A very inviting and attractive place with fantastic food and beverages.

Unfortunately, the coffee selection was disappointing—only drip coffee is available, which doesn’t quite match the overall quality of the place. However, the ambiance and quick service make up for this shortcoming. The photo spots were also a nice touch, adding a special charm to the venue.

The rim seasoning was delicious, and the little snack stick was quite hearty compared to other places.\n\nThe virgin ceaser, poke bowl, and lettuce wraps (lettuce wraps were an appy menu item) was over $50 before tip. (I believe it was low to mid $60 range.)\n\nLettuce wraps - the chicken was good, nice, and saucy. Personally, I'm not a fan of cucumbers, so I just kicked those to the side. Thoroughly enjoyed that it was ice berg lettuce vs. romaine hearts, etc. The mayo sauce was also delicious!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Poke Bowl and said it could have for sure used some more fish and rice for what we paid for it.

The dinner sets are also delicious, and such good value. The seafood salad is also delicious,  perfect for a solo entree.

Our waitress was watchful and attentive.  Dietary requirements are carefully considered and we appreciated the extra caution.  We were not rushed at any point.\n\nAs mentioned, the food is excellent.  A nod to tradition is notable in such items as the spring rolls wrapped in rice paper.

Good flavour to the ribs but the bowl could have used some other veggies.\n\nWe also had the seafood pancake. This had a thickish batter which was a bit crispy on the outside.  Inside, it was mainly veggies and not much seafood aside from the large chunks of octopus.\n\nThe spicy rice cakes that we ordered were tube-shaped (like tteokbokki) and slightly fried giving it a bit of texture to the bite.\n\nThe soy and garlic KFC bites were Boneless and quite meaty.\n\nOverall, food was pretty good but I kinda missed having actual banchan dishes"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPs_Di9fkj6279_KJJn6onIVJA5bnhlAsxLUtoz\u0026fid=0x0:0xcfe58da922a51b8d""],""When"":""2024-6-2""},{""Name"":""Pilo News"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFId9ZdkkvXmcYiLmTK0bEP9YVRba_LZHmLxWEpHSLdGMlepoT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Banchan’s chicken dishes are a standout, showcasing a perfect balance of flavor and tenderness.

November I returned after a more traditional experience = lasagna and Tiramisu; this was time to *try* something: Squash and Brie Canelloni and Canoli(last two pics.)\n\nThe Canelloni is an incredibly creative blend of flavors- truffle, maple, squash, brie, spinach- AND green apples on the side- not for a Normal-seeking palate. I had a Moment on first bites at the sheer range of flavors and how well they melded; I found it was really well done.\n\nI followed my entrée with a Canoli- I think fairly well done. It had more of a \""fair food\"" essence(fried) than I would seek out but I took my time and could definitely appreciate the rest of the flavors.\n\nService was pretty good, just depends who you get and how busy the restaurant is!\n\nI still enjoy the ambience- quieter music than previous time, apparently at some of the [few at that pre-supper hour] guests' requests, but noise has not been Loud either time. It's been a few weeks and I'm hoping to return[again] soon.\n\nPrevious review, Nov. 8th, 2024:\nIf you want details on food, server and atmosphere(and first two pics.):\n\nI ordered the lasagna and, as mentioned in answer to one of the questions here, I found it smaller than I expected(takes up space width-wise but is shorter than what I expect from lasagna) and tasty!! So, a bit confusing on that note, and for $31+/-.\n\nI finished with Tiramisu- the lasagna was easy, and then I found the mousse quite heavy(kind of to be expected...ish) that, while the flavor was soo good it was hard to put the spoon down(!), I didn't get very far before taking the server up on a take-home box. I enjoyed some warm tea for the heavy mousse later. 😄(Lasagna gone before thoughts of a pic. dawned on me!)\n\nServer Keira was just right in not hovering but also attentive enough to ask how it was as I progressed and promptly notice I needed a water refill. Her table-side manners were so approachably professional that I was quickly at ease- and at Friday supper time!\n\nWarm but modern design inside- balance between low-grade pub and stiff-and-expensive. Lower lighting this Fall eve., but brighter for window-side tables. Music loudER but it wasn't overwhelming as I thought when I walked in the door. 👌\n\nI would like to try other dishes- cannelloni, pizza?? And mayyybe another dessert in the near future? 🤤🍽"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPe5WGld991JNFkPAdN0SZSA11X7gUGjVSe5oLX\u0026fid=0x0:0xa8a72d1e570d4071""],""When"":""2024-11-9""},{""Name"":""Debbie Tuit"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUl1QRhiGTE0pawpm2Mt3BIssODHhrthbrxd62Ea1dwXPs0h0E=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Cannot say enough about this fabulous restaurant.\nWe are staying nearby and walked over just as the restaurant opened.

Good value overall.\n\nWe started with the Truffled fries which were excellent with the sauce on top of it.  My son and I had the fried chicken sandwich dish and my wife had the Ohana bowl.  We traded bites and both dishes were superb.  The fried chicken was crunchy and had lots of flavor.  The dressing they had on the chicken burger really complemented it.  Even the brioche bun was high quality.  The mix of flavors and textures in the Ohana bowl were tasty and complementary.\n\nMy Spicy Guava Margarita was excellent.\n\nThe Peanut Butter Raspberry Cheesecake with Vanilla ice cream we shared deserves special mention.  I have had many desserts in my 55 years of life but I can honestly tell you this, it was definitely one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life.\n\nThe decor is tasteful and very relaxing.

Katsuya in Langley!\""\n\nIf you're looking for a meal that delivers on both quantity and quality, look no further than Katsuya in Langley. Their pork cutlet isn't just a meal—it's an event. The portions are so generous you might find yourself wondering if you're supposed to share (spoiler: you're not, it's all yours).\n\nThe set menu is the real star of the show, offering an unbeatable combo of great taste and wallet-friendly pricing. You get a perfectly crispy, golden-brown tonkatsu that's tender on the inside, accompanied by a lineup of sides that will have you feeling like you’ve just won a flavor lottery.\n\nWhether you're fueling up for a big day or simply treating yourself, Katsuya strikes the perfect balance between indulgence and value. Pro tip: bring your appetite (and maybe stretchy pants)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNFSgY7Qw0TI4_FF_Knyw5QWoOn1h6jOF3B4Ipd\u0026fid=0x0:0x7549bf650c090cbe""],""When"":""2024-12-19""},{""Name"":""Bala888"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKwpXKXLnWVbmRWE49mxf-yYsdsA4jpYsnTuSzc7_Jf6iiW=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""First time here everything looks good on menu.

She said “yes it’s the juicy pork dumplings in the dim sum menu” I looked and clarified they are the pork dumplings with the soup inside. “Yes” she replied.\nOk I’d like 2 orders. I arrive 25 min later, then I drive home and I get them open and go to eat them realizing the dough is all torn up, they put plastic containers of vinegar in with the hot dumplings so the lid melted and the vinegar spilled all over, and there was not 1 single dumpling that was sealed. When you see these pictures, I wouldn’t even serve them to my dog! This is not even the biggest piss of though. This is WHY I’m writing a review. I called the restaurant and told them I would send pictures. She stated I needed to return the food in order to get a refund. The restaurant is a 40 min drive. Then she proceeded to tell me I did not order Xiao long bao and that those are Chinese not Cantonese, when we CLEARLY had that EXACT conversation on the phone. It wasn’t until I wasted my gas at almost 2$ per liter to drive the dumplings back up to her, that she gave me back my money. Not 1 penny more.

Can't say I got my worth this time but at least I got the chance pick berries. Detailed review below:\n\nBurnt ends (1 lb) - I think this was a borderline scam.  I was excited for brisket burnt ends, but all I got were super small cubes of brisket flat that were not caramelized but just covered in sauce - you just see that naked grey coloured meat covered in red sauce.  However the worst part is (you can also see in the photo) that it was 70% sausage.  I don't understand what justifies the price they are selling at, $27.99.  The sauce was pretty good though.\n\nBeef rib - Singular rib that had smoke flavor but was dry and needed the barbeque sauce.  Overall, impressive looking but was not it, $31.99\n\nPlatter for 2 - Got this the last time and the star of the show was the pulled pork, last time it was the brisket that was juicy, smokey, and moist.  However, this time the brisket was dry and lacking smoke flavour.  The sausages were plentiful as always.\n\nMac n cheese side - Saw it being made fresh, nice southern flavor with smokey spices. Overall, it feels like a Velveeta based cheese sauce with smoked paprika.\n\nCornbread (jalapeno) - Nice fluffy, moist, and flavorful cornbread, but no jalapeno flavor, not complaining but there's almost no difference from a regular one. Kind of unfortunate that I liked the cornbread more than the brisket and beef rib this time around."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNRm0Lpp7OrziOMUDrC2MxSIwf628NWaDxniiT9\u0026fid=0x0:0xc337a3f74351b29""],""When"":""2023-7-28""},{""Name"":""Kelsey McAuley"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKnAzavtz8qT6KmCgwueB6IQD6a-EXZK-ht_DFi_J60y91Dtw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is the closest thing to true Texas BBQ in the greater Vancouver area that I have ever tried.

The inside seating seems more of an afterthought and the place is showing wear and tear.  One particularly bothersome part of our meal was the flying insects.

Here’s a fun and inviting Google review for The Mad Italian:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n“The Mad Italian: Where Pizza Dreams Come True”\n\nIf pizza is your love language, The Mad Italian is your soulmate. I walked in expecting a meal, and I left feeling like I’d just had a spiritual awakening (but with way more cheese).\n\nThe pizza? Unbelievable. I’m pretty sure they’ve hired a wizard in the kitchen because I can’t explain how they’ve managed to make crust this perfect. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside—it’s like biting into a cloud that’s also been to culinary school.\n\nAnd the service? Out of this world. I thought I was a regular person, but after five minutes, I was convinced I was royalty. The staff treat you like long-lost family, the kind you actually like.\n\nDo yourself a favor: Stop reading reviews and get to The Mad Italian. You’ve got pizza dreams that need fulfilling, and this is the place that can make them come true. You’ll leave full, happy, and slightly convinced you’ve found the meaning of life—hint: it’s pepperoni and their house made ranch dipping sauce and chilli oil!\n\nP.S.

They have a wide selection of different variations of “pies”. My go-to being, the Margherita or Vegetarian (love the freshness the arugula gives). I also appreciate how they have an option to create your own, although it’s not very obviously advertised. The only reason for the lack of the last star is that: one time I was ordering with someone who is gluten sensitive and we saw there was an option for them on the menu. Labelled as “gluten-friendly” or something of that sort, yet still contained gluten and wheat, just less. Long story short, they couldn’t enjoy the pizza with the rest of us because of false (or not clearly specified) advertisement.\n\nFeedback for the company: Ultimately, I believe that they shouldn’t bother with any gluten related titles. As it can be deceiving and potentially harmful. If they want to cater to that group, they could make one that is actually gluten free. In that case, cross contamination is of course understandable and should also be noted"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPlNmd8UTRerO9Ikk-8ZzTgQ8ApU9731lFl6jz4\u0026fid=0x0:0xa114619d66dfcfb3""],""When"":""2023-7-12""},{""Name"":""Chris S"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVmYHb_KmQh-jaUeScM_TxpeioRL8O096fWi7rSR_TSHEj6B5M=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""This is a weekend must for my wife and I.

It is with great disappointment that I express my complete lack of recommendation for this establishment. From unhygienic practices to disrespectful treatment, my visit left a lasting negative impression.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I observed three customers waiting for their meals at a table. As I stood at the bar, waiting to pay and receive my order totaling $110, I was approached by an older lady. In a hushed voice, she whispered, \""I wouldn't eat here. Look how disgusting that is!\"" She pointed to the owner, who was using a mop to wipe down the fan above the grill, with food still cooking directly below it. This unhygienic act raised serious concerns about the potential for cross-contamination.\n\nIn light of what I had witnessed, I politely approached a waiter and expressed my apprehension about paying for the food. As expected, he laughed at me and directed me to speak with the owner, who was conveniently seated nearby, eavesdropping on our conversation. To my utter dismay, the owner greeted me with a smirk and callously stated, \""That's just how we clean here,\"" as if my concerns were unwarranted. His mocking attitude made me feel unheard and invalidated.\n\nAttempting to explain the gravity of the situation, I emphasized that I have two children who depend on me for their meals. I expressed my deep discomfort in feeding them food that had been handled in such an unsanitary manner. However, the owner continued to dismiss my concerns and laugh in my face, showing a complete lack of empathy.\n\nFaced with such disrespectful treatment, I made the decision to leave the restaurant immediately. It is crucial to shed light on the unhygienic practices I witnessed at Zythos Mediterranean Grill. Cleaning the fan above the grill while there is raw food actively cooking below it is a clear violation of basic food safety and sanitation standards. This lack of regard for hygiene puts customers at risk of consuming contaminated food, which can lead to serious health issues.\n\nMoreover, I must highlight the unsettling reactions I encountered during my visit. Before entering the restaurant to address my concerns about payment, I had a conversation with another customer named Mariam. She claimed to be a frequent customer who knows the owner personally. I shared the video footage I had captured and explained the situation to her. Surprisingly, Mariam initially downplayed the issue, assuring me that the establishment is clean and that I should proceed to pick up my food. She even advised me to delete the video and refrain from posting it online, citing potential negative consequences for the business.\n\nIt is important to note that the waiter and the owner seemed to be aware of my intentions before I even approached them. This suggests that Mariam may have informed them about our conversation, further adding to the distrust and lack of transparency that I experienced as a paying customer.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to Zythos Mediterranean Grill was marred by unhygienic practices, disrespectful treatment, and unsettling reactions. It is my firm belief that the uncleanliness of the establishment and the disregard for customer concerns should never be tolerated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this restaurant to anyone, as the health and well-being of customers should always be the top priority."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNPjywBrLfYA-NnAv623KQt9w4PRPvRWwG1LOvZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x82bf87a3db20203d""],""When"":""2024-6-30""},{""Name"":""Ralph Wyatt"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUN28UZv5zBQyNqkHdh4edz4iBwoslU-5vQSp6k9ZPs8OvdAN6z=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had a gathering of 25 people in the group room.

Who doesn’t like cheap movie night and to keep things under budget we found Naomi with one of the cheapest bowls of Pho around. In this day and age you will definitely not find Pho for under $10 in Vancouver. The regular size (small) bowl of pho at Naomi is priced at a low, low price of $10! Now don’t expect to be stuffed as the bowl is small (similar size to what you’d actually get in Vietnam) but it’s a decent size if you’re just wanting to enjoy a light meal. If you’re hungry than get the large size or order some appys and share with your friends and family.\n\nI ordered my usual (Bun Bo Hue) and it’s decent here. I’m only saying that because if you’ve seen my other reviews I have high expectations for BBH and I have my favs around town.\n\nI am intrigued with their other menu items as they have Banh Xeo and Banh Cuon. I will definitely try one of these the next “movie night”.\n\nOverall a good experience with the food, service was meh as we didn’t receive much attention and no tea refilled.\n\nRay’s Tips:\nCheap Pho $10!\nFree Parking\nCredit card Accepted"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMwu9tBI4x2H4Vwi-t1UIPbZi099lx3og8UREFK\u0026fid=0x0:0x72fc0b51f114e524""],""When"":""2023-9-22""},{""Name"":""Atamjit Bassi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-CCAG1d3JAdmNUSxxvmUHR8304lfHA6Q1xca1y5nzjuQ4NkRBIw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Service was quick when we went in during peak lunch hours but food is mediocre.

We come here a couple times and generally, the service, food and atmosphere is satisfactory. We were welcomed and seated quickly. Tables and seating were clean and tidy. There are a variety of dishes to chose from, and we usually order the fried chicken, noodle and rice dishes. The servers were generally responsive though sometimes we waited for a while to get one of them attention. Food came out in a timely manner and it was made fresh. However, some of the food were difficult to eat like a salad side dish that had too much salt added in it. When ordering tea drinks, it comes within a take-out cup. The ambience can be a little loud due to the music, making having long and meaningful conversation difficult. One interesting issue is the men's bathroom door handle. I tried opening it but seem like it is locked. I also saw another customer try to open the door but was not successful and asked for help from a staff member. The staff were able to open the door, and there was no one inside the bathroom. There should be a label with instructions on how to open the bathroom door properly. Recently, they added a claw machine where every $10 you spend gets you one coin for one round to win a stuffed animal. It is more challenging than you think! Half of the front window were smashed and boarded up from a car accident, so half of the place is a bit darker. Pricing is reasonable. Interior is generally clean. I recommend this place if you want to enjoy causal Taiwanese cuisine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPaZOTZ_6bBpp2AT-Iv7mNTJ41D1kM-rqlF7UhK\u0026fid=0x0:0x6e6afd1d8b47365""],""When"":""2024-2-20""},{""Name"":""Ken K C Wong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWiE-ckZJVCFaTlgDnG--FRxoEP2J-yrm5Da1Ic4EFe5gyemnA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""They do accept credit card 2 weeks ago but not anymore.

donburi meal to go this evening. This comes with donburi, tempura, and a California roll. I requested no crab in the California roll. I even added a note saying that it was okay if this meant the roll was small. Because I requested this, I was charged an extra $5 ($4.88 to be exact). They said that this is because they had to make an avocado roll instead. However, no amount was deducted from the combo price. So, I was basically charged for the California roll twice as I paid for it as part of the combo PLUS I had to pay for an avocado roll. However, despite paying for both the California roll and the avocado roll, I was only given one roll. So, a dinky kid's meal ended up costing close to $20 for rice with a small amount of beef, three pieces of tempura, and an avocado roll that was just straight avocado. On top of that, they charged 50 cents for the take out bag, and there was no option to select no bag. Yes, they called my husband to discuss the extra charge as the online ordering account is in his name, but at the time, he was on a business trip in Ontario and was working, so he just said \""sure\"" in order to get off the phone and get back to work. I have been a longtime customer for close to 8 years, but I will definitely not be returning. There are a million other sushi places, so will be skipping this place in the future."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPR0J8TTkhhEfSH9Y07ayb2BixPt-JMUWnpbsw\u0026fid=0x0:0xdb59e9ef3ff47e35""],""When"":""2024-10-30""},{""Name"":""Amor Tamayo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL6z7Y5zt5KEsfemCwbC7OVrt5TARVZWg59cmpaNErLVUV5ufQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food, service and ambiance are amazing!!

sometimes difficult finding vegetarian friendly options that actually taste good, but wow there Impossible burger tasted amazing!

The burger was a bit pricey being that it was $11.99, but I'd say it's an experince because it was very big and tasty.

The bread wasn’t baked through, yeasty tasting. The Escargot was the highlight as an appetizer but it went all downhill from there. Waited over 40 minutes for entrees and they were tasteless. The veggies weren’t seasoned, carrots were hard as diamonds, garlic mash had no garlic and had a glue like consistency to it, definitely not how they used to do it. I know some places have a hard time with rare steak but it was cold to the touch and was mostly fat. The lobster was rubbery and overcooked, and the other was undercooked and almost slimey.
