The club was a bit messy/fell apart, fries were crisp and salted just right.

While it falls on the pricier side, the exceptional quality of the food more than justifies the cost.\n\nI visited on a Wednesday as a walk-in, and the owner, who was alone, was managing a constant flow of walk-ins and pickups. Despite the hustle, he immediately acknowledged my arrival, inquired about my order, and, to my surprise, had already started preparing my pizza while simultaneously working on another customer's order. A true multitasker! It was evident that he's a big NY Yankee fan, judging by the sizable logo proudly displayed on the wall.\n\nBeing a vegetarian, I did notice that the menu options were somewhat limited. It would be fantastic if they could consider incorporating vegetarian alternatives like a Cheeseburger, Buffalo Chicken, or Pesto Chicken without the meat and chicken but substituting it. Additionally, introducing options with 'Beyond Meat' could cater to those seeking healthier choices.\n\nTo top it off, Albion Pizzeria even offered ice cream. When I inquired about the small and large scoops, the owner mentioned that their large scoop is an equivalent to three scoops, unlike the standard two you'd find in many other ice cream parlours. I know my kids would be thrilled about  that!\n\nLet's get back to the pizzas....Despite the somewhat restricted vegetarian choices (4 pizzas), the exceptional taste of the pizza makes me eager to return without a doubt! I was so captivated by the pizza that I couldn't resist grabbing a slice before taking a photo of the entire pizza—that's how impressive it was!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTHkJyQzSrcufpfApTy-cNnPtbLxXcSggUseKj\u0026fid=0x0:0x9a3de7542d4571ba""],""When"":""2023-12-9""},{""Name"":""Joanne Walker"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLJ-skD3gNOCBq_Kpl45bWQPCFqoryaLNUEMcjTKCZ8ip4W0Q=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great customer service.

Got invited by friends to check out this quirky spot for all-you-can-eat Taco Tuesday, and I left with a pretty positive impression. Sure, the tacos are buffet-style, the simplest Tex-Mex you can imagine, but you can load up for just 11 bucks and change with no limit. Probably even better if you are having a few drinks too.

I wouldn’t recommend getting oysters here.\nThe burger tasted sort of good but it is thick and on the dry side. The fish and chips seemed to be the only dish that was enjoyed with no complaints.

4.9 in Surrey and 4.6 in Maple Ridge on Google Reviews, I decided to give this highly praised Indian restaurant a shot—and it didn’t disappoint.\n\nFrom the moment you step inside, it feels like you’ve been transported to India. The ambiance is authentic and immersive, making the experience even more special. Following the waitress’s recommendations, we ordered their signature Lamb Korma paired with the famous Garlic Naan, as well as the classic Butter Chicken served with Fries.\n\nThe flavors were rich and aromatic, exceeding my expectations. The Lamb Korma had an incredible depth of spices, while the Butter Chicken was a perfect blend of creamy and tangy flavors. Every bite was flavorful and satisfying, making it easy to see why this place has such high ratings.\n\nWould I come back? Absolutely! For anyone who loves curry or is curious about Indian cuisine, USTAADJ 76 is worth every visit."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOuhE4PDtYS7uE0jxMzxCeKTR_v2nxsq6C4J1w4\u0026fid=0x0:0x6ccf4a3eef0094e4""],""When"":""2024-12-2""},{""Name"":""Harjot Singh Thiara"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUzOWwYq4K3U1PHL-O7BVjU4O_407b0Owm7Wzd6z3KttiPqwyct=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Hi all, I would like to explain my recent visit to Ustad G76, We were group of eight, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. We ordered $150 worth of food, and every single item was spot on—delicious and perfectly prepared. I was particularly impressed by our server, Shagal, who must have a photographic memory. She effortlessly memorized each member's order and the necessary amendments, ensuring that everything came out exactly as we requested.\n\nA big thanks to Chef Harjap, who did an amazing job in the kitchen and truly made our day special. We enjoyed a delightful spread that included Kadai Paneer, Chana Bhatura, Pav Bhaji, two Veg Thalis, Veg Noodles, Paneer Malai Tikka, and dessert. The portion sizes were generous, far better than what you often find at other restaurants, where you might feel shortchanged.\n\nDuring the meal, we all sampled each other's food and were consistently amazed by the flavours. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to everyone—it’s truly great! A final shout-out to the restaurant owner for assembling such a brilliant team."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNfxj_Kb--lPZA12v6wUlKAUF_cGWY8Y8fVp4EX\u0026fid=0x0:0x6ccf4a3eef0094e4""],""When"":""2024-10-1""},{""Name"":""Just B"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbqlkGphBGO4ZFtnvvHRFErtzljMxdFcSC7D5K0agOlbgekAWrBA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Mmm so good.

The wings were fine, but the service absolutely tanked. It was a louder night, but not over all super busy. We were sat for over 30 minutes before seeing a waitress, she finally took our drink order and didn’t come back for another 25. If we had seen her running around the restaurant, we would’ve been more inclined to be more patient, as we understand things get busy. She passed us several times, each time without our drinks which could’ve easily been placed on her tray and dropped off. She’d run past our table, tap it and say she was grabbing whatever we had asked for or to take our order, but would take nearly 30 minutes each time to come back. We saw her maybe 3 times, and what should’ve been a quick in and out for some wings, we were there almost 3 hours, had only 1 drink refill and nothing else, never asked us if we needed anything, and you couldn’t catch her otherwise. Also, they cease to mention that pop refills are not free on Wednesdays, which seems like a scam to get you in the end. While it’s just pop, I understand, be upfront with customers so they can decide what they want to do with that information. It wasn’t until we asked for the bill (3 different times) that she finally came and had a second to stop and chat, to which she instantly brought up her children and Christmas coming, which to us felt like tip baiting.

The perfect way to try 3 different oshi sushi on one plate. I'd highly recommend the oshi bento - it's delicious and you get so much for $19. The popcorn roll was amazing and it comes with a salad, so it's practically a meal on its own.\n\nThe staff were incredibly friendly, which was just the cherry on top of the cake!\n\nUPDATE: we've been back multiple times since our initial visit and each time, it gets better (if that's even possible).

never had Korean fried chicken before and I kept hearing that this was the place to go. Words can’t describe how impressed I was but I’ll give it a shot.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and spacious and very well organized. There was only one person working (I’m assuming the owner) and he was very friendly and attentive. He also brought us a couple of glasses of water even though we did not ask for any which was very nice.\n\nWe decided to try 2 half orders of boneless chicken. One of their signature seasoned chicken and the other was the garlic pepper chicken. At $16.50 for a half order I have to say that they were massive portions! The chicken was boneless thigh meat in an insanely crunchy breading and tossed in these delicious, sweet and spicy sticky sauces.

The buffet offered a decent number of dishes, but the quality was hit-or-miss. For appetizers, there were only two options - tandoori chicken and samosa. Unfortunately, the tandoori chicken was dry and not impressive.\n\nThe main course had two chicken items, and the butter chicken was the highlight - it was flavorful and enjoyable. The vegetable mix was just average, and the rice was good. However, I was disappointed that they ran out of basic salad items like onions and cucumbers by 1:30 PM, and they didn't replenish them even after we asked. This was a letdown, especially since the buffet was supposed to be available until 3 PM.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience, and the price of $15 per person was reasonable.

Went for the Dinner Buffet. They have a lunch buffet every day I think. The dinner buffet is Friday through Sunday. Tasty food, seemed like good quality ingredients. With a nice variety of dishes. There was a lot of available seating and the place wasn't busy (2 other tables in use), which is why the service was kinda shockingly bad (there was a high staff to guest ratio). I think it might have been just bad luck, or maybe just the person responsible doesn't understand buffet service expectations. In my opinion, even at a buffet service is important. Plus it's an opportunity for the staff to earn tips to share with the kitchen etc. It would take much effort to really elevate the experience. Clearing the plates, bringing more water, asking if I wanted anything else to drink... I just didn't feel the care you want to feel eating out somewhere. Hope the owner / manager sees.

I have been eating Caesar salad’s for the past 20 years and thought it’s about time I get serious about these leafy greens covered in cream sauce. I hope your as excited as I am.\n\nPaliotti’s in Maple Ridge- only one other Italian restaurant to choose from\n\nDressing: creamy base, with a nice lemon coating, heavy garlic (yum), fresh ground pepper and anchovies. Can’t believe I’m saying this but maybe too much sauce.  Definitely tastes homemade though.\nLettuce: romaine, cold and crisp, however cut too large\nCroutons: out of a package\nCheese: questionable? Powdered parm on top but within the dressing a thicker heavier tasting cheese I couldn’t figure out.\nBacon: none- which is honestly how I prefer my Caesar’s. Bacon seems to over power the sauce and texture (to me)\n\nI went to this restaurant after 8 years of my mom passing away with my girlfriend. My mom always ordered penne alla vodka. I was searching all over Maple Ridge and could not find it on the menu. This place seemed the most authentic and warm. We obviously has to order the Caesar salad, but I asked if they could do an alla vodka sauce but on my favourite… Gnocchi!\nSoooo tender, sauce missing pancetta but still very good and grateful I got to eat in my moms honour\n\nOverall, very authentic, great service and food came quick.

Our time there took 3.5 hours.  It took over an hour to get our bills.  We had school aged children and 3 women in their eighties.  They waited, we all waited over an hour for the bill.  We could not understand why.  One waitress said their machine was 30 years old and it would take awhile.  I saw and watched other tables in restaurant get great prompt service.  Their bills came in a timely matter.  They did not wait over an hour for their bill.\nTheir tables were cleared upon finishing their meal. We were blatantly ignored. To top off such a rude experience, the waitress hand wrote a 20% forced gratuity on every bill.  We had no prompt service.  That wasn't offered.  Shady business.  Very clear we were ignored as there was a guaranteed 20% tip from us, no matter what little service we got.  They do not get the 20% guarantee from the smaller tables.

Lynn is a gem and so are her staff that she has handpicked! The food was fantastic and everyone was impressed by the quality and selection. We are a pretty particular bunch when it comes to our meals and not one complaint was had. I would not hesitate to recommend Ban Chok Dee in Maple Ridge to anyone who is looking to book a venue for a special event. The only reason I gave 4 stars for the atmosphere was that it was actually quite hot in the restaurant and the AC wasn't operating in the dining area. Other than that we had no complaints! Lynn now has life long customers from my entire family all because of how she took care of us. Thank you Lynn!!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Time determines food prices – after 3 PM, bowls cost a buck more. Sharing? Nope. And if your bowl hits 700 grams, cue extra charges!

I played it safe, staying probably under 400 grams. Other spots weigh your meal, fair and square. Here? It’s a guessing game: lose out on food or pay extra, no middle ground.\n\nThe food setup's odd too. Sauce at the start? We pour sauce on food, not dunk food in! At 19 CAD (with tax) for a bowl, the price felt steep for what we got. Plus, two bland spring rolls tagged along, probably apologizing for existing. Soggy and off, a first in my Asian eats.\n\nKudos to the front desk girl, trying despite the chaos. But with food and setup off-kilter, staff magic can only do so much.

I enjoy rice over noodles  I didn't want the noodles but when they mentioned that the rice doesn't come in a large bowl  and just on the side, I added noodles. I enjoyed the change, it was a good experience and I'll go back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPqvLCrXJxMX5BLAdArSO7hFm9rXgYPb6Y0F8uH\u0026fid=0x0:0x7608d6d146192205""],""When"":""2023-9-12""}]",

Nonetheless, our lattes were made to perfection. They certainly froth the milk just to the right temperature for the silkiest and sweetest consistency. Wait times are also very reasonable.\n\nWhat we find this place is lacking is more options for baked goods. They have the usual suspect like scones and cookies. Then they have some bowls, wraps, yogurt, etc. In their cold display. But overall, the bite options are somewhat limited.

I called and made reservations for 530 for my family of 5\n\nFood takes a long time to arrive - we complained about how slow it was and the waitress said \""this is a 2 hour seating\"" and that's \""how the kitchen works\"". I could understand if it was fine dining but let's be clear, this is store bought pasta with home made sauces.\n\nMy three boys liked the marinara sauce and the pasta was cooked nicely.\n\nMy wife had the \""special\"" which was roasted chicken (two drum sticks and one thigh) for $29. No mention on the menu that it was only dark meat. She said it was ok and ate most of it but was also very hungry as we had been waiting nearly 1.5hrs for the food to come out.\n\nThe manager?owner?/chef? Went around to every table except ours to check in with customers. We heard him mention it was someone else's birthday and congratulated them - he made no mention to my son about it being his birthday even though it was specified in the reservation (whatever).\n\nThe worst part of the night was when I asked the manager?owner?/chef? About my carbonara sauce. The sauce was cooked improperly - carbonara is supposed to be silky smooth without any curdling of the eggs. My pasta basically had cream, oil and scrambled eggs on it. Apparently this is \""how we do it there\"".  When I explained that this is not what I was expecting and that it wasn't properly made he became very standoffish and rude. I had to ask to have it removed from the bill - which he did but not without his nasty entitled attitude.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, it was clean and cozy. There's not a lot of seating and I guess the only downsides are the very small washrooms (1 person per washroom) and the tables on the right side of the dining room are so close together that my 8 year old could barely fit between the chairs to get to the washroom.\n\nWe thought this would be a nice treat for my son's dinner as we are an Italian family but this was just a letdown on all accounts. Even with my main removed the bill was over $130 (for a glass of house wine, one app- the prawns were tasty, three plates of store bought pasta and my wife's \""special\"").\n\nWon't be back.\n\n***Edit: we ordered two sides of garlic bread and they never brought it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPLi9b1a6K79_tuyWX1dKP-SCvx_AKUQTTU8jjk\u0026fid=0x0:0xe2da073352bb98a3""],""When"":""2024-10-25""},{""Name"":""Monkey Couch"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKjBJae2rKS_uXWCMGu9-Vey95DYSzaWVHAACfGX9Lt21SDIw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Went here the first time with my husband and my friend for her birthday.

The bottom of the crust had separated from the rest of the pizza so, the bottom was well-done and the part that had separated was undercooked. The cheese was so thick and hardened by the time we got it home. I ate two slices because I was hungry (generally food tastes better when you're hungry but not this time) but I threw the rest out.

Pizzas \u0026 chicken wings were Awesome. it was so delicious that after finish it my friend order some food again. everyone enjoyed a lot at that day.

an average tasting Chinese buffet.

The fruits are watermelon and oranges. They have salad and the classic mall type Chinese food items in the buffet. Nothing was outstanding but everything was okay and edible.

Decided to try this place for the first time. The menu online looks great but the experience was not what I expected.\n\nLet me just say that the service was great but that was the only thing that gives this review a 2nd star.\n\nThe Cajun chicken sandwich was a sloppy mess and the chicken breast was paper thin. It looks thick in the photo because they positioned the breast halfway outside the bun to expose the part of it that was curled up but it was maybe half an inch thick at most. The rest it was almost non existent.\n\nThe chicken tenders were literally nothing more than dry, rubbery frozen tenders. There are far better places to get high quality freshly prepared crispy chicken.\n\nOh, and after eating a sandwich and 2 tenders it left a gassy, heavy feeling in my stomach so now I’m laying on my bed on a Sunday afternoon with a bottle of peptol bismol next to me.\n\nWill not be returning. I know food costs are up but I have no desire to waste my money on establishments that raise prices while opting for cheaper ingredients.

Base on the sign, the chickens are locally source. The flavour is very home style. I got a mix of Original and Cajun. The original flavour has a salt and pepper taste. Not something from Churches. While the texture is firm, not overly cooked. Reminds me of free range chicken. The chicken pieces are smaller than Churches.\n\nI'm not a big fan of any French fries nor I eat alot of fish and chips. So I can comment to much on this restaurant. Won't be too fair.

They said “Merry Christmas” and comped us more than $80 in food to say thank you for our loyalty.\n\nThis was amazing. The profit margins are worse in restaurants than almost any other business.

I've been hearing so many raves about this place I had to check it out. I did not enjoy it but I went back a couple months later to give it a second chance. I thought they might have been having an off day since everyone else seems to like it. The second time it was just as bad.\n\n(Feb 2019) My first visit I ordered chow mein, chop suey, almond chicken, sweet and sour pork for take out. The food had zero flavor. It's like they didn't use any sauce, salt, msg, soy sauce or anything at all. The noodles were cooked perfectly. But it was like they cooked them and then did absolutely nothing to them. No sauce, no spice, no flavor. Completely naked bland noodles. So the texture was great. Same with the chop suey. The veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly. They were nice and crispy. But it tasted like boiled broccoli, cauliflower, celery and mini corn. No sauce, no salt, nothing at all added. I've had worse. Some restaurants make their noodles and veggies all soggy and mushy so I appreciate the crispness. But is it common for restaurants to add nothing to these things? Or maybe they did and I just couldn't taste it at all. It just tasted like water. The almond chicken was flavorless. It literally tasted like flour and water. Again no salt or msg or whatever it is that Chinese restaurants usually add to give it that zing of flavor. The quality of meat in the sweet and sour pork was good. Cooked very well again but no flavor again. Is this an msg free restaurant, did they run out of salt, did they forget to add sauce? I've not a fan of salt, I never add it to my food and I often find Chinese food to be heavy on the salty flavor. But I found this food inedible without drowning it in soy sauce which I don't usually do with takeout.\n\n(May 2019) Decided the give this another try, maybe they were having a bad day. Ordered the same thing for takeout plus Char Siu and ginger beef. The veggies and noodles had a bit a flavor this time but nothing special. So that's an improvement there. But the almond chicken was so undercooked. It was soggy and completely white. I'm used to almond chicken being slightly browned (almond colour). I had to pull out my deep fryer to brown and crisp the chicken for my family. The ginger beef was pretty good. I've give it 7/10. The Char Siu sounded amazing on the menu \""slowly oven roasted to perfection\"" but tasted like a chewy, tough pork chop. We ordered enough for 4 people. Usually all the food is gone with Chinese but most of it was left over. No one in the family was really into it.\n\nSo overall good quality meat and veggies but poorly executed. You don't get very much for the price and it seems a little high priced. The staff was nice both times I went in for pick up. Very young though and inexperienced. Several of the girls looked about 15 years old. I think it's great that they are offering students in the community their first jobs. Would I recommend this place? I don't know. I know I'm never going there again because I was not impressed. But the rest of the Chinese restaurants in Maple ridge and Mission are awful with soggy mushy food and gnarly meat. So by default it makes this place \""the best Chinese in town\"". I guess I'd say give it a try and decide for yourself. I'll leave you with this, at least it's not horrible...."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNeFbAAvRIofLTWXtjgDu2doO0v-0Zf3nJALha1\u0026fid=0x0:0x55b3ae1f8ffb622f""],""When"":""2021-4-1""}]",

The cheese to tomato ratio is perfectly sitting at a 1.5:1 allowing the pizza to be gooey, Jim's has a wide variety of dips which just adds to the greatness. The cheese bread is appetizing and great, but I wish it was easier to share. The staff is very polite and really cares about the experience, waitress was friendly, this tops amongst the pizza places I've been to in Vancouver as within the top 10, it might even be top 3 but I would have to try their other pizzas. This is the small pizza and it comfortably feeds 2 people, when I return I'll probably get a larger pizza to take home and test the leftover capabilities. I'll edit this review when I do, for now if you want high end, this is definitely top tier in maple, Coquitlam, Poco and nearing cities given that there is few high quality pizza places. Jim's is unique in that it offers steak and salad as well, but that is a review for another day. Closing remarks is the appetizers for the price could be better shared, but the pizza is very competitively priced and the quality exceeds the price point, great value!

This seems to be an issue with the menu setup on your end, and I kindly request that this be reviewed to improve the ordering experience.\n\nAdditionally, sauces are an essential part of enjoying a pizza, and their absence significantly affects the meal’s quality. If sauces cannot be included with the order, customers may have to resort to buying them separately elsewhere, which detracts from the overall experience.

I asked for a manager and got the assistant who offered 10% off the next order.  I said one of the two pizzas I paid for is not going to be eaten so how is 10% fair?  After a bit she offered 20%.  I told her that was hardly fair either.  She asked to call me back in 5 minutes which she did and said that she could give 50% off the next order.

The park is also home to a diverse range of plant and animal life, making it a perfect place to connect with nature."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM7QR63o4deDIO1g5QLjtqYeJVEVL_itU2IkK8y\u0026fid=0x0:0x53c9dd48c2d2eae8""],""When"":""2024-7-12""},{""Name"":""Nihit Malhotra"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXfeHWYeDGkDTZNd33AgDsCmLoJ4NSwzG1vpopgAV9OU-hgspcS7Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Peaceful Park with Scenic Trails\n\nKanaka Creek Regional Park is a lovely spot with some good trails, perfect for a peaceful day outdoors. Parking is a bit limited, so plan accordingly. It's a great place for picnics, with plenty of spots to sit beside the flowing creek and take in the serene surroundings. The trail to the falls is only about a kilometer, but honestly, the falls themselves aren't particularly impressive—if you're coming just for the falls, it might not be worth the trip.\n\nThat said, the trail along the creek is definitely worth the walk. It has some steep inclines, so it's not stroller-friendly, but the scenery more than makes up for it. You can easily spend a few hours here, enjoying the quiet, sitting by the water, or even dipping your feet in the creek.

The prices seem high at first, but once you have the first bite you can see why.

Two of which were family members from out of town that we recommended this spot to, because usually it’s good.\nHowever, this trip left us feeling disappointed.\nUpon entering the restaurant, there was no hostess around so we waited for about 10 minutes until someone noticed and we got seated. We were given menus but not approached by our waitress for another 10 minutes. We kept it simple— ice waters, a coffee, a juice and a hot chocolate without whipped cream. Again, we waited an additional 10 minutes, before the waitress came back missing a majority of the order. The waters were missing and the hot chocolate contained whipped cream— which was asked not to be put on. The waitress instead of simply saying I made a mistake, just proceeded to say we spoke incorrectly and she was just following what was asked.\n\nAnother few minutes, waters came out and so did the next hot chocolate, by a different waitress. The hot chocolate was terrible— hardly any actual chocolate in it and mostly lukewarm water. Had to flag down our waitress who seemed to be avoiding our table, and again didn’t address the mistake, just proceeded to call it ‘odd’. So, gave up on that beverage and ordered another different one.\n\nFood came out and was decent— though not worth the price. The bacon was poorly cooked and hardly edible, the potatoes were bland, and the coffee wasn’t great.\n\nAll in all, the lesson learned from this would be to pay more attention to your customers, specially when an allergen is mentioned, and apologize for any mistakes made instead of making it a big deal.\n\nWould think twice about coming back to this particular DeDutch. 😕"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""N nova"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKVwkmAucI_zKw-myeb5xINxQiGjdUygLuG8oftGwvM-DLxuQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""The pancake (pancake comes with sausage, bacon, eggs, ham, and hash browns).

address prices. It's getting out of control how expensive it's becoming to go put to eat, \u0026 have a treat, not just just at Dairy Queen!\n\nA mini blizzard, which is by the way micro mini size of inside of small palm is $6 \u0026 almost $7.5 for small, which is still very small. Photos are added so u can get a price example. It's just getting out of hand.\n\nAlthough this location is 1st location I've been to in a while that's listened to me asking for extra pickles, there was little condiments on our burgers, which made them dry. I had to ask for more mustard \u0026 used ketchup packages.\n\nNow let's move on to the Blizzard. This is what was most disappointing. $6 for this little tiny thing \u0026 she didn't hang it upside down when she brought it to me (I didn't know they were supposed to do) cuz I've never purchased blizzard before.  After she gave to me I walked to car \u0026 picked up spoon \u0026 was like wait a minute, this is milkshake texture so I went back inside asking her \u0026 her response \""When I gave it to u it was thick\""\n\nI'm pretty sure that only took maybe 3 min from time she gave it to me till time I walk back in with it. Hardly not enough time for it to go from blizzard thickness to liquid that was running off spoon. I asked her to remake it, she was not very happy about that. The 2nd one she gave me was better, not thick, but better...at least it didn't fall out of cup when she hung it upside down 2nd time LOL\n\nI got the new flavor Oreo chocolate brownie \u0026 it did not taste like chocolate at all, there was no brownies in it at all. Maybe it was just this location, I don't know. Wasn't very happy with it at all.\n\nMoving along to cakes.... wow wow wow. Inflation sure has shown in the prices of these ice cream cakes. Almost $60 for most of them with tax,  gross!!\n\nStick with the value meal that includes a 🍨 much better buck"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPHbvEsyOjl7xT-tYl9diDKmB1rykUbXMgfTjTz\u0026fid=0x0:0xe9d93214f425f79a""],""When"":""2023-8-14""},{""Name"":""Adolfo Garcia"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXk76S2kbhMbdiRSvTJO85jQ-iHosG75dMnnm-bv3ncX6tkFuc=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Unacceptable Customer Service\n\nI had an extremely disappointing experience with this Dairy Queen location.

I always order this exact same meal and it's 13 dollars with the upgrade.  The staff said oh we don't do that you have to pay for the blizzard separately.  I said you're the only dairy queen around that does this... you can cancel that whole order then.  I then proceeded to the other dairy queen in town and low and behold I only paid 13 dollars.... management really needs to train their staff better.

The worst part is that it was my birthday and I was looking forward to a treat. Bad customer service or at least poorly trained staff. Will not eat there again.  The salads also leave a lot to be desired. Wendy’s salads are better for about the same price or less.

to this part of city by fluke, and tried this place without looking at reviews during a power outage!

The soup was proper rich and real broth and just so delicious. So good we had to pack the last bit home, didn’t want to waste a single drop!\nWe also ordered the wings and chicken fried spring rolls (awesome they had non-pork option!).

But the rest of them are incredibly inept.\n\nOne guy who has been to my building MULTIPLE times still can’t operate the buzzer. Another can’t seem to figure out how to open the door when the thing buzzes. They barely speak, and have no customer service skills.\n\nToday the guy brings me pizza and his debit machine battery is so low that the machine won’t process the payment. So he leaves and days he’ll be right back to collect payment. He has to go get a new machine. Two hours later I had to call the store to find out what’s happening. I can’t wait all night for a guy who can’t figure out how to do the basics of delivering pizza to decide to come back to get the money.\n\nThe person who answers the phone hands it to the delivery guy who gets on the phone AND DOESN’T TALK. After about 30 seconds he says, “I’m the delivery guy”. I asked him when he was coming back because I can’t sit here and wait all night, and he said “oh, I’ll come right now.” HE WASN’T EVEN PLANNING ON COMING AT THAT TIME! He totally did not care how long I was waiting for him. Like a complete narcissist, he just figured he’d show up sometime before midnight when he felt like it?!!!! I mean seriously. I told him if he wasn’t here in 30 min he could forget about it because I won’t be home.\n\nSo now he says he’s on his way.\n\nI then talked to the manager. I told him what happened and he couldn’t even manage a simple conversation. He barely said a word and had no idea what to do or what to say. And that’s when I realized this Pizza Hut is staffed by the people who can’t hold a job anywhere else and that no one from management down cares about anything at all. They’re just insipid space fillers… if I owned this Pizza Hut I would close it down because clearly the owner also doesn’t care about his business.\n\nOne competent delivery guy. I order from here once a week and the only thing that’s more frustrating than their garbage service is the fact I have kept doing business with them for the past year+.\n\nNo more.

She has been talking about it since so we decided to order there tonight as there aren't many local options that will accommodate her.\n\nI spoke to the PAC person and she told me the ginger garlic sauce was gluten free and showed the email from the manager confirming this. I went on the website to order but this sauce doesn't exist in the build your own bowl so I called. During the call, I told the person who answered about our school and gluten free and she confirmed the ginger garlic sauce was the one. I said I would call back with the rest of our order.\n\nLess then 5 minutes later I called back and I said \""okay I will get one of those ginger garlic with chicken and rice\"" then I ordered the rest of our meals. She said ok, it would be ready in 25-30 min. I told her my name and said my husband would be picking up and gave her name. This was not a rushed conversation. She had lots of time to clarify anything.\n\nSo my husband went in time to pick it up. He forgot his phone at home. I noticed it was taking super long to come back. When he finally arrived he told me that when he went to pick it up, the lady told him that she knows I wanted gluten free but nothing I ordered was gluten free. He said that was weird but paid anyway and left. He then had to go to a different restaurant to pick up something else for my daughter, spending more money and taking more time.\n\nWhen he got home and told me, I called back and was told I ordered a different dish. I said if that was the case, and you knew I was ordering gluten free since I just spoke to her and I told them it was me asking about the gluten free, why did she not confirm with me at the moment of ordering instead of waiting for when my husband went to pick up? Even if he had confirmed that was wrong, he would have had to wait for them to remake the dish. It would have made much more sense for everyone if she just confirmed when I ordered instead of not saying anything, especially since I kept saying gluten free. I am not the expert of their menu, they are.\n\nShe kept essentially blaming my husband and kept condescendingly saying \""I understand\"" (sounded like this was their training, because it was clear she did not understand). She offered no solutions so I ended the call. She called back and I chose not to answer. In the voicemail, she said she would make it no extra charge and we can go pick it up. But this isn't really a solution since 1. We already paid for the one they made that wasn't gluten free 2. I already spent extra having to get an alternate meal for her 3. It would have taken even more of my time to wait for it to be made and then drive back. Personally, I think they should have offered a refund or a coupon for the cost of the meal at the very be least.\n\nAs for the meal we got, those of us could eat it felt it was all just okay. Good value for money. It's a big serving. Had the customer service been good we would have tried again as it is good value for money.\n\nBad customer service combined with just okay food means we won't be repeat customers."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Erik Ostensen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKQpXi3wqlUgDP12KMcq1OauP6eTj3rkSzpWb3LA9l6F_pUCw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I work in the area and go here for lunch very often.

our half cooked pizza we got today. I hope someone contacts me.\n\nWe order from here quite often, and usually the food is okay, but today was awful. I placed my order online, when I got there the young guy working ignored me until his coworker arrived, then told me he would be a minute. I got my pepperoni deep dish pizza and brought it home.\n\nWhen we started eating it, it tasted funny and had weird texture. I pulled the toppings off and the dough was only half cooked. It was so under cooked the dough was stringy just under the toppings. By then it was too late to drive back into town and complain in person. So I sent in feedback online and decided to post here.

I now have to drive to the other end of town or across the bridge for late night food.\n\nI just want my go to place after work to be back to normal. After tonight, quite let down.\n\nWell normally you see a 24 establishment maybe go down for a little bit to clean but when you close at 12:30 and not open till 4am, that is misleading. Especially on the weekend. Not very happy about this."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTH5-xrgUslYykTFcZBEnG2DCuL5RowGWC09O-\u0026fid=0x0:0x89d0f9cb00350f81""],""When"":""2022-6-19""},{""Name"":""Cassandra Tracy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU-5vKwbJUrgf_pbtU6AtIeiIYyxP3V5bWP29S8mvlOhJ7QUfRn=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""I placed a mobile order for the pick up kerbside hoping it would be faster than the drive-through.

Coachman for the first time. I had an overall enjoyable experience and I highly recommend this local gem!\n\n•VIBES/ATMOSPHERE\nThe atmosphere was laid back and the place has a fantastic old school pub feel (which is exactly the way I like a pub to be). They also have a lovely patio with some misty water spray to keep you cool in the summer. I didn’t sit on the patio, but it sure looked nice.\n\n•SERVICE\nThe service was excellent. The waitress (the very tattooed young Asian lady) was fantastic. She was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, super fast, and made me feel welcomed and comfortable. She checked on me the exact correct number of times (I get annoyed by waitresses who repeatedly pester, this one had good instincts and was on point). My order was taken immediately and my drink/food arrived fast. As a smoker who has no incentive to aimlessly hover in/around a pub with no smoking areas, speed of service is very important to me.\n\n•DRINKS\nThey have a pretty extensive drink menu with lots of choices. The variety of cocktail choices impressed me as a cocktail drinker. I ordered the Blue Hawaiian. While it was more teal-green than blue and not as sweet as my sweet tooth alcohol taste desires, you couldn’t taste the alcohol but could feel it. And that is everything a successful cocktail should be. I will definitely have to be back to try more of their summer cocktails (and ask for them to be extra sweet!)\n\n•FOOD\nI noticed other people eating burgers and being the nosy follower that I sometimes can be, I thought I’d go for the burger special. But when the waitress said the burger is a regular burger, I decided to order the calamari instead (my burgers need to be irregular otherwise I’m bored, there’s a limit to my sheepish follower behaviour after all). The calamari was delicious! It was warm, fresh, crispy, flavourful and a large portion. The tomato \u0026 green onion salsa that came with it was sour and salty; tasty and refreshing. The sauce was also delicious, although if you dip every calamari piece, you will run out of sauce on your last 3 pieces. I recommend they add a tiny bit more sauce to ensure that all calamaris are successfully dipped. This calamari was the crispiest calamari I’ve ever had in my life, which was a pleasant surprise. Even the squeezed juice from my lemon and the tomato pieces didn’t and couldn’t make this calamari soggy. I bet you could pour buckets of water on this calamari and it wont lose its crunch. A waterproof non-soggy calamari. It seems I have searched my entire life for such a thing. And now I’ve finally found it!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOH4AERpkElu4yTZKq9vFJ3c1y1W2XvEbIAHOyN\u0026fid=0x0:0xd08aec90d2675cc2""],""When"":""2024-7-29""},{""Name"":""Christopher Adams"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXcL5bNZ-lkkKT4gy1k5l3D2BvEp2MJobsZwK2jpBW_3saF1nbleg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Great place, really good food and service, plenty of options to eat and drink.

The second waitress who took over was regrettably rude and unprofessional. Despite her assurance to refill our water twice, she never returned with it. Although we ordered promptly, we waited 35 minutes without any food. When we finally flagged down the waitress, she explained that there had been a mix-up as she assumed we had finished our meal. When our food finally arrived, it was a mixed experience. My wife's gnocchi was good, but my fish and chips were disappointing; the fish was undercooked and frozen, making it impossible to cut.

The amount of dressing perfect.\n\nThe salmon burger was good and came with nicely seasoned fries.\n\nOverall it was a good dining experience and we would dine there again."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN7UT8AOPYwRxdwCdsDZmRvHv55kTZyEaHmJeAU\u0026fid=0x0:0xfe43abe99f45cdb9""],""When"":""2024-7-1""}]",

It also comes with strawberry sauce and butter syrup for more sweetness.\n\nThe best thing to have there are the milkshakes, which they come in a variety of flavours. You can even have two flavours in the milkshake if you want. When I asked if they could make an Eggnog Milkshake, they were courteous enough to go through the trouble.\n\nThe interior look of the establishment looks nice with their 50s theme they have going.\n\nOverall, Rocko's Diner is a decent restaurant with some creative entrees to offer and would not mind coming back there."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMhfXmvacwQRLglkvW6jKEPGT6LsGKhZbJkcc0a\u0026fid=0x0:0x7685afc730c4d19e""],""When"":""2024-12-8""},{""Name"":""param parkash"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX4GjTwUYwzDq_M1KDsLxtYNUaLlLQSsnVHDF3ZC-Xyz-4wozxNZQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The drive to this place from Vancouver is fun and the food is also good.

They have signs that say “abusive behavior is not tolerated,” yet their servers are apparently allowed to mistreat customers without consequence.\n\nI usually don’t complain, but one server, who appeared to be of Asian descent, treated us quite poorly. After I asked a simple question, she responded with something like, “I hear what you said; you’ve already said it too many times.” Her tone was dismissive and rude.\n\nI’m not someone who expects perfection, but basic respect should be a given in any service interaction.

Happy smiling staff who are helpful and knowledgeable.\n\n•The Shop 5/5: endless items - pottery, berry infused coffee and tea, pickled veggies, jams, syrups. The handmade Blueberry Honey soap is my favorite.\n\n•The Bakery 4.75/5: scrumptious treats and baked goods.\n-Pie In A Jar 5/5: loaded with fresh fruit, strawberry glaze, custard that’s not too sweet, crust that’s not too heavy, must try!\n-Cinnamon Buns 4/5: I’m not normally a cinnamon bun fan, but theirs changed me; however, the last two times I’ve had them they’ve been on the dry side.\n-Shortcakes 4/5: light dough and sugar, loaded with seasonal fruit. My favorite was Apple Shortcake in 2023.\n-Popcorn 5/5: Caramel Corn.\n-Baked Pies 3.5/5: nothing against their pies, but when at Krause, I prefer a unique treat.\n-Waffle Bar 4/5: light, fluffy, heaping with fresh fruit, syrup, and whipped cream (Blueberry’s #1). My vegan friends gave vegan/GF waffles 4/5.\n\n•The Porch 2/5: great service, but not quick service. Went on a Monday at 2:30pm, no line, one slice of pizza + fries took over 15mins. Two weeks later, it was a busy day, took 20+mins for my friend to get a slice of pizza. Bottom line, prepare for a long wait.\n-Roasted Corn Pizza 3/5: $8.50 per slice is steep, but portions were generous. Loaded with corn, cheese, a little artichoke. Crust was tough, but I think it’s gluten-free, which is a texture I’m not used to.\n-Farm Fries 5/5: piping hot, shareable with 3-4 people (two of us ate half). I wish they sold half-sizes.\n-Blueberry Milkshake 1/5: in Krause’s defense, I should’ve taken it back, I’d like to think they would’ve made it right; however, I had to get home and didn’t sip it until I drove away. For $9, I expected greatness, what I got was a liquidy mildly flavored blueberry milk. It wasn’t cold or thick like any shake I’ve had, and overpriced for the size. The shake took over 10mins. The Porch issues are unlike anything I’ve experienced at Krause, hopefully it improves.\n\nKrause Farm is fun for many reasons, do yourself a favor and check it out!\n\nP.S. in the off season, be careful of potholes!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMCKqMhQFVsM5nLO-2waK1vD8tZ0Yr85rA1lDUm\u0026fid=0x0:0xfe96a7a5520a4232""],""When"":""2024-8-9""},{""Name"":""Ramin Mohammaddoust"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJDCbSRb6vq4cTA5D-g_tlXR8PAr89iMl3ZB2Z6TYcmHQ44kw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""A pristine and beautiful location, the perfect place to relax during the week!

Now known as Five Forks, I came for dinner and had an excellent experience eating there. The waitress was very nice and showed great gaiety in serving me. I order the Lobster Mac \u0026 Cheese, which was their chef's special and their Blue Hawaiian cocktail. The Blue Hawaiian was very good and can taste the Malibu Rum and Blue Curacao in it. The mac and cheese exceeded my taste buds in how good it was. The entree has a nice gooey consistence from the cheese was baked, while the alfredo sauce was so flavoursome, and they make the sauce from scratch too. Despite the name, you are given one lobster tail for the mac and cheese, however the lobster was still great, especially when it is paired with the macaroni and cheese. It came with garlic toast too that I enjoyed. When I came there again, I ordered from their Brunch menu. I ordered their Forks Breakfast Bowl with coffee. Then entree tasted great overall; the rice tasted excellent, especially when paired with the hollandaise and salsa sauces. The coffee was good, not the best though. The interior design of the restaurant looks very high-class and clean as well. Because this is a large restaurant, there are different sections for you to dine at and the waiter would ask where you like to sit at. But I still recommend anyone to come and eat there during anytime of the day."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPJGhsUhQgTW7DbxupBbeswsoWrPddWCQliqPGr\u0026fid=0x0:0x71380e83264b3d4d""],""When"":""2024-8-11""},{""Name"":""Rayanne Boehm"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW7nXtx0vS86bw2PHY_udvCXyxr6MAucicGyxiWuXoTRwurJXG0=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The husband and I enjoyed our time here.

There was a buttermilk chicken option that would have tasted better with the sauce and toppings. All in all it was good. The kids menu was 14.95 and doesn't include a drink or dessert/ice cream. The burger was a good size but after a drink its $18. Most kids menus have that included and I think it would be a smart move. Their burger buns were ok but I'd love to drop a pack of my homemade buns off for them to give a try 🤣. This place has a lot of potential.

NO, u are incorrect.  Piper, if that is who's taking responsibility, did not have a note pad when she took our orders.  In fact, I even mentioned, \""Are u sure u can remember everyone's orders, \u0026 another waitress was also assisting.  Neither wrote anything down at our table, otherwise why would she need to come back to our table 3X to say \""I'm sorry, but what did u order, or your meal comes with, sry forget to ask u, here are your choices\""  There were several other things, I did not mention in review, because telling potential customers our waitress had to be asked 2x for our granddaughters chocolate milk, \u0026 forgotten strawberries \u0026 whip cream, toast ...I felt could be left out, but since excues are being made by u, I will include this in my edit.\n\nAlso, admitting that your staff overcharged us gratuity \u0026 not doing the right thing to rectify that is great for business, I bet, in addition to staff not being properly trained on that end of things.  Not to mention, staff telling potential customers wanting the buffet, who were wanting to make Mother's day reservations that YES your restaurant WAS doing Mother's day buffet \u0026 it was never the plan....terrible!  We chatted with several others waiting in line who were also told the same thing, only to arrive to no buffet, some even leaving when they found out...so your staff clearly dropped the ball.   We spent well over $200 at your establishment that day \u0026 all u do is defend staff mistakes, lie about what really happened, not offer any form of rectification for the  overcharge which could technically be classifiedas theft \u0026 fraud! Then u say u look forward to serving us again? 😉 We will not ever come back to this restaurant. Unethical behavior by management 100% that should be reported, which my husband will likely be addressing!   I hope those who read this review make sure if they do go to your restaurant, that they carefully look over their bill BEFORE paying, so they too don't get their hard earned $ taken, so it can go into your employees pockets.  I can't even imagine how many other tables Piper has done this too...terrible Honest mistake? Then management should offer the customer nothing less than :let us make it right:...end of story.  That is ethical \u0026 professional customer service, not how u handled things.  I am now changing my * to 1\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED today.  We called last week \u0026 asked if they would be doing Mother's Day buffet \u0026 were told \""Yes,\"" so we reserved a table for 8.  6 adults, 2 children.\n\nOnly to discover once arriving, they did NOT have a buffet at all.  We should have left right then, but obviously at that point with everyone being hungry \u0026 most other places likely booked, we stayed.  Waitress was ok, \u0026 she chose not to write our orders down, so she had to come back several times to  ask what we ordered again, forgetting several items as well. A few people at the table had issues with their meals. (not enough to complain)  I asked for no powdered sugar on my bread, but it was on it.  At the end of our meals, waitress brought our 5 separate bills.  At that time, we were slammed with the reality that there was an automatic 15% gratuity added to each of our individual bills.\n\nThat angered several people at our table.  #1. Tipping should not be forced upon anyone.  A tip is earned by hard work.  A tip is a customer's way of expressing appreciation for the effort the staff made to please you.  An expectation, absolutely, but certainly not mandatory.  So, to force that upon a customer is rude.  Also, some of our guests were single \u0026 still forced to pay the 15% gratuity without feeling they received a proper meal or service, not to mention, unaware of other guests also coming, so that upset them.\n\n2. Our table should have been told this BEFORE ordering, not once she brought our bills to the table.  That is what upset me.\n\nI'm always a generous tipper, but I would agree, I don't like feeling as though I'm being forced to tip.  It's not right, especially if the staff did not earn it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPUz3TLYF_mEDcDWrm8fSmvb6RPHxvd1yox9iPN\u0026fid=0x0:0xfe5ec2724c2b37ac""],""When"":""2024-5-13""},{""Name"":""Andreas Weigl"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWesY7_o3e4JvTgrlkRe_dgu8tLW-XkKJYNq6H25z2Q0EPwOb1t=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It's one of my favourite restaurants.

Location isn't super obvious and feels tucked away. Neighbours to a tattoo parlour. Kid's menu is top notch, and my boys loved the grilled cheese and burger. Crayons were fresh, good colour variety, and choice of activities or colouring for entertainment while food was being prepared. I split the mini sampler with my partner to experience as many options as possible. Hot wings were that slow burn, sweet sauce. Hotter than Frank's red hot sauce, not too hot for me. I recommend choosing the dark chicken option, the white breast was on the dry side, but good paired with the pulled pork or extra sauce from the wings or baked beans. Ribs are fall off the bone and easy to split with a butter knife. The beef brisket was a little disappointing - served in too much water. Would have been better on the grilled bun with beans. Pulled pork was the star, I recommend anything with it. Oh, and the mixed green salad was a great light side with lots of dried fruit. Lots of leftovers to take home!

If you are looking to have your bbq meats smoked, then you will be disappointed...especially with the Brisket which is braised and served in a very thin liquid meant to be au jus (lacks flavor).

They meat falls off the bone nicely and the bbq sauce is tasty. The chicken lacks smoke and tastes like regular rotisserie chicken.\nThe overall presentation of the platter is good and there is a lot of food.The wings were good with a nice honey garlic flavor. The caesar salad is fresh and delicious and the fries and bread were very nice. Fat wedges and generous buttery portions respectively.\nThe service is attentive and friendly. The dill potato salad is excellent! But speaks to how everything is nontraditional.

Chinese food. Our usual place was closed on Monday so we gave this one a try. The prices were much lower than other places. We were looking for a bargain but now we see you get what you pay for.\n\nThe food tasted like curry. I don't know if it's intentionally added. Is this a fusion restaurant? Or is it cross-contamination? I like Curry but not in my Chinese food. It was a real turn off. Some of my family members refuse to eat it because of this.\n\nThe Chow Mein noodles are not edible. They were so soggy. No one liked them. Really gummy.  And they were cut into 2 inch pieces. Who does this. I like long proper noodles. I don't like having it cut up like it's for a baby.\n\nAlmond chicken was ok but nothing special.\n\nHoney garlic pork was good.\n\nBBQ pork fried rice had gnarly bits of fat instead of meat. The bits weren't edible. It was nasty. This dish also had heavy Indian seasoning. Again, not sure if this was intentional or if they don't wash their dishes well and there is some cross-contamination. My family hated the rice.\n\nBeef chop suey. Very gnarly meat.

here today and I will for sure be back! To start - I don't prefer alcohol beverages but hubby loves his beer and breweries.\n\nThe bartender was great. He greeted when we walked in. They seemed a bit short with I believe one server. She was okay but could have been a bit more friendly (was not rude just could have upped her energy a little). The basics were done - checked in on us made sure we weren't waiting on anything else.\n\nSo! Hubby ordered the Sunday special which was a pint of beer and the soft pretzel with dip of choice. He asked for the Light Speed Pale Ale which he mentioned was quite nice.\nWe shared the pretzel and requested queso as the dip. 10/10 best soft pretzel and queso we have tried at a brewery by far. There were also a couple pieces of cut up dill pickle to dip. Amazing.\n\nNow.. I'm a bit different. I knew I was getting a craft soda but I was hoping for a miracle drink that I was ready to make myself. On their dessert menu is ice cream and within their beverage menu is the Phillips root beer. You know where I'm going this. Their bartender made it happen for me. I sat at our table sipping my root beer alcohol free drink happier than I have ever been at a brewery.\n\nTo end our drinks we shared The Dutton hot dog. Now the dog itself is fairly basic but the toppings help quite a bit! Toppings were quite yummy and the banana peppers didn't have the heat I was anticipating but it was quite a nice mix of ingredients.\n\nWe will be back for sure. Hopefully for another root beer float if they're up for it but doo wanna try their other hot dogs. I may test a few beers if I'm feeling adventurous.\n\nAtmosphere is darker side / was a bit warm inside. But seemed very fun with some couches set up and there's also board games on shelving between couch set up's (there's 2 sets of couches / tables for games etc)\n\nAlso in the ladies washroom the stall beside the sink is very very open with a gap between the door and wall... Just something to be mindful about."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMDFjzi8iNf4aLYaahujvuQ6eAwUQBjcWHyxH3I\u0026fid=0x0:0x35c03053a20596b2""],""When"":""2024-6-23""},{""Name"":""Sophie Gray"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL36Qb7H0T0AWP0NY24K80_D5qPIl_SZUJgkywhO5EqMMBuSQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""5 stars all around.

The bowl itself tasted entirely of sweet sugary sauce.i could have achieved this same flavour with rice, sauce and chicken  at home . Got the bill and was still charged for the drink so I asked and got it fixed. I should have just said I had a intolerance to sugar at the beginning and the meal would have been made to fit my needs and I regret that .

choking hazard. See below.\n\nNot too happy with this location for many reasons. To start, I placed an online order for mac and  cheese and it said 45 mins. Seriously? Okay, so I guess I'll have to wait. After 15 mins I went in, the place was empty and my food was sitting on the counter. If there is no wait why does the app say 45 mins? My food would've just sat there getting cold for another 30 mins.\n\nMy level 3 spice was non-existant. It says level one has a mild dose of heat. Level two is for hot lovers only. I ordered number three and tasted no spice whatsoever.\n\nThere were no onions and no red peppers in the order as advertised. I didn't see or taste any cilantro that was supposed to be included according to the menu. And I wasn't a fan of the whole cherry tomatoes tossed in instead of the diced tomatoes shown in the photo.\n\nIt's an extra $5 for meat which is ridiculous considering it's already almost 20 bucks for mac and cheese and the quantity of meat they add is tiny. The char siu add-on was disgusting and gnarly. It was like chewing gum.\n\nThe food didn't taste nearly as good as other noodle box locations. Hardly any sauce and really lacking in flavor.\n\nAnother thing that really bothered me is when I went to pull off the plastic lid it was so brittle it cracked into pieces that fell into my food leaving clear sharp jagged plastic bits in my food. How poor is the quality of their supplies that you can't even pull off a lid without it crumbling into pieces? I wasn't rough with it. And it happened the first time it was pulled off. It must've been really old or exposed to heat or sunlight to be so fragile.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, I thought this place was fairly new. Why does it feel like a dank, dirty pub from the 80s?"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMPjRH-HHPbJ3zfhRfPdIjpfTovlYcy20y66uij\u0026fid=0x0:0x91ad6a7f3bd089a4""],""When"":""2024-11-3""},{""Name"":""Brandon Stewart"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLkm3BRUVR43kzVWblXsgFPHcgenlpMHz_VwRsy957NDVfdYw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""If I could give zero stars I would.\nDisgusting place.\nThis restaurant has screwed me around multiple times.\nThis time they served me moldy noodles, every noodle in my bowl was littered in mold, and when I brought the food back to show them all gave me was a free order and 15% off..\nThe shift manager was no help as she tried to deny these allegations even though the mold was right infront of her face.\nI’d like the owner to contact me or food safe will be getting involved."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOPxXJ07_DJLj_l8o9ntZkhN6L_RQ2UEie-YVxN\u0026fid=0x0:0x91ad6a7f3bd089a4""],""When"":""2024-11-6""},{""Name"":""Xanaphia Xangel"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU_seHMrjSrnxKKFO83cfvdunybCw5ja6M_3nSpcSL1-33Wfq-r=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Staff is great, they make suggestions, they listen to your order attentively.

Decided to try the Thai style chow mein with crispy tofu… unfortunately it has almost zero flavour, very slight hint of curry. The noodles are super dry, the veggies seem like they’ve been sitting around all day. The tofu is the opposite of crispy, it’s dry, soggy, chewy. We live 5 min max away and it wasn’t sitting long enough to turn into this. I know, because my bf’s dish was fine, everything in his bowl seemed fresh. I was looking forward to not leaving the house this Sunday but with the cost of food, I can’t justify not going back and getting my moneys worth of something possibly more edible than this. It looks a lot better than it tastes..\n\n*Editing and adding a couple stars, I brought the food back and they remade my bowl with a different option at no charge, which I greatly appreciate. However, they mentioned they would never recommend the chow mein dish as they agree it’s flavourless and not very good. They also said there was an issue with the deep fryer. My suggestion to avoid future disappointed customers would be to ask if they’ve had it before.. and suggest a different option if they’ve never had it. Secondly, if the deep fryer isn’t working, it would be better to advise the customer to choose a different protein or suggest plain tofu instead of crispy. You can’t help if there’s crappy dishes on the menu and it’s a chain so you may not be able to remove it, but there’s ways around it by offering different options to avoid disappointment."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMU-DAWYGACiZHsE_xdjg630rLFkHxZHLXaIcp1\u0026fid=0x0:0x91ad6a7f3bd089a4""],""When"":""2024-1-22""},{""Name"":""Cody C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUuV9gG_hr6FBp8SeUw9lQQ2-zPDVWRtVgiikbv3uRsyAA7dmim=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Worst Noodlebox around.

Our 2 lamb dinners came to 20$ more than listed. When I brought this to their attention I was told they couldn't change the website. Eventually they gave me 2 pieces of custard, but wouldn't give the food at the listed price or even a discount. When I suggested they warn people that call to order that the prices aren't as listed,  or give them a total over the phone I was told they have to add it up with a calculator and got a shrug and a sorry. I feel bad for the server at the til.\nThe food is alright, but when you're expecting to pay 50$ for take out and are charged $70 it really takes away from the experience."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Krista Hole"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVEXo3-V2CjTOG6XSOVVMNxDnqpckLkrnmAdZ_E77liLbluTz-d=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food was fantastic, service was wonderful.
