Being built in 2016/2017, OC's dinning hall has a main seating area and another room for additional guests.\n\nThe atmosphere is really spacious and the architecture allows for great  natural sunlight. The seating there can sit 200-300 people. At regular meal time, 8am -9am, 11am to 12pm, 6pm to 7pm, expect there to be lots of people.\n\nThe food there is okay and there is variety there every day. The portion is small (all-you can eat, but you get pre-allocated portions) so you can get multiple kinds of food. Sometimes, the food is too saulty or the tasting is off. The dinning hall is open from 7am to 10pm every day, but the food may not be plentiful or have great variety when you come to eat outside of regular meal hours.\n\nThe pricing is cheapest around breakfast at around $12. Lunch is $16 and dinner is at $20. The food is all you can eat. If you have a UBC meal plan, then you can go to OC as many times as you want and are unlimited in entries. If you have residence meal plan, then the cost would not matter to you. You are not charged per entry, but charged for the entire meal plan as a whole.\n\nFor food options there, you can expect salad bar, yogurt ball, vegetarian options for food, stir-fry grill, and burger grill. There are fresh fruits like apple, bananas, oranges and plum. There is tea, coffee and juice available. Their Philly cheesesteak sandwich and burgers is good.\n\nTo know the menu of OC, you can download an app to see their menus. Their lunch and dinner menus are the same."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP0aPX-vNdBTU_jqkiXOSgJRpgqyUEHS9HhAyML\u0026fid=0x0:0xd0113f8377d90e0c""],""When"":""2023-9-13""},{""Name"":""yoyo huang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVHfL3bnaoL_4LM9Q6GkGocV7c7Sko1louBNBsuDc0OrdaDTJLa=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""The food here is very unstable, sometimes good, sometimes bad.

Curiston pulled out her phone and recorded the encounter, which ended when a kitchen worker grabbed the rat with a pair of tongs. The critter fell to the floor, and the worker carried on with his duties.\nDinner service continued, but UBC told CTV News the grill station was immediately closed down and sanitized, and all the food was thrown out.\n“(We) are working actively with our pest control partner to address the situation,\"" said Colin Moore, director of UBC Food Services, in a statement to CTV News. \""All employees have been informed and reminded about proper sanitation measures as necessary,”\nUBC also confirmed Vancouver Coastal Health has since inspected the cafeteria, finding no evidence of rodent infestation and saying it’s content with the school’s sanitation and pest control measures.\nStudents living in several residences at UBC pay for a meal plan, which gives them credit to buy meals at school cafeterias and restaurants. Curiston wants UBC to consider giving students some form of a reimbursement or meal voucher, saying despite health inspectors signing off on the cafeteria’s cleanliness, the image of a rat in the kitchen will keep her from dining there for some time.\n“I refuse to go back until I know for a fact they’ve dealt with the rat problem,” she said. “If they set out traps, I’d feel more safe eating there.”​"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNdu1L40XRvbU__oyjBuTwVZOpwceqlwIHYwesg\u0026fid=0x0:0xd0113f8377d90e0c""],""When"":""2022-1-20""}]",

It's not always predictable, but I've found that to hit the quieter days that I prefer, early evening during exam season at school is best, and summer in general are chiller than the main academic year.\nThe food is good, often surprisingly good. The menu items are well thought-out and tasty, and nicely presented. It's not a veg-centric establishment but there's lots of choice for vegans! Off the current menu, I've had the Power Punch Salad, the Vegan Pulled Jackfruit, the Vegan Burger, Vegan Chick'n Caesar Wrap, and the Tempeh Teriyaki. I wasn't particularly impressed by the Caesar wrap - it wasn't awful, I just didn't feel like it was worth $19.5, but everything else was a delight. I'm glad their vegan burger is a (seemingly) housemade, minimally processed black bean patty instead of beyond meat or similar! I usually won't order a salad as my meal, but the Power Punch is substantial! The side salad that comes with the sandwich orders is actually pretty nice too.\nThey make good cocktails and have a long list of local draft beers on tap which I haven't really had a chance to dip into, but I got the \""Green Bird\"" for fun on St. Patrick's Day, which is just a version of their house \""T-Bird\"" lager that's been coloured green (maybe naturally, judging by the grassy notes I got from it, but I don't know for sure). It was actually a good lager though!\nSometimes the staff is nice enough, sometimes I get the vibe that they're too cool to be serving me or something, but because the only interactions you have with them are when you order and pay at the bar and when they bring your food out, an unenthusiastic bartender doesn't ruin the whole experience. Because of this service style, you can expect to be in and out of here faster than you would at a full table service restaurant, but it's not fast food, so dishes still take as much time to prep as they would at a \""regular\"" sit-down place. It's also pricier than typical counter service food, but very reasonably priced compared to off-campus restaurants that serve food of this quality, and there's no obligation to tip 20%. To me, the service model, fair prices, and high quality are a combination of the best elements of counter service and full service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQwEdJ88aXsSlarpRs-9jcRwBTBo0B-hIa3KfE\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b84d3debc8f1cec""],""When"":""2021-4-19""},{""Name"":""Steve Morgan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmgrmzSyB3CC_qWamR3pXmaZna6-RxfqDluiFzTGNrypDReGc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very large service area.

Like the type of attitude you would think takes more effort than being nice.

The other reasons include that there just isn't that much choice on campus and the food is basic but decent here. The view is nice if you're out on the patio. And there's a lot of space. It's very sad that the sit-down nice restaurant didn't make it because that's exactly what the area needs. They just didn't promote it and since this is the top floor, no one discovers this space by walking by. The service at the Gallery when it was in the old sub was never this sad.

My recommendation is to get whatever just came out; as once I was lucky to just go when they were refilling their sweet bell pepper fried chicken it was really a solid restaurant level.

The ordering counter is downstairs with a seating area upstairs. It wasn't particularly clean: some tables had crumbs and there was trash on the floor under some tables, which weirdly is carpeted. The furniture, however, is in good condition and comfortable.\nFIRST VISIT: I had a felafel plate and a rice pudding. The food was average quality. The sauces they use are a little different than the typical sauces: the white sauce was thicker and tangier and the red sauce had a hint of heat but mostly tasted like a zestier and thinner version of ketchup (this is maybe not the most appealing way of describing it - it was good, like a cross between hot sauce and ketchup). I liked the different flavours and the rice was actually pretty good, but I was indifferent about the felafel and hummus. The felafels were like the puck-shaped ones you can buy at the grocery store. The rice pudding had a nice flavour but was almost gelatinous in consistency, which I can't decide how I feel about.\nSecond visit: I wanted to see if the more distinctly Persian dishes would be better, so I tried the eggplant stew, the one veg stew on the menu. The “broth” that the eggplant and tomato were stewed in was straight oil, which I did not like. Again the rice was great, but they give so much with the stew that I didn’t know what to do with it all.\nThe prices ($17 for the plate and stew w/ rice, $5 for the rice pudding) are fair for the amount of food you get, which is pretty generous. I finished the whole felafel plate but was very hungry, so if you have a smaller appetite you will have leftovers. Two people could easily split a rice pudding.\nThe staff seems very nice, but I just can’t see myself coming back for the food. I’d get the felafel again if it was the ONLY place to get felafel in town, but it is very much not."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNY72ngJ2ZaAwXFb3jb_xOhzFGMNLItp0KiPLjO\u0026fid=0x0:0x615e3b717137617d""],""When"":""2024-1-12""},{""Name"":""Abdullah K"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVaOLs3U1NGAh-EH96OS0WG3dhkXXnjYtovUMs7UYINOdg16mA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is my go-to place to eat on and around campus!

Unfortunately, the policies have changed and a beverage and gratuity is added, very fair, since I was told that some didn't tip, so the policy changed from this week. From this visit, the sauce amount has decreased, and the pasta has gone from al dente to harder, basically raw pasta.\n\nThe first plate of pasta was almost perfectly al dente but still slightly under what I preferred, and was still a treat to enjoy.  After the first plate, I had asked if the pasta could be made softer for the next.  They said that it would not be possible since the pasta is par-cooked.  However, for the next 2 plates, the pasta got harder and harder until I tasted flour and I decided to cut into one.  Well, it was raw inside (photo included).  At this point after 2.5 plates of hard pasta, I didn't feel like asking for it to be remade since they told me before that it wasn't possible.\n\nOverall, the food experience was marginally unacceptable after the first plate. The service was good and the sports bar atmosphere was excellent.   I recommend the rigatoni alla vodka sauce for the all access pasta since it tastes the best, pesto the second.\n\nAfter the complaint, I was told there had been a miscommunication that the pasta couldn't be cooked longer, and the drink cost was taken off as a result."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMb5h3FMgcqIKIxfIJ4PYZyyEEGjALlZXy1MfK1\u0026fid=0x0:0xfbcd82c95f6df084""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""Simon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWq3mMD7x0QRiQPROCB5BEqtJbykKAfvm5IFcPhyVt8QiitDIxq=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I got introduced to this place by a foodie influencer  (Howie) and got to enjoy a lot of their food.

If you ask for any kind of hot sauce, they will charge you $1.50 - SO BE CAREFUL! The Steak  Sandwich was *absolutely* delicious! The taste from the AAA medium-rare flat iron Steak with the  goat cheese and bbq sauce had such a really nice, umami flavour and mouth feel. It was just so delicious!\n\nI also ordered a Nashville Chicken Sando. No pictures taken as the first bite literally made me devour it on the spot! Will definitely come back again to take a photo.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Sports  Ilustrated Clubhouse. Nothing to say about their  interior or service.\n\nDefinitely recommend although I will say most items in the menu is quite expensive for the value.

Sitting varies from cafe tables, to Howarts style long tables or high-chair tables found in coffee shops. The food-serving area of the dinning hall is immediately at the place where you pay so you can line up to get your food. To avoid the line at the main entrance of the dinning hall, you can go to the back to pay as well.\n\nThe food here is okay. This is not a high-end restaurant. The food may not be for everyone. Also, there's a self serve ice cream machine, yogurt and salad bar. There are coffee machines and juice dispensers. There are plently of fruits, snacks and bread. At night, the pizza kitchen opens. Food is served in small to medium portion which is perfect for those who do not eat as much or want to try multple things. Chefs are polite and kind and will be willing to give you a bit of extra food if you ask.\n\nThere is no washroom in the dinning hall. You will have to leave the dinning hall and lose your ability to come back to use the washroom.\n\nIf you come here during regular meal times, expect there to be lots of students. If you come during 8:30am, 9:30 am or any time when class is in session, there are not as many people. Menu of the dinning hall can be found at both front and rear entrance.

The location is quite popular for students, with many tables filled by students with their laptops/books!

I could barely taste the oat milk in my decaf Americano, and the blend was not very strong itself. The hot chocolate was fine. The Mushroom Ricotta Rice Bowl ($13.95) had a nice marinade on the mushrooms, and a decent amount of ricotta (on a bed of rice and arugula). The rice is very plain, and perhaps a little mushy/overcooked.\n\nI was disappointed with their Midnight in Havana Rice Bowl ($15), having asked for no arugula, and it coming with the bowl anyways. The place was packed so I didn't feel like asking them to remove it. The pork shoulder was not tender (it was more like dry pulled pork). They were able to use a balsamic dressing instead of their garlic aioli at my request, which was nice of them to accommodate. There are some inconsistencies with their in-store menu and what's online on their Square site, as the Square site says the bowl comes with caramelized onions, but in-store it's pickled onions. On top of the pickled jalapenos, I thought it was too much acidity toppings wise and would have benefited from the caramelized type. Self-service after you receive your order.

The food available at Place Vanier comes from a variety of different cultures. Everyone will find something good to eat the dining hall. The dining hall can sit 200-300 people. It is a buffet style dining hall and you can get as much food you can eat.\n\nThere is a salad bar and custom sandwich making station. There is a  burgers, tacos, pork bun and pork belly ramen station. Food changes from time to time. It is best to check Nutrislice, the online menu app, to see what food the dining hall is serving before paying. The dining hall building has big windows overlooking the court yard of Place Vanier. You also have different kinds of seats like the Café style seats and also the long dining hall tables.\n\nDuring regular hours like mornings from 8-9am, lunch from 12-1pm, and dinner from 7-9pm, you will find lots of people there. You can avoid the traffic by avoiding these common times or arriving earlier to skip the potential line-up for food.\n\nThe presentation of the dish is average. The portions are small. Food is placed on the counter which may get cold and unclean. Food quality tastes ok, but the servers are more concerned about getting as much food out to as many students and people as possible. During peak hours, the place becomes hectic.  Food also is warm, not hot after peak times. Staff there are friendly and kind.\n\nWashrooms are downstairs, separate from the dining hall.\n\nParking is very close to the dining hall about a 5 minute walk.

I Iove the overnight oats, avocado toast and fajita bowl. A really good vegetarian station. Smoothie is my go to! Love the one with yoghurt, blueberries, chia seed, etc. Soup is pretty good too! They rotate all the time but I like their chicken soup, vegetables and legume curry, whatever bean soup, etc.\n\nGather has too much hate haha. It’s actually one of the healthiest and cheapest residence food among all the three.\n\nI wish they have more cooked green vegetables. They always have potatoes and squash but they don’t have enough broccoli, spinach, green beans, etc.\n\nGrill station is pretty good and they change menu around 2-4 weeks. Salmon burger is decent. I wish their chicken burger is cheaper.\n\nLatino is also my favourite. The Havana bowl is pretty good but sometimes they don’t season the chicken or tofu enough.\n\nHome cooking is also one of my favourite because they rotate the food daily. They have similar food every week. The vegetable lasagna with garlic bread is so good! Not a lot of cheese and love the sauce. Butter chicken is not really good imo.\n\nSandwich station is alright except they don’t have the press!!! Please we def need the press for sandwich especially for those who order with cheese.\n\nSimply local is a lot of people’s favourite. Not too expensive unless you get a main with two sides (around 12-14?). They serve beef brisket, pork chop, chicken breast, salmon and a vegetarian day every week."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPMSCT6VsYqtYkDRF-j31F88f1xfA6I9Q7h3tsB\u0026fid=0x0:0xe5bca09347600efd""],""When"":""2021-10-16""},{""Name"":""Dana Sullivan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWQIw-0oOUNgoyniYugTscGkgpKJS8tpx4V0tAajn3ZGkNIfqEk=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""They offer a great variety of food, including Latino, vegan, burgers, sushi-inspired, world (rotates often), baked goods, salads, and soups.

Their aggressive control of ingredient portions makes the prices totally unreasonable.\n- The $5 treats like brownies, lemon bars etc are made en masse and frozen, and kept too many days in a row: they taste like fridge and have poor texture. Absolutely not worth it. (the spinach and feta croissant is a bit more reliable)\n**Service**\n- Every single time I find myself wondering how the service is so slow. They don't train the team to be attentive to orders or to move with pace. On my last order, the kitchen person was picking mint leaves off of stems very slowly and chatting to the barista. They ignored or did not notice when the food order came out of the printer right by their face, and took a full 5 mins to start making the order. Once they did, they became distracted: I could hear the oven beeping after toasting the bun for a full min after it was finished before someone else picked up the task. Note, the cafe was NOT busy at this time. Just inefficient. Slowness is a theme every time I order from there.\n**Atmosphere**\nThis part is fine!

The Upmeals stuff is healthy and easy on the palate but interesting. In the past I’ve found that even some of the fresh baked goods somehow came out tasting stale, but this year’s iteration of UBC baking seems better. They’ve also instituted a Pearl Fever “pop-up” where you can get a limited selection bubble tea here (which is good, although I’ve only tried the jelly, which is harder to mess up than pearls) and also ice cream with taiyaki (the waffle is good, the soft serve is just okay - little icy - but it’s an accessible way to experience a fun dessert that’s a little hard to find).\nMy experience with the espresso drinks is - and I only drink decaf, so this may or may not be representative - it’s not awful, but it does taste a little over-roasted. Sometimes adding milk can mellow out bitter coffee but this one basically tastes the same in americano or latte form. The chai is not offensive but is made from a concentrate that’s very sweet and the London fog is also very sweet. Be careful because the hot drinks come out intensely hot. If you just need a coffee or tea, this will do the job, but definitely go somewhere else if you’re a coffee snob.\nAt peak studying hours, it’s crowded, but at off hours, the clean, quiet environment is very relaxing.\nGood place for students/UBC-people if you want a break from heavy food or fast food, not the place I’d necessarily recommend to campus visitors."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPCIoyH-0sdLvK7eGkdXRaADKQuUnvNnYAN71NY\u0026fid=0x0:0x38c96d30bcb01b2f""],""When"":""2023-8-29""},{""Name"":""Oakley Nance"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWwVuB38LSpIWv_yGP7nRej-Jw5m59HC-jukdf9PfQxIccZsQIsjA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I was the only person in line, i ordered and had to clarify my friends drink order, the bubble was literally typing as I was ordering and the lady asked if the drink was iced or hot.

The okay: pre-made sandwiches and wraps, sugar cookies and vegan cookie, dessert bars besides the date square, and tiramisu. The coffee is more variable but generally pretty good, and I think the matcha latte is actually one of the best on campus (or at least the smoothest). Do not order an iced London fog/turmeric fog though - they tell you they can make it, but you will get a cold tea bag in watery milk, not a properly steeped iced tea latte.\nThe students who work there are usually pretty friendly and the speed of service is reasonable even though the line gets long at lunchtime when school is in session.

I’m not in a place to say whether Indian food is “authentic” or not, but this was not the relatively bland take on Indian food that you might expect from this unassuming brunch place, it was pleasantly rich. And the paratha was so soft and flaky! The portion was also very filling, so good value for your money. I like that the Indian section of the menu has so many (vegetarian) breakfast dishes that most Indian lunch/dinner restaurants don’t serve. I’m kind of curious about the Western brunch menu too, but will definitely be back to try more of the Indian food if nothing else.\nI had a Piña Colada smoothie too. It wasn’t bad, but it didn’t really do anything for me. They called this a “fruit smoothie” but it was so sweet and tasted closer to a flavoured slush to me. I'd skip the smoothie next time since the main meal was enough.\nThe atmosphere is totally bare-bones, it’s not sketchy or anything, there’s just absolutely no ambiance to speak of. The staff was nice enough though, especially the person taking orders at the front. It’s not a hip brunch place at all, but a great place for some no-fuss good eats.

The menu was large, not overcrowded with menu items, and easy to follow. I ordered Bento Box A with beef (roughly $14) to go. I went at around 3pm on a Sunday, there were a few tables inside and I waited for just over 10 minutes for my food, which was a little longer than I had expected.  The packaging for takeout was pretty meticulous with everything being packed nicely in a large brown paper bag. The food was the typical bento box style food but everything was quite tasty. The beef to rice ratio was a bit lacking but the beef had adequate flavor and the added tamago (sweet eg) was a nice bonus. The California rolls were pretty good and the assorted tempura was light and did not leave an oily taste layer in my mouth.\n\nOverall, a pretty good first experience here at this new establishment on campus.

I've been waiting for almost five months since I first saw their signs, and it officially opened about a week ago. It's located inside the Lelem Village, which is great because there's a nice outdoor space where you can sit and enjoy the summer. There are also outdoor games available there.\n\nThe staff are nice and kind—I asked for additional sauce, and they happily gave it to me, so I'm giving them a 10/10 😛. The quality of the food is the same as at all other Popeyes locations: it's nice and tasty, perfect if you enjoy fast food. Everything is orderly and clean, and you can order ahead using the app and pick it up when you get there.\n\nI definitely recommend their hot wings and butterfly shrimp; both were really nice and tasty. Try all the different sauces—personally, I prefer the buttermilk ranch, but I also like the Cajun cocktail sauce, which is pretty unique to me.\n\nI'll definitely try more and update my review if anything changes. 🍤 🍗 🍟\n\n[Update, 2024, September]\nIt's been a while since I posted another review, but everything is still just as good. They’re now available on their website, and you can order ahead. The rewards in the app could be improved—they don’t quite match up to others, but still better than nothing. This time, I ordered the classic chicken burger along with fried onions and mashed potatoes. The onions are on another level—I really love them. The mashed potatoes are a bit spicy but still tasty. As for the burger, I personally prefer it with a bit of ranch, but honestly, with or without, it's still delicious.

love this place and it’s really surprising that the food is so good in this sad-looking hidden away food court.  They were open even when classes were not in session.  I love the Dan Dan noodle with 2 lamb skewers combo (comes with a canned drink).  Both were not too spicy for me, super tasty and generous portions.  I also had a breakfast crepe for the first time (ever. I’m just more familiar with Cantonese food) and it was so good and very large and filling.  I like their noodles which have a bit of a chew (look hand pulled rather than the skinny noodles you might expect normally in Dan Dan).  They were the same type of noodles in the meat sauce noodle dish (no soup).  The fried chicken is super crunchy so worth a try if you like fried chicken but I’m not looking for such an oily lunch/dinner.  Everything is fresh because it’s made to order.  They are open at night too. Looks like several of the other food court stalls did not open much.  Best thing to eat on the whole campus in my opinion.  Fair prices but if cost is an issue get their stamp card."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO8ICOnqvJ0g5JPS6M6p7-6Q0WHwEXrNY8NPAUg\u0026fid=0x0:0x97af90bfdba20390""],""When"":""2021-8-8""},{""Name"":""Sartaj Singh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU1doLfhIpPIdYO53EoD_63mHYE3jrQc1kxM-CAvFcju93a6Z1xPA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Decent food, decent price.

The staff is really chill and friendly so the vibe is great, and the food/drink is good all around. In particular they have some of my favourite scones around. Their veggie sandwich is very very good (as long as you're prepared for your hands to smell like focaccia for the rest of the day). Except for during the summer, they have a daily soup which is always very tasty. The regular dessert pastries (brownie, cookies, dessert bars) are all good but not stand-out good, but they sometimes have fancier cakes which are amazing.\nFor their drinks, it is also really hard to go wrong. The masala chai latte is amazing - it's sweet but also richly flavoured with spices. The London fog is also very good. Both of these tea lattes use stone ground tea instead of brewed tea which I think contributes to the intensity. They do a great job with the matcha latte too - it's never clumpy at all. I used to be not the biggest fan of their coffee, but it's grown on me a lot. It's a bit on the acidic side, but if you don't mind that, then the flavour is pretty nice. I really like their mocha too (especially the peppermint mocha available in winter) - this is actually the only place where I really get mochas!\nThey have pizza nights now (7-10 Wed-Fri) where you can get a flatbread pizza big enough to feed two for less than $15. Only the very basic flavours available (margherita, bianca, or pepperoni), but super tasty (and cheesy).\nThe seating inside is limited and the space is so narrow that I find it very hard to be comfortable inside unless you go during a rare quiet hour, but I love the patio, which is huge and mostly covered. They sometimes turn the fireplace on during the cold season."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPWhxuY6zE3pvpsEAp5I-7RS-wKJgHl_8B7qvR0\u0026fid=0x0:0x58f47ab4d39c9e95""],""When"":""2020-10-24""}]",

At 6 pm on the weekday for dinner, there was a lot of space available. There are options for indoor and outdoor seating. This will be great for friends, couples or groups of friends. Indoor seating can sit around 15 people. Outdoor seating can sit around 20 people. The chairs inside are small, and the space feels somewhat cramped.\n\nThe prices for the food are on the upside as per usual for restaurants near the university campus. Both my friend and I ordered the Pork Original with thick noodles. The portions were small (somewhat little noodles, two pieces of pork), but the thick noodles and broth tasted great. Service was fast, but servers are friendly and attentive.\n\nOur final bill came around to around $40 dollars which can be quite expensive for students or those living on campus in student housing. If the portions were more and the prices were cheaper, I will be returning here for more food. I would recommend people to try out this restaurant if they have not before, but not to rely here for a full stomach.\n\nThe washrooms are clean.

It's my first time here, but my 3 friends have been here before. The atmosphere and energy in the place was fun and upbeat. When I told the cashier it's my first time,  please explain to me the level of spicy that comes with the chicken....he yelled \""we got a first timer here!\"", and everyone in the back kitchen started shouting and cheering. That was different and created a fun atmosphere.  Let's get down to the chicken review 😋.  I ordered 2 piece with fries for $16.90, since I already had a drink in hand from somewhere else. I got it medium spicy. The chicken came with a slice of white bread underneath!? I was too carbed out to eat the bread. The seasoning and spice on the chicken was very tasty. It wasn't spicy at all, I liked the aroma. The fries were over fried, cause I don't taste the potato in it. Fortunately the seasoning made it easier to eat, so because of that I gave 5 stars for food since there's no 4.5 stars.  My friends all got the chicken sandwich or the waffle burger.....they loved it.

Some guests brought their own beer, and as a result, my friend (the groom) was charged an additional $500. On top of that, he was asked to RETURN THE NEXT DAY TO ASSIST WITH CLEANUP, which is completely unacceptable given the substantial amount spent on the event.\n\nWhile we understand that venues have their own policies, the complete lack of warmth and professionalism from the staff was inexcusable.

We were required to stay in the bar area, which felt limiting and confusing for a wedding celebration.\n\nTo top it off, the staff were unwilling to help with cleaning up the dance floor or removing decor, leaving the BRIDE AND GROOM to come back the next day to CLEAN it themselves. For such a special event, I’d expect more assistance from the venue, especially considering how much was spent. The location is beautiful, but the restrictive rules and lack of support from staff left much to be desired.\n\nTo add to that, a staff member was oddly strict about which cups we used and although the glasses were displayed on the counter.

I've never had any serious problem with the food quality here, but some ingredients seem to not be as fresh or as high-quality as I've come to expect from poke (again, never had anything that was bad, but it's just missing that pristine touch). I also find that some of the flavour combinations are kind of odd, like the pesto-marinated tofu and pineapple or very guac-like avocado scoops. But I still generally find their bowls satisfying if you know how to pick your ingredients. The Main and the Cali are my favourite standard bowls.

I am also grateful for the non-metal chairs!\nIt was 27°. We've just been cooling in the forests of the beautiful UBC Botanical Garden and not quite ready to drive back to the city. Westward Ho at the UBC Golf Course came up on my Google search for brunch. Their patio picture was the deciding factor. Since it was nearly Happy Hour, the pub wasn't crowded and we were able to get a table in the impressively big patio. Not sure if it would be equally impressive had it been a really sunny day. We'd have to check that out another time. On this cloud day, the patio was very bright – almost to the point where I have to put on my sun glasses.\nAs for the food, we had a hard time choosing: fresh fish and chips, fish sandwich, Beyond Beef burger, all day breakfast, etc. I ordered a Club House with multigrain yam fries, my companion ordered fresh Cod and Chips. The bread in my Club House was dried out, the sandwich did not look as scrumptious as the one with sour dough presented to the table next to us. My sandwich was too 'orderly', the chicken did not spill out of the sandwich like the one I saw earlier. I enjoyed the cod fish though – very fresh and not over battered. So, I guess I ordered the wrong thing! I liked the choice of using vinegar on coleslaw instead of mayo. A decent size coleslaw for a more balanced meal. MSG? For a few hours afterwards, I was very thirsty, but did not get the usual sickly feeling from eating MSG. So, not sure what was in the food that caused my tongue to feel so dry."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNjr8zNCvHQWWPDvIvCsF-m8vfK6OTg8xyORYzH\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2021-8-2""},{""Name"":""Azi Jahan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVoCqSGFWxXVxJxNnyUrYmJjWJKEtREeG-G0RXpmBRv8kbELxEL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""For gulf lovers for sure, it's a well-known place.\n\nBeautiful location and view🤌🏻\nDelicious brunch\nSo kind and supportive staff\n\nIt's a peaceful weekend brunch location if you are looking for a calm weekend's brunch🤩"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP4NKPC_4N4_VYCzznfOGLy34Q4VWIecJtPF0BY\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2022-7-29""},{""Name"":""Paul Rogers"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI-2DEuMMhV7vJRExrjz5OPFG99Ya8EpWqhlLnkXnZqRJpDqw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""My family went here with a few other people for dinner.

Firehouse Subs. Wow!! They’re so good. First of all, the best staff ever at the UBC branch—thanks for all the hard work there. We ordered for the first time and got two subs: one Montreal smoked meat and one NewYork Steamer, and we loved them. We loved them so much that we ordered again the next day—one Steak \u0026 Cheese and one Pepperoni Pizza Meatball—and again, we loved those. We’re probably going to keep ordering until we find our favorite. So far, we like these four in this order: Montreal Smoked Meat, Steak \u0026 Cheese, New York Steamer, and then Pepperoni Pizza Meatball. All of them are 7.5/10 or higher, so they’re really close. The pepperoni one is at the bottom of the list because the marinara sauce was a bit overwhelming, making it hard to really get to the pepperoni and meatball.\n\nWe also ordered the chili bowl and garlic bread. The garlic bread is nice—normal garlic bread. You could get creative and make it a bit more interesting, but I kind of liked it with their special sauce. But the chili bowl is on another level—so good.\n\nAs you can guess, I’m definitely going to keep trying them again and again. Hope they keep up the good quality. 🥖 🚒 🔥\n\n[Update, 2024, Aug 15]\nOrdered two new subs:\n1. Hat Trick Sub: A bit too much barbeque sauce, if you like bbq sauce a lot go for it. Enjoyed it. 7/10\n2. Smokehouse Beef \u0026 Cheddar Brisket: again a bit too smoky for me.

The flavor is, all I can say about this the best way to describe it, is this is a sexy sandwich! The staff were wonderful, talking to them I believe that they are treated very well by the owners. Which shows, cuz if you treat your staff father treat the customers well and they did, and they were good at their job as well. They all noticed when I walked in and when I left. The only thing I should mention, is I ordered a tuna (now I'm not sure why it wasn't on the board, but unfortunately there are some adjustments that could be made to the recipe. It might be, because when I enjoyed the sandwich, it was very wet, which tells me that when it was taken out of the can the fluid wasn't drained. So the Mayo is that was added was diluted a lot, Celeste liquid more mayo, as well the sandwich does need mustard for a tuna, and some black pepper would be ideal and a little bit of salt to bring out the flavor. )which was not on the board and I nearly walked out, except for the fact that I decided to ask just in case. So I think that listing that on the board would be great, cuz now I actually wonder what other hidden sandwiches you might have that are not listed. I will definitely be going back, and I don't even live in the city!

I’ve been here a couple times now with friends and the service staff are completely indifferent/unfriendly, the place seems disorganized, and it does not feel remotely comparable to any other Chipotle location I’ve been to. The portion sizes are not consistent from visit to visit and it seems as though the staff have taken some creative liberties as to how portioning and presentation should look. Every time my friends and I have visited this location, we have had to ask for more lettuce. They sprinkle it in the corner like it’s a garnish (picture attached was after asking for more). With the other toppings (corn, cheese) as well, they sprinkle minuscule portions with their fingers instead of using a standardized measuring device. I’ve only been during lunch rush, but I feel they start heavily skimping so that they have to do less prep or worry about changing containers mid rush. They do not follow “fifo” procedures (first-in, first out) and my friend and I (who both have experience in the food service industry) watched them on multiple occasions just dump new prep on top of older prepped toppings instead of switching containers. It’s about half the portion of food you’d get at any other Chipotle, which is a shame since you’re paying the same $17-$20 price tag. Seeing more experienced individuals in food service or service management at this location would be nice, in place of the youthful and evidently lacking in training/experienced staff at present. My friends and I have been here 3-4 times now but I don’t think we will continue as it stands.

I find that the decaf espresso in drinks has kind of a burnt taste; it’s alright in lattes, but I had it as an americano today and it wasn’t really worth it for me.\nOn the upside, the value is decent. The pastas and flatbreads are heartier fare than you’ll find at most of the coffee shops (UBC-owned or not) around campus, and my pasta and (big) cookie today came out to about $14 total.

This establishment prides itself on prompt service and observant staff, showcasing an unwavering dedication to guest contentment. In fact, there were staff hovering near the entrance the entire time looking for tables to clear or anyone needing anything.  As a dog lover, the inclusive pet-friendly policy significantly enhanced our dining experience, contributing to the overall laid-back vibe of the place.\n\nThe outdoor seating area presented a slight hiccup, as only half the tables benefit from the shade, either natural or via umbrellas. However, after a short wait, we managed to nab a shaded spot for our meal.\n\nA point worth noting is the slightly elusive location of the restrooms, hidden within the upstairs hostel. This required a minor search, but the overall experience outweighed this minor inconvenience.\n\nThe charm of DICED lies within its simple but well done menu. The irresistible Cuddle burger has managed to capture the hearts of many, including mine. The unbeatable combination of delectable flavor and affordable pricing make it a standout choice!\n\nA crucial aspect not to be forgotten is the cafe's commendable work within the community. Functioning as a social enterprise, DICED invests in shaping the future of young adults in the culinary field. Every delicious meal served is a testament to their commitment towards empowerment and opportunity.\n\nTo top it off, we found free street parking just one block away, saving us the usual parking hassle.

Very warm atmosphere, from the design of the inside to the friendly service. Because the place is relatively small, it’s probably not a good idea to bring a large group, but it’s a nice place for a smaller hang or even to chill by yourself. I have been curious for a while and just tried it with some friends. I probably will be back.\nThey have a great drink menu with lots of specialty cocktails and nonalcoholic drinks. I got a nonalcoholic pineapple guava soda. I don’t like drinks that are too sweet and this was good for me, but some people might find it weak compared to commercial fruit sodas.\nI got a soup and sandwich combo as my entree with the Eggplant Caprese sandwich and the Crab Bisque. I really liked this take on a caprese sandwich, and the baguette was very fresh and soft. The bisque was very good too. Rather than being a super creamy bisque, this was more tomato-based and a little tangy. Good flavour with a fair amount of crab meat. I also liked the little side of coleslaw that was included in the combo.\nWasn’t really planning on getting dessert but then I saw they had a Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding, and I will rarely pass up on bread pudding. It was delicious but, as you might expect from bread pudding made of banana bread, with ice cream, with caramel sauce, VERY rich and heavy, and I had to get some help to finish it. I think this would be ideal for splitting between two people.\nFor this meal, with tip, I paid $48, which surprised me. I thought it was a good meal, but not $50 good - I’d associate that kind of price with a more upscale experience than this. I can understand the soup and sandwich pricing, the dessert was a little expensive, but what really strikes me as obviously overpriced would be the $8 soda. I understand it’s made in house, but it was just a fruity soda - no fruit bits or anything fancy, and no alcohol. It was a nice refreshing drink, but for $8 I wouldn’t say it was worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMA-33yhxlhuJWzrEmE3NBivENZ-qwhvFcoFjxN\u0026fid=0x0:0x57c0ba4874667b57""],""When"":""2023-5-20""},{""Name"":""Keith Ver"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXVdqxLCf1LEt0AU82myo-eUqDcb2LcbdnfhupJTEW0sPAQ-qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Good food and good service!
