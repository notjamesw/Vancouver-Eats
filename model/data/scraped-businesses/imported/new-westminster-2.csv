Especially the avocado smoothie; which can be hit or miss depending in where you go."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPM9WoJtve4mc4YRD5SngoWgff5ciCIEknPoGA\u0026fid=0x0:0xef6261bd8b77bcd6""],""When"":""2024-8-22""},{""Name"":""Kingramen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU35K9K-3WDR1LhMOarmobzfUiY3qJQT45Dn4vfHiWAkp32qFPGKA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The Bun Bo Hue was good, soup was tasty, not too spicy.

We paid by weighing everything in the pot. Mine was $36 😮.  But we got free tea and ice cream at the end.\n4. Many servers always asking how things are, but my friends food came 15 min after mine.

You don’t get to screw over regular people who are just trying to survive on a constant basis and not have any repercussions.

Stopping in an hour before closing on a weekday, we found the familiar comfort of a well-oiled machine running on cruise control, but we felt like the staff was getting ready to leave.\n\nThe nachos arrived as they always do – adequately portioned, properly layered, neither inspiring poetry nor causing complaint. They're the kind of nachos that make you think, \""Yep, those are nachos alright.\"" The drinks followed the same path of calculated adequacy – they'll get the job done, but they won't make you forget your favorite cocktail bar.\n\nWhere Browns does shine is in its consistency. It's like that old sweater you keep coming back to – not because it's spectacular, but because you know exactly what you're getting. The patio offers a pleasant escape, and the service maintains that professional warmth that's become the chain's signature.\n\nThis Browns Social House isn't trying to reinvent the wheel – they're just keeping it reliably rolling. For a casual meet-up with friends, whether it's lunch, dinner, or late-night bites, it's a safe bet. You won't walk away with a story to tell, but you won't walk away disappointed either.

Beside the fryer was a large pot of fresh rice sitting on the stove as well. For salad you can choose to have a little bit of everything (lettuce, pickled beets, cucumbers, tomatoes, tabouli, pickled red onions, and pickles). They had hummus and tzatziki sauce as options and after the meat was piled on you are also given more sauce options (hot sauce and tahini). They also offer pita to compliment your meal (great with the sauces).

My husband went back to the store to confirm and the employee tried to argue that I had ordered the “recipe pizza”. Eventually they admitted that you CAN get the pepperoni pizza with the special so there was no reason to charge regular price for it, especially since I had referenced the special.  Eventually, my husband was given a $5 refund (the total difference was $5.65 lol. Oh well, by now, the amount we were owed was no longer the point).\n\nAll that to say, if the employee had charged me the regular price by mistake, I wouldn’t be mad. But to lie and say the special was “online only” to avoid honouring the deal is pretty scummy.\n\nAn email to their corporate office did not yield anything besides a scripted apology and response saying they will forward this to the appropriate team to address with the individuals involved.\n\nAll in all, pretty disappointed that none of the Pizza Pizza representatives proactively tried to make this right.

It's fine if you just want a quick batch of pancakes from their classic pancake mix but when branching into other parts of their menu I've been disappointed by the ingredients and the quality of the cooking.\n\nRecently tried their avocado toast with medium poached eggs - advertised to have grilled bread, avocado and roasted cherry tomatoes. The bread was just a plain piece of Dempsters or something, not grilled in the pan nor toasted for more than 10 seconds, the cherry tomatoes were raw with some blackened edges, probably thrown in a very hot pan for 10 seconds. The eggs were hard poached with the whites totally falling apart and swimming in a pool of water. Really disappointing. The eggs also seem to be the cheapest kind of eggs (not free range) based on the very bright yolk colour and lack of richness of the yolk.\n\nI've found the omelettes also dont have much egg flavour - I suspect both due to them using cheap eggs and using a bit of pancake mix in the omelette to give it the fluffiness, resulting in the egg tasting a bit bland, so it relies on the cheese and other toppings to carry it in the flavour department. But they are a generous portion size for the price.\n\nI also noticed plastic is chipping/shredding off the spout of the coffee carafes so I'm hoping there arent little bits of plastic melting off into my coffee as I pour...

We had a server named Hussain and he was extremely rude to us. First off, when we arrived, he never clearly stated when he would be taking our orders. He would just stand in a corner with his notepad thinking that we could read his mind. We did have a few people in our party that were more vocal than others so they made their orders known, but then he would openly roll his eyes at them for making many requests. For people like me who would quietly wait for a server to approach and ask us for our order, he would never do that because he would stand SO far away from our table and just walk away if no one directly called for him. I shouldn’t have to yell that I want something from across the room. He also brought our drink orders incorrectly so I’m not even sure if he heard us properly since we had to yell across the room to order. When he finally did come to take our individual orders, he crouched at the corner of our table and didn’t move individually to each person so the person at the far end of the table didn’t hear when it was her turn. When he was waiting for her order he just shouted, “um excuse me, HELLO” but she didn’t see him as he was crouched and far away since it was a long rectangular table. When we asked for water, he brought a pitcher but left it on a completely different table far away (we were in a special group room) and so we had to get up ourselves and bring the pitcher and cups to our table (for reference, our table didn’t even have food on it yet so it was clear). He took forever in between orders and gave us attitude with every interaction. Luckily however, he only took our orders. A different lady brought all our food and was super sweet and accommodating for the rest of our requests when we asked for takeout containers and other things. She was extremely tall, her hair was in dreadlocks, and wore glasses. I wish we received service with her the entire time instead of our other server Hussain.\n\nThe food itself was pretty decent, I ordered the ribs and they weren’t dry at all, but the service we received definitely took away from the experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN_O8zT5bIGOhyatx-4AVTl5IKG71o6-Q-u132X\u0026fid=0x0:0x99e6edd948ed2527""],""When"":""2024-6-15""},{""Name"":""Danielle Bertsch"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLdkmuiv2cRnHyHhY_fQK5g3Rx7POQeI0iZN-dw6fgHHp6ZaQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Their happy hour menu is always a great value.

It offers quite a decent list of beverages. I found their choice of IPAs to be a bit weak, but after pandemic re-opening, they introduced Mariner IPA to the list, and it's a game-changer for me. Service is slow at times, mainly because the place is packed, and there's only one waitress, but it's bearable. We never went past appetizers, but I can tell that wings are good, and mozzarella triangles are nice when cheese stays inside, which doesn't happen always, and you get triangles with no cheese inside. Also, I'm not sure if it's a post-pandemic measure, but now the kitchen closes at 8 pm. For us, somehow missing the last kitchen call, it was the end of the night. One other thing that I really liked, which is not available anymore in COVID-19 reality for very obvious reasons, is that they used to have a popcorn machine where patrons could get a free popcorn – it's genius. I can't say that this pub is perfect, but they are trying to be so, and I can see why many locals like it.

Their Raita was on the other hand, over portioned. But all in all really good food and service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOsMIuqXRQkmmVae-4LjhOtqlGCoX1SKWxOPeaW\u0026fid=0x0:0x7dd7f0b272a60b60""],""When"":""2023-9-29""},{""Name"":""Coleen C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUauoBULHRivIFwYCvu4BqvyF8VvNRVLHo1AYN5p3b5oAIqNmsS=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My first dining experience here was amazing!

The dinner platters are served with rice, potatoes and 2 kinds of salad. We typically order Greek and Caesar salad.\n\nGuests are served fresh, hot pita bread, covered in melted butter.

Specifically, the special instructions I added weren't followed, when on past orders they have been. I asked for mashed potatoes as my 2 large sides instead of the salads. For some reason their website, app and drive through menu don't list mashed potatoes as an option, even though they have them. Also, I upgraded my 2 fries to mega individual for an additional $1 total. I also asked for thigh only dark meat for the chicken. These 3 requests weren't met. I didn't check everything until I got home because the drive through was busy and it would have been a hassle opening all those containers in my car.\n\nI provided feedback through the app. The next day I got a call from the store manager. She apologized and offered me 6 pieces of chicken, 2 large mashed potatoes and 1 large gravy as a resolution and acceptance of responsibility. I honestly wasn't expecting I would ever hear back at all. For this generous offer and the apology, which I accepted graciously, I give HUGE props to this store and manager for correcting and maintaining a positive customer relationship.\n\nThen today I get a letter from KFC corporate apologizing and including a $10 coupon toward any purchase. Again, I didn't ask for our expect this! Well done again!\n\nAlso, at the drive through the workers wear masks, use hand sanitizer frequently and will substitute drinks for gravy without hassle of charge.\n\nThe food is enjoyable; the chicken tastes fresh, moist and has that yummy 11 herbs and spices goodness!

Ordered it with a side of ceasar salad thinking who messes up salads. Well, if you like eating whole cloves of baked garlic, then this is for you. I was not expecting to find a whole piece of garlic clove when I took a bite off my salad and it threw me off. Not sure if it was intentional but not a fan.

There was coleslaw/carrots instead of lettuce, there were no pickles on my sandwich, which is one of the best parts of a chicken sandwich. There were a few tiny chunks of diced onion in the mix with the coleslaw. And there was no truffle mayo either.

Around 6:45 I walked up to the heat lamps and asked for service and demanded we get service. They came with the food we ordered! Yay? Nay.... it was cold and dried. Absolute garbage but still no server to be seen. I grabbed all my plates of food and brought it back to the heat lamps and told them it's all dried and cold.\n\nAround 7pm somebody, I believe was a line cook or dishwasher, helped bring some food out. 1 out of 3 items served.

Disgusting.\n\nA food runner came by with our 2 other plates while the table next to us finished their meal and I told her about it. She said she will bring it to her manager and did not come back since.\n\nWhile eating the other 2 plates we noticed smaller things we could live without complaining to them. Bunched up calamari, unmixed and smaller portion of the Jambalaya, a random pasta that looked like a kids pasta in the Jambalaya.\n\nStill no sign of the server. Another food runner came by at the end and said our meal was taken care of and apologized for everything.\n\nI used to frequent another Boston Pizza location that was closed down. I'm not coming back ever."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO3otXGw4aI1aOeypbrytEoOSDZFwT1Ov-kfcOq\u0026fid=0x0:0xf56f0ca3eefb9c0""],""When"":""2023-2-15""},{""Name"":""James Coles-Nash"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkJrmtjWT371XtK4SkdD-gc4742YrtKT1KSibl27VRSYpTt9Yi=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""Sooo bloody slooooow, took 10 minutes to get seated in an empty restaurant, 30 to get our order in, 30 to wait for food, and another 15 to get our bloody bill!

Highly recommend the Chef's Best pizza and the Halibut - they were definitely our favourites. Duck was also really enjoyable - the cherry reduction went super well with the meat, but it is a bit pricey as the dish only came with 2 pieces of duck. We were quite disappointed at the Duck \u0026 Fig pizza as everything was too dry, feels like there is not enough sauce/fig jam. The Halibut itself was cooked to perfection with amazing texture, but the sauce is waaay too salty. For dessert we ordered the lemon tart and the affogato.

It’s a stone’s throw away from New Westminster Station - giving plenty of options to have someone else drive you home after (Skytrain, bus, taxi).  I did make reservations a week in advance and that process was quite smooth.\n\nOur server, Stefan was awesome!  He welcomed us quickly when we stepped in and checked in on us often.  We were 1 of 2 tables occupied on a Thursday evening before a long weekend - service was really great and only slipped a little once the small room filled up with a number of larger groups.\n\nOur table was small so with the combo of drinks and snacks we dropped cutlery a couple of times but Stefan was quick to zip in and provide a replacement right away without asking.  He was also creating drinks at the bar constantly while providing really great customer service.\n\nMy friend who “likes to drink in dark places” loved this place, the drinks were strong and the snack food is decent.\n\nThe Boulevardier Cocktail - the best one I’ve found since discovering it on a cruise ship several years ago and decently priced.  This sweeter cousin of the Old Fashioned was strong and I like the additional effort with their prep of the maraschino cherry.\nCucumber Collins (non-alcoholic) - a “rest” drink in between drinks, it offered that fizzy light relief I was looking for.  It’s nice that a prohibition style bar still had a handful of non-alcoholic beverages.  The price was a little on the higher side, but OK.\nLong Island Teapot - we split it for 4 and it was perfect.  It was strong and the teapot/tea cups were a nice touch.  We ended up staying so long we got this at their Happy Hour price which made it worth it - regular price I’m not so sure other than the fancier presentation.\n\nFood: overall the prices were decent for what we did try - we did mostly snacks and I’ll be back to try more.\n\nCrab stuffed mushroom caps - solid offering - even a crazier price at happy hour - would highly recommend\nNacho basket - they tasted good - size was like a half nacho order.  If you like nachos but don’t want to commit to a large basket this is it.\nToasted Walnuts - so great - even better than the ones you get on a plane - really enjoyable when fresh \u0026 warm - price was on a little bit of a higher side but no stale walnuts here… worth it in my opinion\nArancini balls - could’ve been better - not sure what happened but based on what I experienced not sure it was worth the $3.33/ball - more worth it at Happy Hour at close to half price.\n\nI’m really happy with this place and have already started recommending it to my foodie/drinking buddies.  It’s pretty unique and it’s close to transit which is a big selling point.  Drinks are strong and well-priced, food is decently priced for the area.  Small tweaks are needed but overall solid for a fun night out with your friends.\n\nAlso the customer service was awesome - thanks Stefan and the Flapper Lounge team!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPQn1PCxcM0GbvYo0E3gnIbUqvLj22OxYEACMzx\u0026fid=0x0:0x641e1455134a9e30""],""When"":""2024-3-30""},{""Name"":""Brigitte Danis"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ60G9H1oSjnh6iz4UwUMjxsTkrvs-7aTGl6fkY55gbzK3cPA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My friends reserved a table for happy hour at the Flapper Lounge, a speakeasy we were visiting for the first time.

Everything I have gotten has been absolutely tasty and fun. I always check their Facebook page to see if they have any seasonal or holiday special drinks. I got one during the Halloween season and it was soooo yummy.\n\nThe waiter, whom I think is also the owner is so kind and helpful and just a great guy overall. I can tell he really takes pride in his establishment . We told him we think it would be so awesome if one day they are able to expand and maybe bring in live music. It is a small place but the ambiance is very cool and reminiscent of the roaring 20s and days of prohibition. The last time we went we could tell they had also updated their decor which made for a much more elegant feel.\n\nI will say we have had 50/50 experience with the food. One time we got the Arancini, and although the flavor was good, the rice itself was hard, maybe not cooked all the way. But last time we went we got the Nachos and they were on happy hour so I think it was only $10 and they were a great snack and so worth it.\n\nSo definitely give it a try, the drinks are great, fun place to bring a date or small group of friends to start of your night, and totally the place we should be supporting."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNaMC-FrGl_NQQebBPZp2PqrMzELpZygriNAJl6\u0026fid=0x0:0x641e1455134a9e30""],""When"":""2024-3-31""}]",

The Insanity was a huge burger with the buns substituted by a full grilled cheese sandwich. For a sense of scale, half a burger is way larger than a regular burger on its own. The burger itself was good. The grilled cheese was simple yet it is everything you expected - crispy bread, cheesy center, and the patty was done well, flavourful and juicy. With that said, I found the 4 layers of bread a little too much carb for the burger's proportion, so we ended up eating the top \""bun\"" separately. Needless to say we were STUFFED after the meal. The wings are pretty standard, what you will expect at most pub-restaurants. The sauce is sweet and tangy with a bit of kick but not too special.\n\nOverall, a very decent place for some specialty gourmet burger.

Crispy potato wedges, but they were cut a little too thick. So, that was a bummer.\nBurger patty was roasted well but it had that meat smell and also was bland with the meat’ish taste. Something has to be figured out that the patties are flavorful and doesn’t have that raw’ish meat taste \u0026 smell. We had to add more and more ketchup and sauce to make it flavorful. This experience did not match with the recommendations and hype we got about this restaurant before our first visit.\nJust to be clear, we have been to more than 15 countries and have tasted good burgers. We know how a good burger should taste like. If there’s a raw’ish meat smell and taste in the patty, then it needs improvement.\nI hope cooks will pay attention to this constructive feedback.

limit of an hour and a half abut didn’t take our order until just over 30 minutes after arrival and we didn’t receive or food until an hour after placing our order. If they had tried to enforce the time limit I would have made a big deal at that point. During our time there no one came to see if we wanted more drinks, my Nonna’s coffee never got refilled after making her wait 25 minutes for it in the first place and overall the service was actually pretty bad. I’ve been serving for almost 20 years so I get it, sometimes you’re slammed but there’s steps to take in between taking and order and delivering an order that need to be taken to ensure guest satisfaction. You need to tell people that food will be a longer wait. You tell them that their meal is coming, it will take a little longer than expected but is there anything else you can get them in the meantime while they wait. It’s just common courtesy as a server to practice that behaviour. On top of that, if guests are going to be waiting a longer time for food, the food that they’re served should be hot upon arrival. Making guests wait a hour for food without any notice isn’t great, but it’s absolutely unacceptable for them to receive cold food after an hour long wait.\nThe food was pretty terrible too. Undercooked vegetables, dry and overcooked meat, dry potatoes, flavourless and soggy Spätzle all served to us lukewarm or cold. The only tasty thing on the Menu was the blaukraut but the rest was not palatable. It kinda just added insult to injury for all of us that we had to wait for such lacklustre food.\nMy sister planned this birthday dinner for my nonna and I could see how sad she was when food took so long and especially after everyone started to complain because the food was terrible. I don’t think any of us will be returning to this restaurant when there’s the Old Bavaria Haus or even the Italian Restaurant Piva we could have gone to. All of us came over an hour out of our ways to go here and it was not worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMQAmeFJCrVxK33I2SpnHQmeyMO3_WzTwuhDLKn\u0026fid=0x0:0x7900e35e4cfe6178""],""When"":""2024-12-15""},{""Name"":""Naveen Sivasankar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVD85c8-gPz6lah-8hC6Wc52PIW1l9gF6x2wQmy27iEI7TaAflN=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""This was a good introduction to German cuisine, but there are some things that could make the experience better.\n\nThe atmosphere was great!

It was a plump, flavourful sausage that was perfectly complimented with sauerkraut and mustard.\n\nThe baked camenbert was paired nicely with cranberry sauce and seemed to be lightly coated with breading, giving it a nice outer texture.\n\nI enjoyed the goulash, but it was a bit too watery for my taste.\n\nWe got the Schnitzel Champignon, which was nicely breaded and flavourful. However, I felt that there were not enough sauteed mushrooms in the dish. The schnitzel came with a very nice cabbage side, potatoes and some vegetables. The portion size is fairly large, and we shared the one order between the two of us.\n\nFor dessert, we got the black forest cake, which was absolutely amazing.

around 9:15 PM, and while it wasn’t crowded, it had a pleasant vibe. The ambiance is fantastic—warm, welcoming, and with a cozy, homely vibe. The staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable, making the experience even better.\n\nFood:\n•\tOnion Rings (Onion Pakora): The portion size is massive—500 grams, easily enough for four people. It’s absolutely delicious and brings a wave of nostalgia. 5/5\n•\tChai: Easily one of the best chai I’ve ever had. 5/5\n•\tVada Pav: Authentic Mumbai-style, served with mirchi on the side. 4.5/5\n\nThe food is extraordinary, and each dish feels unique. The menu itself is very good, they wrote their story which is inspiring,  and descriptions of each dish, giving diners a deeper connection to the food.\n\nThe decor is inspiring and distinctly Indian. The large Shivaji wallpaper is an eye-catching centerpiece, and the walls are decorated with vibrant paintings.\n\n✨One unique feature stole my attention —a display that automatically changes numbers every 30 seconds when a person follows on their Instagram. It’s innovative and something I’ve never seen before, not even in renowned places like Chef Ramsay’s restaurants.

Similar to Gujarati food I’m most familiar with.\n\nI’ve had a few days to think this over and I really want to support VadaPav, however there are a few concerns I wasn’t pleased about:\n- the service was quite slow and bringing out the starters at the same time as a main was surprising but not all our meals came together too so it was a wait for the rest to appear especially when you want to start a meal together.\n- Unfortunately they didn’t have the items I wanted on the menu: “We’ve run out” which didn’t seem possible as we went for an early lunch. They did however suddenly have one starter at the end of our meal once the owner came to talk to us. Not complimentary of course.\n- the prices, imo, are very expensive for the little quantity I personally ordered. The stainless steel plates looked empty compared to the photos on the picture menus (see photos for my order).\n- there were 3 of us adults, we ordered 2 mains and 3 starters. No drinks. Our total paid was $110. Again exorbitant for the little quantity of food received.\n- the signature VadaPav is tasty (and so glad no onions) but think it would be better if the two tiny bread rolls were warmed instead of super cold?\n\nI hope they take my comments to note and I really do wish them well."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP_QVK_SOoH9TBcCvx8-a9fF9eVlkjXlM1osIDF\u0026fid=0x0:0x4f70b6c0bdafc7a9""],""When"":""2024-8-2""},{""Name"":""Jasleen Kaur"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJq_mX4JcS2qCxDJUdxLM5cEoBdw7wYfyUdfHLGfdunsmqsnw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This was my first time visiting this restaurant, and I must say, it was a delightful surprise!

The spiciness is accurate, so go easy when selecting how hot (spicy) you like your dishes. Thai iced tea and coffee are always a must, and now that mangoes are back in season, the sticky rice dessert with mango is my favorite go-to. Thank you for the excellent service and great conversation, Teg. Will definitely be back to try out the massaman curry!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPTAuOLtVWKJYgaZYrY5m1nhy_6HZ-QkcFfC-fw\u0026fid=0x0:0xe0893b2f51a5f111""],""When"":""2023-4-29""},{""Name"":""Caroline F"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFeqi-yOkJqxICGJeCmlK4j8ZRrRYo85n_bkRB4GiJhIL8HJP9=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It is a small place but it felt like we're in a fine dining restaurant minus the white linen with a spa-like ambience.

The bacon was good and cooked well and I enjoyed my black coffee.\nThe atmosphere could use some cleaning, the entrance glass door and walls and sockets for eg.

I didn’t really enjoy my meal, but everyone else at my table really really enjoyed their meals. I’m definitely going to come back and try something different.

I’m not a good cook but I’m sure I can make better pasta than the food they served us… They have 4 dessert options on the menu, but we were told they only had Tiramisu and Affogato. The so called “Tiramisu” tasted awful and overly sweet.\n\nEnvironment: The moment we walked into the restaurant, we could smell washroom… There were also so many fruit flies flying around us during our dinner. Though the space was wide and my husband and I could enjoy a quieter space (because there were only 2 other groups in the restaurant who sat in different corners), you can tell this restaurant is aged but not well maintained.\n\nService: The lady who took our order and served us was the only good thing about this restaurant.\n\nSometimes if the environment of a restaurant is not clean but the food is tasty, we would probably be okay with it, but this restaurant I really can’t justify the $100 we paid for the poor quality of food we got.

It’s Sunday and 5:30 pm. She was the one without glasses. She was literally dictating my order. I had a guest tonight from out of town who asked me if I could recommend a good restaurant and I brought him here to have shrimp no. 8. I ordered for both of us when she suddenly asked my friend if he eats shrimp what I had just ordered. My friend doesn’t normally eat shrimp but he wanted to try. The girl insisted that your friend doesn’t want shrimp embarrassing me in the process. Then I was ordering the bigger one no. 8.

I just had the Cajun pork which was marinated in a great, just spicy enough marinate and grilled on the spot, served with rice and veggies. You talk to people who go there and they'll rave about pretty much everything on the menu.  This is the kind of place you want to see succeed because they seem like genuinely good guys and they're passionate about the food.  And they have a great system to keep things flowing even when it's busy.

Located inside a mall, the restaurant offers plenty of free parking and a separate entrance from the outside. Initially, the small door from the mall and the dim lighting made us unsure if it was open. My daughter even asked, “Is it open? Why is it so dark in there?” However, once inside, we were greeted by a warm and inviting ambiance.\n\nDespite it being 6 PM on a bustling Saturday, we managed to snag one of the last tables. Our server was exceptionally friendly and accommodating, although she did forget to place our order and my daughter’s apple juice. After a 40-minute wait, she apologized sincerely, assured us she would expedite our order, and offered us complimentary dessert as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived, it was worth the wait. The portions were generous, and I ended up taking some home. I had the roast lamb, which was incredibly tender and fell off the bone. My daughter, a notoriously picky eater, enjoyed her salmon in tomato sauce, possibly because of the long wait. My husband had the lamb souvlaki, and our friend tried the potato-crusted cod—both dishes were delicious.\n\nTo top off our meal, our server brought us ek mek, a Greek dessert, on the house. Despite my usual preference for chocolate desserts, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, Yiannis Greek Taverns exceeded our expectations, and I wouldn’t hesitate to return the next time I’m craving Greek cuisine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN7PQfPHYYweZZsaIMbYUDpVrWoFnfl9YSzp__W\u0026fid=0x0:0xaa8584956b498880""],""When"":""2024-11-10""},{""Name"":""Bob Ilapogu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXD-elaNhBNUvlaxka6eecnsUdCevkSM7CivjrbdDP1sf2qzFrO=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We had a medical appointment nearby, with about 40 minutes to spare.

Almost nowhere to park there except a few paid spots here and there.\n\nWhen we came in we were greeted quickly and our server came to take orders fairly quickly as well. Then it all went downhill from there.\n\nWe ordered the prime rib medium rare. Although the color was great, the top of the steak was all dried from sitting there too long after cutting. The meat was also tough. The soup was broccoli and bacon and it was quite salty and the croutons were stale. We got the lattice fries which everyone raved about. The fries were ok but seasoning was only on a few.\n\nWe also ordered the seafood pesto fettuccine which claims it has lobster. It came with a lot of tiny shrimps and imitation crab. No lobster meat to be found. I thought for almost $30 for the pasta, there'd be some lobster bits. The garlic bread was good and the pesto sauce was delicious though.\n\nWhen we were done, we wanted to get the bill and pay. Since this bar only allows one server per table, no other servers were willing to serve us. We waited over 20 min for our server to notice us looking at her. She was too busy at the drink bar making drinks. We got the bill, the -$30 was taken off for the birthday discount, we paid, and the server quickly just went away. No happy birthday or any goodbye greeting. She was just too busy.\n\nDon't think we'll be returning here as regular customers."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMA5_-zgUj6YIJrCcdVvatTtnqiciOW39MU9G70\u0026fid=0x0:0xb99a55913f8089e4""],""When"":""2024-6-30""},{""Name"":""Sandeep Patil"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWkfias45QhgRJ8x-jbidsLsdJf1V8WF5xtbY2Qhjx8BL_-hxwg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Located at convenient spot next to river Fraser and river parks, Kelly's allow you to relax down after a long walk by riverside of New Westminster.

I ordered laing and fried galunggong with rice, which they categorized as combo 2. The rice texture was a mix of soft and hard grains. It tasted  like they mixed the left over ones with the newly cooked. The laing was blant in taste and a disappointment, the galunggong was served with vinegar but even the sauce was somewhat plain for the taste. If the management wants to hold of their regular customers, and wants them coming back,  the taste of the food shouldn’t be compromised . Their prices are a bit high and the diners should get their money’s worth with good food tastes. Also, they should refrain from upselling other food products since the customers can view them anyway. If they want to buy desserts or other snacks, they will do so even without the hard sell. As a Filipino we wanted to patronize the businesses of our co- Filipinos but when we feel shortchanged with the service we will be avoiding coming back again buying their goods. Hopefully, I was able to air my constructive criticisms with regards on how they can improve their service to their paying customers. I am just stating a fact based on my experience.\n\nThis is in response to your statement that nobody is perfect which I found very unwelcoming of customers complaints. If you feel slighted on an honest opinion from your regular customer then no one will dare point out a constructive feedback. It looks like you’re just open to good criticism even in reality not every paying customer is satisfied by the foods they eat. Sorry if you feel the negative side of a positive feedback.

But the group was too big and the orders took a long time.\n\nAll the while, this staff was extremely patient with us, and wasn't angry at all, eveb though some people in our group weren't being the most respectful. It took 30 minutes to get everyone's order, and it was already last call.\n\nBy the time they were closing up, we were paying our bill. Some people in our group were taking a group photo, and our waitress offered to take one for us.\n\nBubble World is always my favorite Taiwanese restaurant because it was one of the first ones in greater Vancouver. I'm glad that the quality of both food and service has not changed."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOcxyFQ1w2izaz0eVZkQmEz4FUNvW_WGngLKCfi\u0026fid=0x0:0x6fe36ebfc5020a42""],""When"":""2024-9-30""},{""Name"":""Jeff Feng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWD04N7yAqK5bQW4CKDPzu-YbWI12ot70TbAi4lhM4-9KR2NVFH-w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The food here has no right to be this good.

I couldn't resist mys self to try this Thaali. I am big fan of Indian Thalis.\n\nThey said, You can choose any Curry from their menu for Thaali, which surprised me (that means they make  fresh curry for only for your Thali). I have chosen non-veg Thali (13.49$) option which comes with one veg and one chicken Curry (no lamb and shrimp included in Thali), one plain naan, Rice and Raita. I have selected Karahi Paneer (veg Curry)  and Chicken tikka Masala ( non-veg Curry). The ambience is good, very clean and good service. The food is not at it's best but I can say it's worth for the given price. It is far better than eating junk food by paying 20$ on your work day lunch. The paneer Currey is 4 out of 5, but they should work on chicken tikka masala. I didn't find any taste in it. But the quality of food is good. The naan is very plain, they should offer Garlic naan to make the Thaali more tasty. Rice is of good quality they have used. Raita is fresh. Overall I am not disappointed,  although I expected a better Chicken tikka masala which is a basic chicken curry in any Indian place and it shouldn't go wrong.\n\nOverall I appreciate this restaurant team for their efforts to offer Thali at such low price yet quoty food. You don't even get a burger or sandwich from McD  for that price in these inflation days. Also, the girl at front was friendly and did good job.\n\nI wanted to try Chana bathura next time.\n\nThank you."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN0XMLgOx4y_8kqS_FWesvvQNTC3Funx6F9Rev4\u0026fid=0x0:0xf0212ded0051493f""],""When"":""2024-6-13""},{""Name"":""Sathiyaseelan Suhashini"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWGCDhZwAvUF3Q8iMEpEx8TQCvKbwiXzYFJN0uOrenEt7v0wxGX=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Loved the sweets which are delicious.

It was complimented extremely well with the salad and sauce.\n\nI've also heard lots of great things about their sushi, so I can assure you that they hold a high standard for their food. That alone is worth going for!\n\nThe unfortunate downside I was willing to forgive (cause of the food😹) was their lack of service.\n\nIt's a bummer that they don't go out of their way to seat you, provide the menu for you, or refill your drink.

It deserves an 8 out of 10.\n\nOverview: Dana Pani Indian Cuisine stands out as one of our favorite Indian restaurants and a hidden gem in the area. We visited for a quick bite and were thoroughly impressed by the quality and flavor of the dishes.\n\nFood:\n\n•\tAppetizer: We started with a large portion of vegetable pakora. These were excellently prepared, with a perfect fry and a well-balanced seasoning blend. The appetizer sets a promising tone for the meal and merits an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tMain Course: We opted for the Tiffin Thali, a diverse and satisfying selection that included both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, rice, naan, and raita.\n\n•\tPalak Paneer: This dish, a staple of North Indian cuisine, features paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a rich, flavorful spinach-based sauce. The spinach is blanched and pureed to a smooth consistency, then sautéed with onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes, along with a medley of spices. It was expertly prepared and rates an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tChicken Tikka Masala: Known for its vibrant orange color and rich, creamy, spiced tomato-based sauce, this dish did not disappoint. The balance of flavors and the aromatic quality of the sauce were excellent. It earns an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tChana Masala: This dish features chickpeas cooked in a spicy and tangy tomato-onion gravy. It is a staple in Indian cuisine, celebrated for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. While tasty, it lacked the depth of flavor found in the other dishes and receives a 7 out of 10.\n\n•\tButter Chicken: A personal favorite, this dish featured a creamy, luscious sauce with tender, delicious chicken. It stood out as the highlight of the meal and deserves a 9 out of 10.\n\nAmbiance: The ambiance is modest but comfortable. While the space is small, it is adequately maintained and provides a cozy setting for dining.\n\nPrice: The pricing is very affordable, making it an excellent option for those seeking quality Indian cuisine without breaking the bank.\n2/5\n\nVerdict: Dana Pani Indian Cuisine is truly a hidden gem and one of the best Indian restaurants in the area. The variety and quality of the food are outstanding, and the affordability adds to its appeal. For those who enjoy spicy food, it’s worth noting that while the dishes are flavorful, they cater to various spice preferences, offering non-spicy, medium, and very hot options. Overall, it’s a restaurant we will certainly return to and highly recommend."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO5yhzePV_P4zOnZyLnxZOBpAWD7VNYor1BubP0\u0026fid=0x0:0xe029e562e7fb717a""],""When"":""2024-6-27""},{""Name"":""Chris Lochhead"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJuiipc_xz9ET6nJtGoC_1SL7eafro7oB6Q-WiHyZ8PyZyITQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This place is a hidden New Westminster gem.

Finally made it here.  Chinese food can often be quite greasy but this food was not, and I loved that about it.\n\nThis location in New Westminster is the second location of Dragon Bowl. I love how the bowls are customizable. There are options for omnivores, vegetarians and even vegans. You can also get bubble tea drinks here. Dakasi bubble tea was in this space previously but it seems that you can still get their drinks here as all of the cups have the Dakasi name printed on them.\n\nThe people working here were friendly and polite; however, I do think they could have been a bit more helpful when it came to food selection. My bowl of food came with a \""vegetable\"" soup and as they knew that I had ordered a Vegan bowl I would have thought that if the soup contained meat in it, they would inform me of it. It was only when I sat down to drink my soup and saw pieces of meat in it that I realized it was not a meat free vegetable soup. I ended up giving the rest of the soup to my daughter. Also, there was a bean curd product that looked like noodles which I selected for my bowl. This item turned out to be quite spicy. I was able to tolerate the spice level but with any food item that's spicy, I think it would be good for a shop to give the customer some warning about it. My daughter was sharing this bowl with me, and she had more troubles than me with handling the spice level.\n\nAside from the soup and spice blunders, I did enjoy the food here and would most certainly come back again. I chose to go Vegan for this visit but the marinated egg looked very tempting so I may choose to go Vegetarian next time!\n\nService: Could have been better\nParking: Free parking on the side streets\nLocation: 406 6th St., New Westminster"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOhv-p8o0JSSCIY7ZJ61K51RtabMNYKQ8qAzPRr\u0026fid=0x0:0x960f0029ed7dff68""],""When"":""2024-3-28""},{""Name"":""Ads"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVwDyuvQtXP_VygmU1rNXhUJ0mc48E4h1QtDkdEfrlXmuS-mYhL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""谢谢 Xièxiè!!\nWow, phenomenal flavor and super yummy traditional and homemade classic Chinese cuisine at reasonable fare with a plentiful serving.

She gave us a sample of her Mango Mousse. She was thinking of adding it to their already delish menu list and ask us to send her a feedback. I wanted to send her my input on it but I didnt get her contact. Hopefully this will able to reach her? The Mango was so fresh and big chunks was a real bonus, which I am sure people will appreciate because I certainly did! The cake layer was soft and not dry at all, and the buttercream/ganache/creamcheese, not sure what the cream was made of, super delish! I found myself kept on scooping until its was just the empty cup left. It was not too sweet nor bland. A perfect taste of a great dessert.

Then came a couple of times when the Neptune group took over and turned it into this Japanese restaurant.\n\nIt’s located right across the street from the New West skytrain station. There are a handful of free parking spaces available on its private parking lot, otherwise it’s paid street parking or the parkade.\n\nInside is a pretty basic layout with booth seats by the window, tables to the middle and the sushi bar to the inner corner. Very casual setting.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Miso soup (Complimentary). Nice and hot the way I like it, thank you!\n2. Tako wasabi. Fresh and pretty good, probably one of the best price so far for this dish compared to other places.\n3. Kani sunomono. First, it was too sweet (added too much sugar), secondly the amount of crab meat was almost a joke (come on guys, the prepackaged low quality crab meat is cheap), lastly  the crab meat was dry! (Hint: There’s a new supplier has better and whole crab meat chunks, better and same price!)\n4. Soft shell crab. Decent size, lightly battered and seasoned just the way it should!\n5. Oyster motoyaki. It was okay but I would like it more if they were made from fresh oysters on a shell.\n6. Sakura roll. Looked very promising like a blossom in the menu but in reality just another basic roll with no hint of Sakura whatsoever. (It’s called a Sakura roll, add some pink or red to it!!!)\n7. Red tuna, albacore toro, salmon, chopped scallops, tamago, ikura nigiris. The toro was missing that butteriness, the chopped scallops and tamago were okay, ikura was so so, the salmon and red tuna were dry.\n8. Assorted sashimi. I honestly am shocked on how every piece of the sashimis could be so dry and tasteless. It literally seems like the chef dab dry every single piece of sashimi with bounty paper towels.\n\nThe services here were quite accommodating and friendly, at least during my visit here.\n\nAs for the food, I remember it used to be decently okay, maybe different chefs?! It was somewhat disappointing during this visit; some of the ingredients were off, the sashimis and nigiris were quite dry.

Worst thing about this restaurant is that I have to drive out from Vancouver to have it! The chicken nuggets are also super delicious.

They are way too salty or oily but I suppose it suits the North American taste more? Nothing wrong with liking that, they're still good, just not authentic. But the beef noodles at Rong Rong are most definitely the closest noodles to actual beef noodles you'd have in Taiwan. (Disclaimer: I am not Taiwanese but on my last trip to Taiwan I gathered recommendations from many locals and tried a different beef noodle restaurant every single day of the trip).\n\nThat said, personally I think the dining in experience is way better than takeout. The noodles taste much better fresh. There is very limited seating, if I remember correctly there are tables for three groups of 2s, one group of 4, and there's one round table.\n\nThere is no free parking (15 min short term parking, only 3 spots) but I have never had too much difficulties finding paid street parking nearby.

Lack of flavour and a bit too crunchy for a soft shell crab to my liking.\n2. Tako wasabi. Pretty good, not slimy.\n3. Salmon and tuna sashimi. Decent size and fresh but could use a bit of a presentation even though it’s a take out (all sushi places should STOP putting lemon slices near sashimis, they literally cook the outside of whatever fish it touches).\n4. Salmon, hamachi, chopped scallops, tamago, albacore toro nigiris. Fresh but the toros missing that buttery taste.\n5. Spider roll and futomaki. The futomaki was pretty good. The spider roll was a bit off, maybe because the softshell crab was a bit off.\n6. Deep fried poached egg. Surprisingly pretty good, I actually enjoyed it. I could snack on a couple of these.\n7. Asari garlic butter. It was pretty bland even though I do smell the garlics. And what’s with so much broth? It’s like a guppy fish swimming in the ocean.\n8. Beef teriyaki with rice. The rice could be softer and the beef could be less dry and slightly thicker so it wouldn’t be like eating beef jerky with rice.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the order, the restaurant was pretty quiet with one table of customers. A weird little sense of silence especially late at night in New West.\n\nThe service from the server who packaged my order was okay, although could be more welcoming . Maybe cause it has been a long day and it was late.\n\nAs for the food, I was hoping it to be decently okay because I was counting on it to be my late night take out place but they fell short of that… hyaaaa!

Knowing it was busy, I asked the guy before I ordered how long the wait would be and he said it would be quick. This frustrated me even more because had he have told me the approx. wait time, I wouldn't have ordered.\n\nThey really need to either get more waffle makers, prioritize orders, or so something because their system does not work well!\n\nThey didn't really have much of an indoor dining setup. They had chairs and tables but they were all off to the side and the crowd was just using the available seats to wait for their order. It was busy and lots we're waiting; some sitting and others standing. Not sure if the dining setup is different at other times perhaps when it's not as busy...\n\nThe waffles themselves were good. Hot and fresh. Tried the sesame and chocolate. Both were good although I preferred the sesame. One critique about the food is that they didn't distribute the sesame seeds on the waffle evenly. Some bubbles had lots of sesame seeds embedded and others had none.

This response makes me feel that you may have been aware of the mistake. Regardless, I urge you to reconsider how you interact with customers. I have been a loyal customer of your establishment for the past five years, but based on this experience, I will not be returning.\n\nSecond edit:\nRegarding the refund, I want to address the situation where I was directed to call the non-emergency police line without clear reason, as you had walked away from the issue. I subsequently approached another staff member, Jay, who was calm, helpful, and successfully assisted me with the refund. When I reentered the store with the incorrect pizza (which I had not ordered), my intention was to request a replacement. It would have been more effective if you had taken a moment to calmly address the situation, rather than directing me to call the police and walking away."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""adam juhl"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVBEEOJsxcZ-rUNr9xBedlCJ3fEqSRfZeoIJEy1UlgVLzeqhNEM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I've never had this pizza, but it looks delicious.

I am a BBH lover and love trying out this dish at different pho restaurants. I love the flavor and could drink all the soup!

Very generous portion we really enjoyed the meal. I can safely say I will be a regular of this restaurant 😊\n\n------------------------\n\nFirst of all we were also big fans of the previous restaurant. I waited and read reviews from other visitors and finally decided giving it a try.\n\nI knew it's not the same restaurant anymore and not like new owner assumed the same name and took over so of course food should taste different. To be fair, I left myself open minded for my visit. We ordered the house special pho and lemongrass pork and spring roll with rice, and chicken wings for appetizer.\n\nI think the wings might need a little more seasoning in the coating, but the pho and rice were pretty good. I went greedy asked for a large. There was lots of ingredients I couldn't finish! The broth was light yet tasty. Also, I did not feel thirsty after drinking the soup! Those who said it's bland maybe are more used to very strong taste? Spring roll was actually good (though previous restaurant always had the best spring roll in Vancouver theirs were hard to beat!), they used broken rice for their rice, pork was juicy and tender.\n\nServers were pretty friendly (looks like family run), Overall pretty good experience.

My last visit here was all the way back in 2012. Had a quick look at my old food blog and, sure enough, the menu hasn't changed much since then (aside from the prices).\n\nWe ordered the combo platter where you can choose 2 different types of fish. We got the cod and snapper ($21.95) combo which came with chips, coleslaw, a dinner roll and butter. Then we added the 3pc prawns and 2 pc oysters (+$10.75). We also got their signature soup ($6.95).\n\nI forgotten how thick the batter was on their shrimp. A bit too much for my liking.  The oyster batter was thinner. The soup has halibut, bacon, tiny clams, and veggies in a thickish chicken broth. The dinner roll is quite dry and cold but ok when dipped in the soup.\n\nThe fish and chips here is serviceable but mid-level at best. The fish was either cooked a bit too long or wasn't the freshest as parts were a bit dry. Fries were lightly crispy but some also seemed quite limp. I ordered a ginger ale and it came out super flat. I mentioned this to the waitress and she poured another glass which was pretty much the same. Must have been something wrong with their machine so they just gave me a can instead.\n\nThe place was actually fairly busy when we visited. Also noticed a strange odor inside.

The chicken was so tender and flavorful that it melted in my mouth. My only regret was not asking for the extra kick of calamansi and chili. It would have been the perfect finishing touch.\n\nAs a side, I indulged in a heavenly tortang talong. It\nwas a nostalgic taste of home, reminding me of my Nanay's cooking.

The first to be finished was the palabok (I’ve never seen a palabok dish be finished before anything else) then the chicken inasal was definitely next to be devoured. The sauce of the bbq kept the skewers tasty and all the meats were very tender, even though we served dinner a few hours after delivery. I told our guests that when ordering from NK, they are always very consistent in flavours and presentation is beautiful. NK also had great communication with me which I really value from vendors and they delivered within the time agreed upon. I like the fact that orders can be placed by credit card online and way in advance. Saves me the hassle on a busy day. If there’s one thing that I’d suggest, it would be to add a veggie dish (ensaladang talong or something similar to a papaya salad) to accompany the grilled meats.
