a local business not only makes the most amazing food but also goes above and beyond in customer service, you know you’ve hit the jackpot!\nWe stopped at Roy’s on our way from Victoria to Vancouver after a long day of sightseeing. We reached 10 minutes before closing time, they had already closed the kitchen and were winding up for the day. When I told them I had specially come to sample their Bengali cuisine with my family, all the way from the east coast, they opened their kitchen and hearts for us.\nThe food was cooked to perfection. We celebrated my husband’s 50th with his favourite; kosha mangsho ( slow cooked goat curry) which reminded me of home. The flaky laccha parantha was perfect with it. 10/10\nWe had the prawn curry with lime leaves and it was spicy and so so delicious. We washed it down with gur-er rosogolla (cottage cheese balls soaked in a sweet jaggery syrup)and my only regret was that I didn’t pack more to takeaway.\nIt was an outstanding meal, cooked to perfection, authentic Bengali food in every sense. The staff was extremely helpful and made our dining experience at Roy’s one that was really special.\nThank you Roy’s for bringing the Indian hospitality and food to Canada.

The paneer was entirely flavorless - the gravy tasted like dal, which was so weird.\n\nAfter all this, I chalked it up to just picking bad options on the menu.

They were attentive, ensuring that tabs were accurately started for the correct guests and taking the time to remember each guest's name and preferences.

Pairing it with a crisp, chilled Pinot Grigio was an excellent choice, as the wine’s refreshing notes perfectly complemented the dish.\n\nOur server was fantastic—attentive, polite, and genuinely made us feel welcome. It’s always nice to have staff that checks in without being overbearing, and she struck that perfect balance. Service like this really elevates the dining experience.\n\nWhether you’re in a rush or looking for a place to linger, Browns Socialhouse is a great option.

I am firmly of the opinion that for the great cost that it takes to travel out to venues for meals overall (time, travel, fuel, meal, taxes, etc.). So here’s my rating.\n\n* Cost and Value\nCost seems slightly higher than necessary. When I was young it was a quarter for a coffee and that wasn’t that long ago! $4.25 plus tax for a single, no-refill coffee is outrageous. French toast (on this visit) was a decent size and tasty. But still feels about $3 overpriced.\n\n* Customer Service\nThe service here knocks two stars off. Both of my visits the servers were snippy, abrupt and had so little patience that they wouldn’t stand for ten seconds to wait for change or an order to be made. Entirely uncooperative, very surface polite…but eye rolling etc = management needs to immediately give a customer service lesson to most of the staff. The server was totally unwilling to discuss dietary requirements, minor modifications or to check on food allergy concerns. If I was the manager of this place I would have fired the server on the spot. They were all old enough to know better and regardless of the difficulty of the customers they may deal with, in an almost empty place I expected MUCH better decorum.\n\n* Enjoyment and Presentation\nThe food was good, and presented decently. I would say there is a strong disconnect on what Canadian culture currently is, as vegetarian options were few and both the “veggie” soups when I went had meat bases! How disconnected from the food industry trends is the cook? Other than the rude server and a lack of options or cooperation, this rating is below average. Still passable if you need to have a filling meal while nearby."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNglz6VQRc8uX1Ev_WYLtrshL2SZ-GXuvnIuydR\u0026fid=0x0:0xbe1267c3150ee48b""],""When"":""2022-6-16""}]",

Back in the beginning of October, we wanted Italian food for dinner. We also wanted to go somewhere that we had never been to before. A search brought led me to Illuminaté Restorante. We are extremely glad it did! So, a reservation was made.\n\nUpon entering, we immediately found Illuminaté Restorante to be a comfortable environment with a rustic Italian feel. Obviously, it is a popular place too. We can understand why.\n\nOur meal started off with the Grilled Romaine and the Grilled Calamari to share. Both were outstanding! The Roasted Garlic dressing was wonderful on the perfectly grill romaine. The Calamari was a surprising delight. The hints of orange and pickled fennel took this squid to another level. In a world, awesome!\n\nOur pasta mains were next level Italian cuisine. The Pappardelle al Ragu was by far on of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had. The Braised Angus Short Ribs and Mushrooms were in a sauce that was out of this world. As for the Spaghetti and Meatballs, one would think “What a basic dish.” This was far beyond basic. Whatever is in their “Family Recipe” is extremely flavourful and delicious. Best meatballs ever.\n\nOf course there was dessert. We shared the Citrus Crème Brule and the Mini Cannolis. The Lemongrass and Citrus was a great edition to this delicious custard. One cannot go to an Italian restaurant without having Cannolis. The Pistachio and Ricotta filling was superb. These mini cannolis rivals those of Mike’s Pastries of Boston.\n\nAnd then there’s the service. Marie took extremely good care of us. She is very knowledgeable about the menu when we had questions. In chatting with Marie, she told us how much she loves her job and what she does. It shows. It’s always a pleasure to have service like Marie’s when dining out.\n\nSo, would I recommend Illuminaté Restorante? Absolute! This is a gem of a restaurant that you don’t have to travel downtown to. We can’t wait to dine there again."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOXDTu5sqwygeUAS-YGuWvWI20XRqTq1z238hnD\u0026fid=0x0:0x15d7115c41800af7""],""When"":""2024-11-22""},{""Name"":""KAP Magnuson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVuEWJRpclnUBzUp95TdnZT4hJ49cO3TDHBdnPq4gPy3qq4zyA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It was our first time at this restaurant.

When I entered the store, the worker, Manpreet, was acting frazzled on the phone. When she finally looked up she asked how she can assist me, I shared I’m here to pick up an online order, Manpreet then said “okay, it’ll be a moment” and then she continued to loiter behind the counter and pacing back and forth on the phone. Then after she finally got off the phone she started to make, what I assumed, was my order which was 7 minutes after I Manpreet mentioned it would ‘just be a moment’. This was unacceptable as we had 2 young kids waiting in the car and hence why I believe placing an online order would have been a better idea. Manpreet also did not apologize for the late order or the inconvenience this has caused me.

They were among the worst meatballs I've had in years.\n\nThe wings also left us disappointed. We opted for a half-and-half combination of lemon pepper and honey garlic flavors. The lemon pepper wings turned out to be dry, and the taste of the honey garlic wings was unclear.\n\nAs for the soda, we ordered Coke and Sprite. My son mentioned that his Sprite tasted like water, l  believe that the soda lacked sufficient carbon dioxide.\n\nOverall, the experience had its ups and downs, with some dishes meeting our expectations while others fell short."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOC4bKrUklfBCqJ9xhJf3bKbqquKqCLN-eaPQmg\u0026fid=0x0:0x62dbece1fff9c912""],""When"":""2023-7-1""},{""Name"":""Shawn Corkum"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXxtAysqj7F2p6bXglsUmRm5orOep5UPFSzANo7LTK_LKMLPrMwoA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Stopped at Wings for lunch, it was my second time here.

Located adjacent to the food court, this casual eatery presents a range of Japanese-inspired dishes with an emphasis on ramen.\n\nFood\n\nTakoyaki\nMenbow’s takoyaki is a commendable starter. Served warm, the exterior is delicately crispy, while the inside retains a creamy, well-balanced texture. The flavor is satisfying, though not particularly distinctive. A reliable choice for takoyaki enthusiasts.\nRating: 7/10\n\nShoyu Ramen\nThe shoyu ramen delivers a robust, savory broth complemented by tender chashu slices. The portion size is generous, making it a comforting option. While it satisfies on all fronts, it doesn’t venture into memorable territory.\nRating: 7/10\n\nTantan Ramen\nThis tantan ramen impresses with its creamy broth and nutty undertones. The flavors are rich and balanced, though an extra touch of spice could have elevated the dish. It remains a solid pick for those seeking a slight kick.\nRating: 7/10\n\nMini Pork Rice Bowl\nA standout on the menu, the mini pork rice bowl features succulent, well-seasoned pork paired with perfectly cooked rice. Its balance of textures and flavors makes it one of the more satisfying options.\nRating: 8/10\n\nDeep-Fried Gyoza\nCrisp and golden, the deep-fried gyoza is a dependable side dish. The filling is flavorful, though it doesn’t necessarily set itself apart from similar offerings elsewhere.\nRating: 7/10\n\nChicken Karaage\nThe chicken karaage, while adequately crispy, falls short of expectations. The seasoning lacks depth, leaving the dish somewhat underwhelming compared to other options on the menu.\nRating: 6/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nMenbow Ramen boasts a clean and modern interior that feels fresh and inviting. Despite being located in a busy mall, the restaurant offers a pleasant escape with its well-maintained space. The self-service kiosk system is intuitive and efficient, streamlining the ordering process.\nRating: 8/10\n\nService\n\nService is functional, with staff acknowledging customers without any particular warmth or attentiveness. While it meets basic expectations, the experience lacks the personalized touch that can elevate casual dining.\nRating: 7/10\n\nPrice\n\nThe pricing is fair and consistent with the portion sizes and quality of the food. Menbow Ramen offers good value for a quick and satisfying meal within a shopping mall setting.\n\nVerdict\n\nMenbow Ramen Tsawwassen offers a reliable dining experience for mall-goers seeking quality ramen and Japanese-inspired dishes. While it may not deliver standout culinary moments, it excels in convenience, cleanliness, and overall consistency. For shoppers in need of a quick, satisfying bite, Menbow Ramen is a commendable choice."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOdJppCTuFoOyKYEiGh_2mEUaLbU5wKqg1tPAIC\u0026fid=0x0:0x5bc528369b8869b6""],""When"":""2024-11-29""},{""Name"":""Tony Li"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXf8VP49ZjSvgG0JnhT1tc6Tv6OzLL9YEi_yNvwH1rW_K8-7VE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""After seeing a 2.8 rating, I wanted to go back to Menbow Ramen to see if it deserved that rating or not. If you've been to Japan, you would have experienced ordering your food from a kiosk before sitting down in the restaurant. Thumbs up on that, except when you select the daily special, don't assume I want to order a drink. It's almost as though it is included in the price but it is not. Just don't pick anything and add to cart. I selected take out so when the food came, it was nicely packaged in a covered bowl. Thumbs up on the package. No instructions but its easy to figure it out. Just in case youre not sure, ask before you leave the restaurant. Today it was an Asian guy who served me. He was polite. Other times I've come here, it's been a caucasian lady. She was also pleasant. On their soft opening, there were two chefs. Perhaps they were working out the kinks and they weren't the best public facing individuals minding the store. The broth is delicious. Unlike a lot of ramen joints in Tokyo, the broth is not oily. You can drink it without worrying about the fat. They deserve 4 stars for the ramen. Don't order the chicken karaage. I agree, the taste is off. Squeeze some lemon on it or skip it altogether. And come on Tuesdays when extra noodles are free. If you want chicken, order the Tuesday $3.99 box at KFC. Now that's a finger lickin' deal."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNQvTTC8SI-gJTFkY2PqkcxYweO0hmwn1D--qFS\u0026fid=0x0:0x5bc528369b8869b6""],""When"":""2024-12-11""},{""Name"":""James Gonzales"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0unpnU-8mggud0YcgWewTeEH_sT0-3Uzrhx_zm_qDfPS-Nug=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""No more need to go to Vancouver for good ramen places as this has great tasting ramen!

Me and my friend both took two bites and agreed it wasn’t paranoia. When we placed the unfinished bowl to the return shelf the kiosk staff asked how was it, I replied a tad salty, very salty. Then the manager overheard that and told me it was impossible because they didnt add soy sauce, and asked whether WE were the ones that added it ourselves. I said no, we never add sauce prior to tasting it as is, and I never claimed they added specifically soy sauce. Whatever they had in the broth was extremely salty.

Each bite is a burst of flavor, with perfectly spiced fillings wrapped in warm tortillas that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They're served with a creamy dipping sauce that complements the spices beautifully, making it impossible to have just one.\n\nAnd let's talk about the Cheesy Bread – a true indulgence for any cheese lover. The bread is baked to perfection, with a golden, crispy crust and a soft, airy interior. Each piece is generously topped with melted, gooey cheese that stretches delightfully with every bite. It's the kind of comfort food that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nMontana’s has truly mastered the art of creating delicious, hearty food that leaves you craving for your next visit.

Mission accomplished.\n\nI live in Seattle, so I'm a couple of hours away. But if I could, I would return week after week, and perhaps even day after day. Because coming to Connaught Place is like coming home, even if I'm not Indian.\n\nAfter a long day of traveling from Salt Spring Island, we needed a quiet dinner to restore ourselves. I chose Connaught Place from the many positive reviews. We found the unassuming eatery tucked behind an office building and peered in the windows to see it empty. With trepidation, we approached the door just as a young woman was pulling up to pick up take out. I asked her how the food was and without hesitating, her face lit up and she said, \""Oh my god, it's delicious! Plus, it's family owned and I love to support small business.\""\n\nEnough said. We slid into a booth and was greeted by the lovely Satbir. She helped us (Indian-food novices), decide what to order based on our input: samosas, naan and lamb korma. She could tell we needed a little pick-me-up and kindly brought us papadum (a crispy wafer-like bread) with mango chutney.\n\nThe samosas were hot and tasty, however, the star of the table was the lamb korma. With generous chunks of tender lamb in a rich and creamy sauce, it was the stuff my dreams are made of. Accompanied by a hearty serving of rice, it was plenty for my husband and me. Even after we were satisfied, we kept on heaping food on our plate because we didn't want to miss out on one more bite.\n\nWhile chatting with Satbir, we mentioned that it was our anniversary and she surprised us with scoops of mango ice cream! Just the thing to top off a memorable meal. We were definitely happy diners.\n\nThroughout the evening, many people came and went from Connaught Place to pick up their to-go orders. But I suggest dining in the relaxing space because not only is the food superb, but Satbir is a delight, and an integral part of a wonderful experience. Oh, and you might want to order more than one main dish because you'll definitely want leftovers."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNwDP86BmOkutA77Dz0l0WGT6IKziVi7Vh0UKnH\u0026fid=0x0:0x68c8a7d638fd7531""],""When"":""2023-8-2""},{""Name"":""Celestial Producer"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLcwqfWl1gr39vLtzTdQX1KjMjQn0etzAzDHo-cF4Ad1jRuxQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best Fish Pakora ever and butter chicken ever...real spices...been coming here since they opened ...you can taste the love in their food...amazing family....who ever complains has no idea about food with amazing flavor or they get paid by the competition shame on you🤔 😋\nLove you Connaught family xoxo 😘"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Abhinav Jindal"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJM4oZCfhRvIsNadmGhYgIAN02ymUQqZkd-HEyw_g2b22BpSw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We ordered Dal Maharani (Spice level hot) with Naans and Rotis, and it was really amazing.

I couldn't believe it when they told me that they don't use MSG in their food. And they have my favourite food – BBQ chicken, BBQ pork, fried noodles, and of course mixed vegetables. However, we discovered that there is a catch – chopped garlic is as common an ingredient as salt, and there's garlic in everything. But if we wanted to eat a balanced meal with a decent amount of cooked vegetables, that's what's available. We stopped by the mill before heading out to the ferry to grab a bite to eat. I was going to have a simple Chachi's sandwich but would prefer more vegetables, and Bourbon Street Grill is the next stall. But the food was almost not edible because of the amount of salt in the food. I ate less than half and left the rest. We've since gone back again in case there was a different cook. But same thing, the honey mustard chicken was over-spiced and everything was too salty.

The pork katsu was thin, crunchy, but lacked seasoning. The agedashi tofu was bouncy and tasty. The gyoza was disappointing and lacking taste. Maybe we need to try other items. The miso soup was warm and could've been served hotter. Our server was the only one to handle the entire restaurant, which did create some delays for service.

There are also no locations near where we live, since we were shopping here, we decided to try it out. Overall very happy with the food, service and ambience, 100% recommend you visit this location if you are anywhere near the area.\n\nThe interior decor is really nice and welcoming, restaurant seats 30-40 people, lots of seating options from regular tables to couches, booths and one high table. We were greeted by the employee behind the counter. We used the app to place our order and it was a very smooth experience but also could have ordered in-store.\n\nThe burrito was 10/10. The portion was generous, the food was very flavourful and the ingredients looked so fresh. In fact the staff was preparing some meat and vegetables on the grill behind the counter when we came in.\n\nThe bathrooms were clean too and the service from Twinkle was fantastic.\n\nOverall, this location of Mucho Burrito blew our expectations and left us with a very good taste. I hope this location gets a lot more business when customers see the incredible value they offer.\n\nI consider myself a fairly tough critic but the entire experience at Mucho Burrito was a 10/10."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOkNzurAX4BewBCOI3MbxFxEJwZDGRJI3MPXXay\u0026fid=0x0:0x348601124d1e0e1f""],""When"":""2024-6-10""},{""Name"":""Wild Wanderlust Photography"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXYPQeHy2fRvptt6V1NtTq0t9CdOFiP_rQd_Emm8iYNczU9hCDSwA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I just love their monster burritos!

Rings through again and send me back to corporate. Explain the issue again and she goes to transfer me (again). I explain we have done that already. The next thing…... It was as if the phone was set on a table and left. Quiet. But I could faintly hear people in the background. I say “hello?hello?” But nothing. 15 seconds later I’m hung up on. Call back the store. Someone answers and says I need to call back at 6pm to speak to a manager. I call at 6:12pm. Manager isn’t in today, he is at Ladner- call there. So I do. He takes down my number and says he will call at 4pm the following day. Guess what? Doesn’t call.\n\nThese guys just don’t care at all about serving good food or you having a good experience.

Honestly, I think the vast majority of fish and chips are bland and rather sad. However, anything made well can overturn that sweeping generalization. And I am proud to say that of all the fish and chips I've had that Harry's  is worth it. The fish is perfect. I highly recommend the haddock. The batter is thin, crispy, well seasoned. Not too oily. The chips are great. The tartar sauce is excellent.\n\nThe curry sauce was very disappointing. It tastes like some cheap powdered Curry sauce and I feel if they put the same love into it as the rest of the stuff, it would be a knock out. But most importantly, Harry's does what a fish and chips place should do well.... The fish and the chips.  Having eaten fish and chips on white rock, steveston, Granville Island, Melbourne and across numerous other places, the batter is always too thick so it gets soggy quick or overpowers the fish or is thick and soaked with oil and grease or it is just plain underseaoned which often seems to be the case in The Vancouver area. An aversion to seasoning. Harry's gets it right.\n\nIt took almost 40 mins to get food while there were only 4 other tables there so that is a negative and they never checked on us to say that the food was going to take a while.

To be honest, I've always liked the juiciness of the chicken and the professionalism of the service, but this store pleasantly surprised me.\n\n1, When placing the order, the front desk staff press the big mary as the original price without hesitation. He didn't look like a new employee who got the job that day. After I mentioned that today was Monday and the sandwich should be half price, he continued to mumble a reason instead of a simple \""sorry\"" and changed it back to half price. This is the first time in many years that I need to remind the staff what day of the week it is.\n2, I ordered another box of \""made for 2\"". It has always been served in one box before, but today it was packed in several paper trays. Maybe it's not a big deal, but I still need to confirm with the staff \""Is this what I ordered?\"", and the gravy bowl is also covered with gravy. Maybe it's not a big deal, but this is the first time.\n3, Finally, I came to my favorite part of the chicken. The five pieces of chicken were obviously mixed. Two of them were newly made, and the rest were unknown. How should I understand this? Is it leftover from the previous customer? Or is it the same order with different cooking skill? The first time in many years.\n\nSo, long story short, This will be my last time here, maybe some people will confuse\""just because of a mistake?\"", okay, let me tell you, in the past few years, I have enjoyed countless excellent services and delicious chicken in many MB stores in BC, they are still there, why should I come back here again?

After about a minute, I had lost patience and was just about to leave, and she came over to the ordering side and just stood there. Still no acknowledgment. I said hi and proceeded to place my order and the lady just stared at me. I thought perhaps she didn't hear me, so I repeated my order. She just looked at me and said \""No\"". Not understanding what the no meant, Im looking for some details, she just walked away. What a bizarre experience. Lol\nThe following day, we ended up ordering the lemongrass chicken meal. This time it was served by the tall guy who I've seen there since day 1. He was nice enough but the food was really bad. The noodles were overcooked and soggy. The chicken barely warm (instead of keeping directly on the warmer, the chicken was in a bowl on top of the warmer - this is also a food safety issue). Thoroughly disappointed by this location.

The service was fast though, there was no line up and the sandwich was made quickly."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPRAW3iKS3mlsEnZ4dKJkC24ICjE4E1PYyEDv-l\u0026fid=0x0:0xde5d0863713ac02""],""When"":""2022-10-24""},{""Name"":""Anne F"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI22FM57MnL6nTwIy_HLBevmQ1pVvxs8_tROXxFuEZTSVPTyg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The staff working on Friday morning were great.

We were confused too, because we ordered Oreo ice cap and it was a normal ice cap. But, later he confirmed it was our order. But when we went to call out for the wrong order, it's hard to get hold of them, they act so busy when there are hardly 1 customers and they are 6-7 servers.

All the faces were full of disappointment and feel like they don't wanna work. I have been to such busy Tim's where they have 50 orders at a time, still they smile, and treat customers the way they should be treated. At least call for the order when it's ready. Uninterested faces while taking orders, rude looks when someone is calling out for wrong order, will not make your life easy, it will piss off the other person, ruin their mood and endup in a bad review.\n\nAnd when I saw the reviews of this place, no wonders there were a lot of people not happy with the service.

From the moment I walked in, it seemed like the staff were uninterested and inattentive. We waited almost 20 minutes to give our order. my experience with the cashiers left a lot to be desired. There was a old lady on there cash. It was clear that she struggled with basic tasks like reading the order correctly or understanding simple instructions. I had to repeat my order multiple times, and even then, it was still entered wrong.\nWhen I tried to explain the mistake, the cashier seemed confused and unable to fix it without calling over a manager, which slowed down the process even more. The lack of basic communication skills made what should have been a quick and easy transaction incredibly frustrating.she doesn't seems professional as at all.it was almost impossible to get cashier's attention for simple things like water refills she cannot even understand that basic thing.It's alarming that a restaurant would allow such poorly trained or ill-equipped staff to handle customer orders and payments.Customer service starts at the register, and if your cashiers can't handle even that, it really diminishes the overall dining experience. I hope they invest in better training or hiring staff who can provide a smoother and more professional experience.The overall attitude of the staff made the experience uncomfortable and unwelcoming.\nI had heard good things about the food here, but with such poor customer service, I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jada f"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXBMbFjOAN3hgEEo2BAevmyr4y71okWigCdxsj9jXJ-PgQrPXW95A=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""As a former Edo employee I'm pretty sure you are not allowed to deny service to someone claiming you have 0 sushi then proceed to sell the same roll to the person behind me, not sure how you can have no rolls period and then sell them right after you tell me no."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mory M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUPs8avgpY6Oe_Ytsg4rqTPRpKj-6YZ9I59NE5Wd6hmPPMEz98=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""My son tried the kids sushi and he liked the taste so he had to go for the second one😅\n\nHe also liked the kids sugar free apple juice."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNRUu5YD0Fietl_4iXu9MZrvAIKJrmCY2ZgbcE\u0026fid=0x0:0xd7238af858a364f2""],""When"":""2024-3-28""},{""Name"":""Romy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJV8-S3VeeKeT0pn9n2DdxFX14BmtdMp_HhzVdEx3f6OGeOaQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Been here last week, and got myself a chicken teriyaki bento with thin noodles, spring roll and california roll.

We ended up with the Wagyu Smash Blue Burger with garlic parmesan fries, the Caprese Chicken Sandwich, and a standard veggie burger. California Spring Salad on the side was a fantastic addition as well. Quality was really impressive on the Wagyu burger, chicken sandwich was a little bland, and the veggie was above average.\n\nOur server was super friendly, made thoughtful suggestions on the menu, and was attentive. She was great. Only qualms were the small beer selection that evening (they didn't have a few beers available) and the inability to use our gift card (which apparently ceased applicability in February).

The Grinch meal wasn't cheap to begin with. At $16.89, you get a Big Mac combo meal with a pair of socks. When you add it up, its not a deal. You're paying for every item in it including the socks. You can't buy the socks directly but you can buy the toy only that comes with the child's happy meal.\n\nI noted they had a stack of Grinch boxes behind the cashier and yet they did not package my Grinch meal in it. Why tempt me and charge premium?\n\nThe child happy meal was in a regular box with no Grinch advertising at all. Another disappointment. We grabbed our meals and found the napkin dispenser was empty. First time, first McDonald's that supplies were depleted.  When we got home, we noticed we had the shaker bag and dill pickle package but no fries. Blasting mad, I jumped back into my car, drove back to McDonald's and complained. There was no apology. The cashier grabbed some fries and gave it to me.

I ordered the ribs and when I got it, did not look appetizing at all.  It pretty much looked boiled and lighted sauced.  It should have been browned a bit to make it look better.  The wings we ordered were really good that were probably the best dish out of the whole dinner.  The pizzas were decent nothing to special about them.  My daughter loved the worms and dirt dessert.  Boston Pizza has changed their menu and I think they are trying to upgrade their menu.  The pizzas seem to be gearing to the more gourmet side.  The pizza looked good but was lacking flavours.  Not sure if it was the crust or the toppings.  I would rate our meal as average.

Another example was a few weeks ago I ordered a sundae and it only had half the amount of ice cream and fudge as previous. Curbside orders take CRAZY long to be delivered.

dinner at Taverna Gorgona in Ladner with my wife and son, and it was a truly memorable experience.

Our server was attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable about the menu, and eager to ensure our dining experience was perfect. We appreciated their recommendations, which proved to be spot-on.\n\nThe food was the star of the evening. We started with the calamari, which was perfectly crispy and paired with a delightful tzatziki sauce. For mains, my wife had the lamb souvlaki, my son opted for the chicken souvlaki, and I went for the seafood platter. Each dish was cooked to perfection, bursting with fresh flavors and generous portions. The accompanying Greek salad and rice pilaf were delicious and well-balanced.\n\nWe couldn’t resist finishing the meal with baklava, and it was easily one of the best we’ve ever had—crispy, sweet, and not overly heavy.\n\nWhat stood out most was the genuine hospitality and the restaurant’s ability to make you feel at home while enjoying a fine dining experience.

I suspect the wings are par fried or pre cooked and then finished and sauced when ordered.  The reason I suspect this is the wings came out very quickly and there is no way they could have been fried from raw in that time. Anyway the wings, while warm when we got them were a bit overcooked.\nThe Bahn mi sandwich had fresh veggies but the meat (grilled pork) was a bit too grilled for its thickness and was a bit like jerky.  There was very little sauce/mayo and no pate (a usual part of a Bahn mi) so it made for an overall dry sandwich.\nFinally, the Bun Bo Hue was hot, spicy, full of flavour and had very generous amounts of meat and noodle!

It seemed to be curry powder mixed into the actual breading of the chicken with honey drizzled on top after it’s been fried - insanely addictive.  The classic was great in texture and a little plain in flavouring for me but maybe it should be that way since it’s their original. Pieces were of decent size - you can choose between two sizes and we opted for the smaller size which is about $15.  You only get a handful of pieces but Rib \u0026 Chicken charges $25 for their half orders so I guess it makes sense that 5 or 6 pieces is $15.

There were a lot more things i did not like compared to the things i kind of liked.  I can’t recommend the dinner buffet at their full price of $30 per person. The food quality is not good enough to warrant such a price. Out of all the food I tried, the only thing i really liked the cheesecake at the dessert bar. The buffet is a decent choice for dinner if you happen to get your hands on a coupon like the $10 discount or the buy one get one free deal they give out from time to time.\n\nAs for the soups, the coconut curry soup was too watery and didn’t taste like anything. I couldn't finish it.\n\nAs for the salads, I took some coleslaw. It tasted alright. I only took it so my meal would be more balanced with veggies.\n\nAs for desserts, the cheesecake was very good. It wasn’t overly sweet which is good.  I noticed it was taken very quickly from other customers at the buffet but it was replenished quick by staff.\nThe chocolate cake bar slices were too sweet. It was sickly sweet. It had caramel drizzle on top of double chocolate breading and icing. Didn’t like it.\nI was disappointed that some dessert menu items were not at the buffet table. Under feature desserts, on the menu displayed at the front of the register, it says jello was included but there were none. There were no cookies either. I’m not sure why was it listed when it wasn’t included.\n\nAs for the mains, the pot roast with gravy didn’t have enough gravy. It was too dry for my liking. I couldn’t eat a lot of it because there was too much fat. The meat portions that I tasted was just OK.\nthe cheese mashed potatoes were very plain. they were bits of melted cheddar cheese with bits of potato skin inside. Worst part was that there was no gravy included. Who eats mashed potatoes without gravy?\nI kinda liked the spring rolls. They were on the salty side but they still tasted alright.\nThe fish with garlic butter sauce was alright. The garlic butter sauce barely added any flavor though. It really needs to be seasoned for it taste very good.\nThe ravioli pasta was alright. It could use a little more sauce though. You really need to season it first for it to taste any good.\nThe rest of the food, such as the chicken wings and the veggie stir fry, didn’t interest me.\n\nDrink selections were plentiful. The soda machine was a coca cola freestyle with many types of pop to choose from. My root beer soda tasted great. They also have coffee, hot chocolate, and juice. The apple juice and hot chocolate drinks were good quality.\n\nThe staff were friendly and fast. At opening time, there was a line at the register and the attendant was quick at taking payments to get the line moving. The servers were quick in taking any used plates at the table. When food was getting low at the buffet, the cooks were fast at replacing them. Tables were clean quickly by the staff after each use.\n\nThe place was only maybe 30-40% full at most during my visit. It was pretty quiet and you could get your food at the buffet table with barely any wait."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNP9xdfe6lIaHXFbIQqnIVAMTRH5ciiMGWo-ocz\u0026fid=0x0:0x5a345b8bacadba47""],""When"":""2024-5-13""},{""Name"":""Willy Lien"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVjtYKchlA79TYXKTZwGGIIf_Z56Q8GUi7XQwp6JJc1BOg8sP9a=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We came around 7pm for the Saturday Prime Rib special and were seated within 10 minutes.

My gut said to just leave at this point but I really wanted to try the burgers. I wish I could say it was delicious but it wasn’t at all. Very dry and salty, I was disappointed. I might try a different location though, just to give it another chance. Maybe the next restaurant will have a front of house employee who actually wants to represent the business with a positive attitude.

It has a cozy atmosphere, simple, with options that range all the way from breakfast, to pizza, burgers and salads. The girl who was our server was very nice, but she didn't know too much about the menu and so couldn't answer our questions. We ordered a burger to share and a capresse salad. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The burger was ok, nothing extraordinary, but I felt that it lacked flavour. The capresse salad was NOT a capresse salad (see photo). We were served a salad that consisted of mixed greens, principally lettuce, with a lemon on top and a single slice of tomato and 2 mini mozzarella balls at the very bottom. I was so confused by this that I assumed there must've been a mistake and asked our server to double check with the kitchen, she responded that that was their capresse salad and left. It is criminal to call this a capresse salad, and if they don't know how to make one then don't put it on the menu because it will lead to disappointed customers.\nMaybe we'll give their pizzas another chance in the future, but let's just say that the first experience in this place wasn't a great one."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP_gzWLwz0vCYM_15hbkQgsr02T5OplSW3-d1Nm\u0026fid=0x0:0xc0f5845d941c9b55""],""When"":""2023-9-14""},{""Name"":""Raeburn MacDougall"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVIoXHoCNiCsL0dOjQhl4dr7HXmy8LsAXROqZKdAcT-ThcE0fCn=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I was walking by and saw their happy hour sign...good price for an app and a beer instead of fast food joint...I ordered poutine and breaded shrimp...it was awesome and just enough...service was great.

Other people in the group got the shrimp and scallops and the fettuccine Alfredo.   Everything was really good and fairly priced.   The wait staff was very nice and professional.   I would definitely come back here!    The venue is really pretty too.  Large windows overlooking a green outdoor area right next to the water, upscale feel.  I heard they were having staffing issues and the restaurant was even closed on Monday 3/27 because of it.   If you’re in the area, consider trying them out!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMcEFeve31e56ykDHd2d4XLS-qrbh9QaLZLMgYC\u0026fid=0x0:0xd17899d0871a4371""],""When"":""2023-3-29""},{""Name"":""Christiane Highfill"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVkL2Y25q_WX-YUSDngQ1N-bLeSeHEamVkM22TWe0By1iSIm40d=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""This was my first sit-down meal experience at this restaurant. We were seated right away and quickly given water, however, it took a while before our server came to get our drink orders. After receiving our drinks, it took a while before we got our order taken. The restaurant was not busy, so I didn't understand the long wait periods.\n\nIt was a Friday during Lent, so I ordered the grilled salmon with the sweet chili sauce on the side, along with the clam chowder.  As an appetizer, we ordered the grilled artichoke to start. The artichoke was a good size and prepared well.  It was tender and you could taste the smokiness of the grill. Absolutley delicious!  The clam chowder was like wallpaper paste. It was thick and gloppy; not very good. The salmon was nothing spectacular. It was a tail portion, grilled all the way through (I prefer mine just slightly underdone), served over a bed of rice pilaf with broccolini.  Overall, the meal was good, but a bit overpriced for what we got. If they ever do the prime rib buffet again, I would give them another try."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO-o08iYkUee25Ud7Z8vAxT0Ypi1R5hAYdU8m7n\u0026fid=0x0:0xd17899d0871a4371""],""When"":""2019-4-8""},{""Name"":""Goldie Locks"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLRQ-0ubpz498cNLstU3ZcQjwt5EWawg_R4zl6LUKzOZM_6zw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""Food is OK.

The irresistible Cuddle burger has managed to capture the hearts of many, including mine. The unbeatable combination of delectable flavor and affordable pricing make it a standout choice!\n\nA crucial aspect not to be forgotten is the cafe's commendable work within the community. Functioning as a social enterprise, DICED invests in shaping the future of young adults in the culinary field. Every delicious meal served is a testament to their commitment towards empowerment and opportunity.\n\nTo top it off, we found free street parking just one block away, saving us the usual parking hassle.

Eventually after 20 minutes waiting, we made contact with the manager who apparently sent a confirmation text to a wrong number so we never received instructions on how to enter the property and get to our room. She was also very rude to my fiancé after she pronounced her name incorrectly. After waiting another 20 minutes for the code to get in the room we decided to go to another hotel that we could actually get access to. Would not recommend staying here if you have an event to go to seeing as this circus almost resulted in us being late to the wedding. There are much better hotels in Elk Grove for about the same price. Hopefully, the manager will do the right thing and refund us the money that we are owed for a room we did not use.\n\nFollow up with the manager, they will not be dropping the charge.

I want to be clear, the food was very good, hot and fresh, so none of the rest of this review concerns the food quality.\nAs stated I have been a guest at Niagara a number of times over the past 20 years, tonight myself and my friend were treat as an after thought.  It started upon our arrival, we had made a reservation only to be made to feel like we were imposing.  The table we were taken to had been set for 4 but \""the people had not arrived so we could have the table.\""  We knew what we were having and ordered immediately (we were sharing a medium pizza and a baked lasagna). Neither of us want anything other than water, I guess that was our first mistake not ordering alcohol. Our pizza arrived in the appropriate amount of time but no lasagna, we ended up having to ask and then we had to wait for the garlic bread.  At no time did someone come by to ask how our meals were, but we noted that the large parties were being fawned over by 3 or 4 service staff, not professional at all.\nI was not happy.  We were not offered desert or coffee, instead we were brought take away containers and 2 candies were DROPPED on the table and were asked \""one cheque or 2?\"". As the fellow walked away my friend commented that a cup of coffee would be nice.  When the fellow came back with the cheques my friend asked politely for a cup of coffee, he never apologized that we had not been asked.....just walked away.  And to note all our dirty dishes were still on the table!  He came back with coffee and the cheques.  After 10 minutes another fellow walked by and said \"" oh you want to pay?\"" Another 10 minutes and we had to request to pay, at that time I commented that I was having the worst experience and was not happy.  The waitress, nor anyone else asked why.....finally we paid.  My tip reflected my disappointment.\n\nIn this day and age when restaurants have an expectation of a minimum of 18% Gratuities the management  better be ensuring that the 18% is deserved.  I refuse to pay for poor guest services. I work and have worked in customer facing businesses for years, sometimes for minimum wage and I do not receive tips other than how to do my job better.  I pick and choose carefully the restaurants I want to spend my money at, tonight's experience has given me reason to take a restaurant off my list.

The experience is enhanced if you go with friends and dress up really nice.\n\nMy cousin was pounding down the mimosas. I love pasta, and this pasta was one of the best I ever had.

Bob's is one of my favorite places to eat. Don't miss out for breakfast and Lunch. It's also very dog friendly and has boat access. Its often brimming with a whole bunch of people, animals included. Birds, dogs, sometimes even the stray cat will survey the area.

I am also grateful for the non-metal chairs!\nIt was 27°. We've just been cooling in the forests of the beautiful UBC Botanical Garden and not quite ready to drive back to the city. Westward Ho at the UBC Golf Course came up on my Google search for brunch. Their patio picture was the deciding factor. Since it was nearly Happy Hour, the pub wasn't crowded and we were able to get a table in the impressively big patio. Not sure if it would be equally impressive had it been a really sunny day. We'd have to check that out another time. On this cloud day, the patio was very bright – almost to the point where I have to put on my sun glasses.\nAs for the food, we had a hard time choosing: fresh fish and chips, fish sandwich, Beyond Beef burger, all day breakfast, etc. I ordered a Club House with multigrain yam fries, my companion ordered fresh Cod and Chips. The bread in my Club House was dried out, the sandwich did not look as scrumptious as the one with sour dough presented to the table next to us. My sandwich was too 'orderly', the chicken did not spill out of the sandwich like the one I saw earlier. I enjoyed the cod fish though – very fresh and not over battered. So, I guess I ordered the wrong thing! I liked the choice of using vinegar on coleslaw instead of mayo. A decent size coleslaw for a more balanced meal. MSG? For a few hours afterwards, I was very thirsty, but did not get the usual sickly feeling from eating MSG. So, not sure what was in the food that caused my tongue to feel so dry."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNjr8zNCvHQWWPDvIvCsF-m8vfK6OTg8xyORYzH\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2021-8-2""},{""Name"":""Azi Jahan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVoCqSGFWxXVxJxNnyUrYmJjWJKEtREeG-G0RXpmBRv8kbELxEL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""For gulf lovers for sure, it's a well-known place.\n\nBeautiful location and view🤌🏻\nDelicious brunch\nSo kind and supportive staff\n\nIt's a peaceful weekend brunch location if you are looking for a calm weekend's brunch🤩"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP4NKPC_4N4_VYCzznfOGLy34Q4VWIecJtPF0BY\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2022-7-29""},{""Name"":""Paul Rogers"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI-2DEuMMhV7vJRExrjz5OPFG99Ya8EpWqhlLnkXnZqRJpDqw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""My family went here with a few other people for dinner.

Friends got the croquette and udon dishes that had undercooked rice and just a pile of raw cabbage as a \""salad\"", stale kimchi and noodles with no flavour.\nTLDR: DO NOT be fooled by the cheap deals because they are too good to be true and you can get much better food for a similar price.

While the serving was large, the fish tasted like old, burnt, cooking oil. While some like crispy batter, this one was well beyond crispy. You had to battle through it with firm stabs of the provided wooden fork. If the word ‘fish’ had not been on the menu I would not have known what that white stuff inside the batter was. Zero taste.

Unfortunately, the policies have changed and a beverage and gratuity is added, very fair, since I was told that some didn't tip, so the policy changed from this week. From this visit, the sauce amount has decreased, and the pasta has gone from al dente to harder, basically raw pasta.\n\nThe first plate of pasta was almost perfectly al dente but still slightly under what I preferred, and was still a treat to enjoy.  After the first plate, I had asked if the pasta could be made softer for the next.  They said that it would not be possible since the pasta is par-cooked.  However, for the next 2 plates, the pasta got harder and harder until I tasted flour and I decided to cut into one.  Well, it was raw inside (photo included).  At this point after 2.5 plates of hard pasta, I didn't feel like asking for it to be remade since they told me before that it wasn't possible.\n\nOverall, the food experience was marginally unacceptable after the first plate. The service was good and the sports bar atmosphere was excellent.   I recommend the rigatoni alla vodka sauce for the all access pasta since it tastes the best, pesto the second.\n\nAfter the complaint, I was told there had been a miscommunication that the pasta couldn't be cooked longer, and the drink cost was taken off as a result."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMb5h3FMgcqIKIxfIJ4PYZyyEEGjALlZXy1MfK1\u0026fid=0x0:0xfbcd82c95f6df084""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""Simon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWq3mMD7x0QRiQPROCB5BEqtJbykKAfvm5IFcPhyVt8QiitDIxq=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I got introduced to this place by a foodie influencer  (Howie) and got to enjoy a lot of their food.

If you ask for any kind of hot sauce, they will charge you $1.50 - SO BE CAREFUL! The Steak  Sandwich was *absolutely* delicious! The taste from the AAA medium-rare flat iron Steak with the  goat cheese and bbq sauce had such a really nice, umami flavour and mouth feel. It was just so delicious!\n\nI also ordered a Nashville Chicken Sando. No pictures taken as the first bite literally made me devour it on the spot! Will definitely come back again to take a photo.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Sports  Ilustrated Clubhouse.

I wouldn't go here as a night out, but at the right times, it's a chill hang. The atmosphere varies wildly depending on the day. On some nights it's louder and is in line with what you'd expect a university bar to be like, and sometimes it's very relaxed, and you can even find some people using it as a study spot (not something I would consider or really recommend, but you do you as long as it's not busy and no one needs the table). Sometimes it's somewhere in between or a weird mix of both. It's not always predictable, but I've found that to hit the quieter days that I prefer, early evening during exam season at school is best, and summer in general are chiller than the main academic year.\nThe food is good, often surprisingly good. The menu items are well thought-out and tasty, and nicely presented. It's not a veg-centric establishment but there's lots of choice for vegans! Off the current menu, I've had the Power Punch Salad, the Vegan Pulled Jackfruit, the Vegan Burger, Vegan Chick'n Caesar Wrap, and the Tempeh Teriyaki. I wasn't particularly impressed by the Caesar wrap - it wasn't awful, I just didn't feel like it was worth $19.5, but everything else was a delight. I'm glad their vegan burger is a (seemingly) housemade, minimally processed black bean patty instead of beyond meat or similar! I usually won't order a salad as my meal, but the Power Punch is substantial! The side salad that comes with the sandwich orders is actually pretty nice too.\nThey make good cocktails and have a long list of local draft beers on tap which I haven't really had a chance to dip into, but I got the \""Green Bird\"" for fun on St. Patrick's Day, which is just a version of their house \""T-Bird\"" lager that's been coloured green (maybe naturally, judging by the grassy notes I got from it, but I don't know for sure). It was actually a good lager though!\nSometimes the staff is nice enough, sometimes I get the vibe that they're too cool to be serving me or something, but because the only interactions you have with them are when you order and pay at the bar and when they bring your food out, an unenthusiastic bartender doesn't ruin the whole experience. Because of this service style, you can expect to be in and out of here faster than you would at a full table service restaurant, but it's not fast food, so dishes still take as much time to prep as they would at a \""regular\"" sit-down place. It's also pricier than typical counter service food, but very reasonably priced compared to off-campus restaurants that serve food of this quality, and there's no obligation to tip 20%. To me, the service model, fair prices, and high quality are a combination of the best elements of counter service and full service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQwEdJ88aXsSlarpRs-9jcRwBTBo0B-hIa3KfE\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b84d3debc8f1cec""],""When"":""2021-4-19""},{""Name"":""Steve Morgan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmgrmzSyB3CC_qWamR3pXmaZna6-RxfqDluiFzTGNrypDReGc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very large service area.

Like the type of attitude you would think takes more effort than being nice.

The other reasons include that there just isn't that much choice on campus and the food is basic but decent here. The view is nice if you're out on the patio. And there's a lot of space. It's very sad that the sit-down nice restaurant didn't make it because that's exactly what the area needs. They just didn't promote it and since this is the top floor, no one discovers this space by walking by. The service at the Gallery when it was in the old sub was never this sad.

It’s simple, pesto with chicken and mushrooms but it is a joy to eat.\n\nThe pizza is quite fast, cooked in around 10 minutes, and there are plenty of seating as well.\n\nI tried the pasta once when it first came out… and it was basically just reheated in a shoddy take-out container. Incredibly disappointing compared to the pizzas.\n\nThe mini caprese salad has the best sauce I’ve ever eaten, so even if the price is a bit steep, worth it imo.\n\nAnyways, please visit!

However they did their best to give us a deal anyways, so we left a tip as much as we could.\n\nThe pizza was tasty, I would personally recommend the ham and pineapple! The others were great too but not as traditional in taste as they were a little more complicated in ingredients.

To my understanding, Dan took ownership fairly recently so I wouldn’t bother reading reviews from 3 years ago and beyond as they aren’t accurate. I would highly recommend this park to anyone in the area long term, short term, or extended stay."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Sitting varies from cafe tables, to Howarts style long tables or high-chair tables found in coffee shops. The food-serving area of the dinning hall is immediately at the place where you pay so you can line up to get your food. To avoid the line at the main entrance of the dinning hall, you can go to the back to pay as well.\n\nThe food here is okay. This is not a high-end restaurant. The food may not be for everyone. Also, there's a self serve ice cream machine, yogurt and salad bar. There are coffee machines and juice dispensers. There are plently of fruits, snacks and bread. At night, the pizza kitchen opens. Food is served in small to medium portion which is perfect for those who do not eat as much or want to try multple things. Chefs are polite and kind and will be willing to give you a bit of extra food if you ask.\n\nThere is no washroom in the dinning hall. You will have to leave the dinning hall and lose your ability to come back to use the washroom.\n\nIf you come here during regular meal times, expect there to be lots of students. If you come during 8:30am, 9:30 am or any time when class is in session, there are not as many people. Menu of the dinning hall can be found at both front and rear entrance.

again May 2023:\nKids treated us to a Mother’s Day lunch and food, portions and service were very good. We ordered vegan as well as non-vegan entrees (see pics).\nOnly observation to note is that peanut sauce for the salad rolls wasn’t very peanuty flavoured.\nBased on today’s meal, I am bumping my rating up to 4.5.\n\nUpdate Jan 2023 **bumping rating from 1 star to 3.5: Gave this long time ND local Vietnamese Restaurant another go after an ownership change last year.\n\nOne of the owners was behind the counter tonight, very friendly and his partner Leslie, in the kitchen owns a Vanc. restaurant.\n\nOur server was pleasant, albeit some confusion with our order, also due to our unfamiliarity with the menu.\n\nWe ordered the House Special Phò (L) $16.99, Deep fried Spring Rolls (2 to an order, $2.50 ea), Assorted Seafood Wonton and BBQ Pork with Noodles (S) $16.99, Deep Fried Rice Paper Spring Roll $4.50 and a Lemongrass Bahn Mi $8.75 to-go.\n\nThe soups were hot (as they should be), the DF Rice Paper Roll was greasy tasting and I didn’t care for it but everything else was good.\n\nMake sure you ask for the chili oil, it’s bomb and a tasty condiment with soup and noodles.\n\nMy previous bad experiences were with dayshift employees so I hope the new management has corrected that.\n\nUpdate Jan 2022: Went with friends for lunch to see if the poor service from hired staff had changed at all. Unfortunately it had not, food is plunked on the corner of the table without any acknowledgement. Nobody came back to check on tea/water refills. Requested the bill and same. Food was ok but the service leaves a bad taste in the mouth and doesn’t warrant a return IMO. Doesn’t seem to affect the local customer loyalty though as it’s been this way for years.\nDemoting to 1 star.\n\nGot take out beef noodle bowl (Phō)- large #6 well done brisket and skirt flank-$10.99. Soup was very hot but not as flavourful as Phō99 which is our go-to, but closed. Comes with generous portion of beef and the usual sprouts, cilanto, lime, basil, jalapeño and hoisin sauce.\nHadn’t been for couple years, while the owners are very nice, friendly people, the servers have not always been very attentive (to the point of being rude) in the past.\nThe food has always been quite good though.\nLocated in a strip mall with a variety of businesses and ample parking."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOnZ3Ufs7YsPQXmcMlvLnP0b-99yAaE24QWZ-s\u0026fid=0x0:0x80f8ec4ed8554885""],""When"":""2022-2-22""},{""Name"":""Ronald Retandy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKiVTWQFKjqXe4UnsBFRIZ7GxF9tGrva9JzQ7uYayyA9RXk6w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Been going here for more than 20 years, I heard it was operating under a new owner last year.

My wife and I each had different lamb entrees, which come from New Zealand. There was a saltiness to the meat, but it only enhanced the flavour rather than another it. The potatoes were infused with some sort of lemony zest, while topped with some sort of mustard that wasn't overpowering, still allowing for the potato to be enjoyed, rather than covering it up completely. And the rice wasn't a filler, but rather something I couldn't bear to miss a single grain, devouring the entire platter. Oh yeah, did I mention the salad? The sour and the freshness of the olive oil was so refreshing, balancing the flavours from the savoury bits.\n\nThe portions were sizeable. Thank goodness I forgot to eat lunch that day. The service was limited, as it's a small mom and pop type of shop. But the place was full on a Tuesday night, along with take out in what looked like a 2 person operation. And even then, the food didn't take long to come out.\n\nSo thoroughly impressed by this hidden gem in Delta!

From the moment we stepped inside, we were welcomed by a cozy, inviting atmosphere. But what really made our evening special was the incredible service we received from our server, Jas.\n\nJas was simply wonderful. She greeted us with the kind of smile that makes you feel right at home. Even though she was taking care of several tables and handling all sorts of requests, she never missed a beat. It was clear she’s incredibly hardworking, yet she made it all look effortless.\n\nOne thing that really stood out was how much Jas knew about the menu. She didn’t just take our order; she helped us choose, offering suggestions that perfectly matched what we were in the mood for. Whether it was deciding on the best appetizers, entrées, or the perfect drink, Jas had great recommendations for everything. Her knowledge of the cocktails, whiskey, and bourbon options was impressive, and her suggestions made our meal even more enjoyable.\n\nAnd speaking of the food—it was fantastic. Tasty Indian Bistro really lives up to its name. Every dish was packed with flavor and beautifully presented. You could tell the chefs put a lot of care into each plate, and it made the whole experience even better.\n\nBut honestly, it was Jas who made the night memorable. She was so friendly and attentive, making us feel like we were her top priority, even though we knew she had plenty of other tables to look after. It’s rare to find someone who’s not only great at their job but does it with such genuine warmth.\n\nAll in all, our dinner at Tasty Indian Bistro was a great experience.

The service could be a bit better.  For example, the waitress took away the bucket that had our utensils and paper napkins to refill but didn't bring it back.  Another situation was when our water jug was empty but none of the waitresses (3 of them) just stood around by the bar and didn't offer to help refill it.\n\nNow to the food ... my family ordered the Chicken 65 Semi-Dry Appetizer, Veg Hakka Noodles, Roti, Parantha, and Hyderabad Goat Dum Biryani.\n\nThe Chicken 65 was ordered non-spicy but it came with a punch.  It was super tasty with the spices and spicyness so luckily we ordered the noodles, roti and parantha to help offset it.  Noodles were delicious however the roti and parantha was just alright.  the star of the meal was the biryani.  It was our first time  trying Hyderabad biryani and it didn't disappoint.  The goat was very flavourful and spicy (even though we asked for non-spicy) so luckily the Raita helped cool the spicy level down.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this restaurant.

The dessert section featured many traditional Indian sweets, which were a bit too sweet for my taste, but I appreciated the option to enjoy ice cream and cake as well.\n\nThe ambiance makes it ideal for family gatherings or company parties.

Medhu vada and podi idli were fresh and tasty appetizers as always. Mixed veg parotta, pav bhaji, and tomato onion chilli uthappam are reliable dishes for adults and have been consistently good. Kids got chocolate dosas, essentially ghee dosa with Nutella spread inside. This does not come with sambar and chutney on the side for some strange reason, previously it used to. Kids didn’t seem to be bothered.  Kids had Shirley temple, adults had mango lassi and filter coffee, both were good. Food is not very expensive in relative terms. $116 with taxes and gratuity, the latter is included in the bill. Shruti was warm, friendly and quick to serve.  Overall good experience.

Originally we were seated at a table for two that was quite dark because of the lack of lighting in the area, so I had requested to our server if we could move to a brighter table behind us which she granted. The main reason for this is because I am not of a fan of eating in the dark, and as a food critic/reviewer, I like to see what I am eating clearly so I can provide better feedback.\n\nWe ordered the following for two people:\n* Tikka 3 Ways\n* Bhatti ki Macchi\n* Garlic Naan\n* Missi Rotti\n* Puran Singh Da Tariwala Murgh\n* Dum murgh biryani\n* Falooda Kulfi\n\nI ordered the tikka 3 ways for my appetizer and it was really good! I love that it was done 3 ways so I can taste which one I like the most...the spicy one was my favorite. The cook on the chicken was perfect and not dry.\n\nFor our mains we got the chef's special Puran Singh Da Tariwala Murgh and Chicken Biryani. For my bread I ordered the garlic naan and my Indian buddy ordered the missi rotti. Everything tasted delicious! The gravy was rich, savory, with a bit of spice and the chicken biryani was piping hot and cooked perfectly! 👌\n\nThe garlic naan was soft, flaky and fresh! The texture was really good and perfect for dipping into the curry. The only con my Indian buddy said was the missi rotti was slightly overcooked.\n\nOverall though the appetizers and mains were delicious.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the Falooda Kulfi and all I have to say is...WOW! The ice cream dessert was bursting with Indian flavours...I felt like I teleported to India when I ate a spoon full of this delicious creamy dessert. This was definitely the star of the meal tonight! I am not a huge dessert guy - but this one I truly enjoyed...I also like that it wasn't overly sweet. 🍨🍧\n\nThe service here was excellent. Our server refilled our waters regularly and even educated me with some of the food I was ordering and eating. She also made sure we were getting new plates, silverware and napkins for each course. 👍\n\nInterior and seating was also good. The table is a nice height and the chairs are padded. The only con is that some of the tables here are placed in darker areas of the restaurant...I guess it's fine if you prefer candle light dinners, but in my opinion there should be a bit more lighting that stretches across the wall where the tables are since they are further away from the glass windows and get blocked out by the higher booth seating which makes those areas feel less important.\n\nOverall though, I enjoyed eating here and plan to eat here again to try their other menu items. I am a big fan of Indian food since I grew up in Surrey, so it's nice to be able to treat myself with some indian fine dining once in a while. 🙂"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMH7Apd1e8CNCeuPqPQ0X62CSoitNmB2nZ6-8Eu\u0026fid=0x0:0x59e2c461f803f0ec""],""When"":""2024-9-1""},{""Name"":""Gunjan N"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKnGgkA1elJAwarcjcQNB0nZVdXLX3uwLu0NnIClSVktMj-5Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Being an avid follower of Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, this place did not live up to its chef's mark.

The first dish  tandoori  lamb had hair in it ( look in picture  below).   The manager  Amrut, was  very apologetic  and saw personally  to all the main courses , making sure we do not find any more hair.  The dessert was on the house and repeat order of the tandoori lamb at no charge to take  home as a sorry.  Taste wise, the batter  used for prawns was too salty. Other dishes were very tasty. It was a let down  for me as I was expecting  better than what  I got at Sanjeev Kapoor  restaurant.   The ambiance  was dull, the place was empty, and the food presentation  was very mediocre. Not the Sanjeev Kapoor  flair that I expected.

Instead of addressing the situation directly, the manager sent three different staff members to pacify us, but he never made an appearance to clarify or apologize for the mishap. This lack of accountability and honesty only added to our frustration. They did not offer any solutions. The first staff member tried to offer us another dish, but that person didn't return.

However, there is a concerning issue with their billing practices.\n\nWhen paying by card, they round off the total to the nearest dollar, which resulted in us being charged 2 cents extra. While this might seem negligible, it adds up significantly across all their transactions. There’s absolutely no reason to round off if the payment is not in cash. If they want to simplify pricing, they could increase menu prices by a cent or charge the exact amount for card payments.\n\nThis practice feels unfair and unnecessary, especially when it’s repeated for every customer and transaction.

I finally got the chance and I'm not disappointed. Came here at 4pm on a Wednesday and got the AYCE Dinner menu.\n\nI don't get why other reviewers had a bad impression about this place, but I didn't see anything that was a major concern. On the contrary, it's one of the better AYCE sushi places I've been too. Sure the sushi might seemed like it had more rice to them (not all rolls, but some), but this is a AYCE place. You won't find a AYCE/Buffet that doesn't add extra starch or whatnot to bulk up the food. The sashimi is limited to 20 pieces per person and a bit smaller then the usual gigantic pieces and the negiri is definitely half the size of a regular piece you'd find anywhere else; the fish/topping they don't skimp on either. The tempura is crispy/crunchy, the prawns are regular sized and the yam are half pieces. The gyoza was nicely crispy as well. Personally, I would get the chicken teriyaki. I was hoping for a more crispy skin, but it fell flat when it arrived to the table; it could've been the sauce though, but the chicken did seem a little dry/tough.\n\nWhen I think of this place now, I think of sensible/petite pieces. Which is great because it gives you a chance to try other things on the menu. The service was quick and the servers are attentive. The best thing is they don't even skimp on your food.

in Delta but was always known to our family as awesome pizza with amazing crust which is very hard to find around here. We’ve been coming back to this joint for many many years now however, tonight we were extremely disappointed to the upmost the toppings were not fresh and the shrimp was freezer burnt if you look in the pictures, it’s very noticeable, I didn’t want to risk my children getting sick so I threw out their pieces and the remaining. When in doubt throw it out, I will always stick by that nothing is worth getting Yourself or your family sick. I just don’t understand how this went unnoticed at a restaurant and in this time, and we spent so much to having food ordered in is such a luxury that not many of us can afford to have this experience to the upmost disappointment. I really hope you guys check the freshness of your food more often, if this is not corrected in a timely manner, I do not think my family will be doing business with this establishment again ."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM3GhZkMTiGP9xhciKT1ADL1-OPigNgKPiuw2Fl\u0026fid=0x0:0x629afbf3037977b3""],""When"":""2024-4-5""},{""Name"":""Damanjot Kaur"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK3Byp7mXm4JHjz3HPnNEZRRHe8TVRCpk5fZd5i4qFb4dnECw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We ordered 2 large tandoori chicken pizzas.

From the moment you step inside, the warm and inviting atmosphere sets the tone for a memorable dining experience. The food is nothing short of spectacular, with each dish offering a distinct and delicious taste.\n\nThe tastiest Karahi I have had anywhere in Canada. Really tasty. Unbelievable!\n\nThe fries at Barney's Karahiwala are another highlight. Often overlooked at many restaurants, the fries here were exceptional—crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, making them the perfect accompaniment to the meal. They were a delightful surprise and complemented the spicier dishes perfectly.\n\nAlso I want to say that the staff here works extra hard. Female staff bringing food upstairs again and again from the kitchen downstairs. I don’t know their names. My guess is the owner is Arshad seemed like a very humble and nice guy. Please thank your staff for us and keep them happy. Hard working people.\n\nThe Karahi, the restaurant’s namesake dish, truly lived up to expectations. It was bursting with robust flavors, featuring tender meat cooked in a rich, spicy gravy. The complexity of the spices created a harmonious blend that was both comforting and exciting to the taste buds. Each bite was a testament to the chef's expertise and the use of high-quality ingredients.\n\nA special mention goes to the owner, who was incredibly friendly and hospitable.\n\nThe Chana Masala, was unfortunately very bland, I talked to the owner he said that was intentional and offered to make it with spice and tarka next time. He personally checked in to ensure everything was to our liking and even promised to make a spicier version of the Chana Masala for us on our next visit. This personal touch added to the overall positive experience, making us feel valued and welcomed.\n\nIn conclusion, Barney's Karahiwala is a must-visit for anyone in Surrey looking for delicious, authentic South Asian cuisine. With its tasty dishes, friendly service, and inviting atmosphere, it promises a dining experience that will leave you looking forward to your next visit."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOVaNmlWNSVNvyCr9KmO39TrtNfnmBzo0C21B1G\u0026fid=0x0:0x88d700e948135efd""],""When"":""2024-6-17""},{""Name"":""samra khalid"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXs2qSAsTg55dIlF-si-Zppj95oi-N4B2CxFDpnKQMFmEzpjCciCQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Excellent experience of having authentic scrumptious karahis(Koila, Shinwari and kabab karahis).

When I received my order, but upon reaching home, I discovered that the hashbrowns, a water bottle, and the Happy Meal box were missing. I immediately called the store to report the issue but received no response. After several attempts, the manager, Ravneet, finally answered the call. When I inquired about the missing items, she told me that they had been left on the counter, implying that it was my mistake for not picking them up.\n\nDespite explaining the situation, Ravneet did not make any effort to resolve the issue or offer any assistance. She spoke in a dismissive and rude manner, which I found completely unacceptable.

Whoever manages this particular restaurant does not care how the staff are trained, or they are purposely making wrong orders to save on food cost.

First off, $10 for entry to an event organized by Diamond Events? Wow, what a steal! Too bad we weren’t told it was a chaotic mess masquerading as a 'gathering'. So, we show up, ready to enjoy our evening, and what do we get? A cozy table until, of course, they decided mid-meal to shuffle us off to an isolated corner like we were the last people invited to the party. A real treat, especially when we were busy eating.\n\nThen, as if that wasn’t enough of a delightful surprise, the manager actually had the nerve to come over and, in an incredibly generous move, inform us that we didn’t even need to pay if we weren't part of their next mess of an event. So kind, thank you! I was starting to think maybe I had made a terrible mistake paying for this chaos.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the pre-reserved seating for the event organizers because, of course, there’s no need to give your paying customers a heads-up about that, right? Who doesn’t love being blindsided mid-meal? Next time, how about putting up a big sign outside the pub, “Hey, if you’re not part of the club, enjoy sitting in the back like a forgotten afterthought!”\n\nOh, and the food? A culinary masterpiece. The fries were passable, but the wings? Let’s just say I’ve had better wings from a 7-Eleven microwave. Maybe the event was supposed to be a test of how much nonsense customers could tolerate before they completely lose their appetite because trust me, you’ve passed with flying colors.\n\n5 Tara?

However, while we were eating, organizers came over and abruptly asked us to leave the table, claiming it was reserved.\n\nThis was incredibly unprofessional for several reasons:\n1. Charging an entry fee without sufficient seating: If there was no space available for us, we should not have been allowed to enter, or at least we should have been informed beforehand.\n2. Giving us a table only to make us leave mid-meal: This was not only inconvenient but also disrespectful. Had we known, we would have chosen a different venue.\n3.

Food was good like always but the service was probably the worst I've ever had in my life.\n\nFrom the get go it took around 30 minutes to get my first drink and get food ordered(arrived at 530pm and it was dead). And from then on it took roughly 30 minutes to order a new drink everytime. We had to start ordering 2 drinks at a time to combat this. I don't know if my and friend and I are that ugly but it seemed like our waitress wanted nothing to do with us. Never asked us how our food was and 3 hours in, half our table was full of plates because she wouldn't take them(I didn't say anything cause I wanted to see how long it would take).\n\nNights like this we usually drop around $200 per person. Today was about $80 per person due to the lack of service and it wasn't that busy. We would've spent more if we were able to.\n\nAt the end I grabbed the both our tabs and opted to not leave a tip. She took the receipt, looked at it and threw it in front of me, gave me a passive aggressive \""have a great night\"" and walked away. Like if you hate your job that much just quit.\n\nSorry BP Nordel but we won't be back.

Please learn what customer services is and what it takes to have a customer especially during this pandemic time. Everyone is struggling so if you have a customer please value and appreciate them rather than giving them burnt and dry food.\nHere is a picture of what their 3 pounds of fresh chicken pakora looks like.

While the food was undeniably excellent, our overall experience was marred by disappointing customer service.\n\nWe arrived around midnight, as the restaurant advertised closing at 1 o'clock. Upon inquiry, we were informed that the last order would be taken at 12:45, which seemed reasonable. We proceeded to order, thoroughly enjoying the Nepali traditional soup and other appetizers.\n\nHowever, our dining experience took a turn for the worse when we attempted to order our main course around 12:30. Despite the restaurant not yet reaching its supposed closing time, we were abruptly informed that the kitchen was closing and they would not be able to take our order. This was incredibly frustrating and made us feel uncomfortable, especially since we had already made our dining plans for the evening.\n\nWhile we appreciated the offer of takeaway, it was disappointing to be denied the opportunity to enjoy a sit-down meal as originally intended. The discrepancy between the advertised operating hours and the actual service provided was unacceptable, leaving us with a sour impression of an otherwise promising establishment.\n\nIn summary, while Kathmandu Bar and Grill boasts outstanding food, the subpar customer service experience leaves much to be desired."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMbCpL6DbilHV_r3Y23qMaWcjTXt1FDSqK3ZVj6\u0026fid=0x0:0x85fe86fbbce82bcd""],""When"":""2024-4-25""},{""Name"":""Gurkirat"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW5rNVJu0-bVM9CBg1YbKcpRzQD610AZj9oSPpTB4GRGKRviE3n=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""The food is  good, but the service was really bad.

They dont have fried chicken anymore. They only have chiken wings and look at the photo. The shape and size of wings. I dont know why they withdrew regular fried chicken. Totally disappointed.

Its a straight 5 star for them."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMqBH6lqSJURP59AmwaR0tmr1mQh79IoTk2cF1S\u0026fid=0x0:0x74e48e7000e7ef20""],""When"":""2024-10-14""},{""Name"":""Zeeshan Sohail"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXQzSgXcEIo5d0fY039IL3LLi7k1i-9eyjB9u0xnur9BQekUdtD=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Fantastic addition to the local karahi scene.

Someone walked up to me and told that they can change the chicken for me but we all lost appetite after seeing the blood. When I went to pay the bill , the same person ( who walked up to me) proudly told that they have given me a 10% discount to compensate the unpleasant experience that we have to go through. Even though I told them I did not eat and they can consider not to change for my meal but they seems to be only happy giving 10% on overall bill.

It wasn't too busy during dinner time on a Sunday and I was able to get seated right away.\n\nI ordered the following:\n- Kabuli Palaw \u0026 Lamb Shank\n- Beef Kebab\n- Qaimaq Chai (pink tea)\n\nThe Kabuli Palaw \u0026 Lamb Shank was delicious. The lamb meat came right off the bone and complimented the rice really well. The flavors and texture of the dish were great, it reminds me of Biryani which I also love. One Con I would say about the dish is that the side of potatoes and the sauces could be a bit more generous in my opinion.\n\nI also ordered a side of beef kebab which I thought was great flavor wise, but it did seem a bit dry in my opinion.\n\nTo top off my meal I decided to try out the Qaimaq Chai (Afghan Pink Tea). It does take some time to prepare since it's made to order, but it was definitely worth it! It was creamy, refreshing and hot to help digest the food.\n\nService here was great, and the staff were friendly. Interior was clean and cozy with good lighting. Only thing I would mention is regarding the seating - the tables are a bit on the taller side, so unless you're a tall person then it might feel slightly awkward when eating, but honestly it's not a huge deal, just something I observed while dining in. Also they do have TV's inside the restaurant but I noticed it was just being used to play Spotify music - would be pretty nice to have a variety of Afghani music videos playing or something or maybe just have it on the sports channel.\n\nThere's plenty of free parking in this lot, so you'll never have to worry about finding where to park. The place is relatively easy to get to as well. It's just along Scott Road (120 ST).\n\nOverall, this is a nice place to grab some Afghani food here in Surrey.

In the end, she didn’t let me use the verification code to get the 2nd pizza free， but instead charge me an extra dollar. Today, I am not upset about the extra dollar I had to pay, but rather about the entire transaction not being conducted with integrity. Additionally, when they provided me with a validation code, they did not mention that the previous purchase receipt had to be presented upon use. Now, asking for it at the last minute makes me feel that the staff deliberately made an excuse to avoid honoring the discount I was entitled to, which I find disgraceful.

I was having a craving for fish and chips. I found the Britannia Brewing right across the street from my location. I walked into an inviting trendy at Chic restaurant. I was met by a lovely lady and taken to a table. I'm not someone who likes to try new things and when I notice the fish and chips wasn't the typical fish and chips I was skeptical. I spoke to my waitress and she explained the dish in detail. She knows her menu. Well. I found the staff to be dressed in comfortable yet professional manner making the place feel very relaxed and inviting. I did order the fish and chips and they were the best I've ever had. The batter was not thick and over breaded nor was it greasy. The flavor was delicious! They gave me two large pieces and french fries. I love the homemade tartar sauce. I ordered a pop as well and they even brought a slice of lime in there which I thought was a nice touch. I'm especially impressed with the fact that they have three bathrooms. One is wheelchair accessible tastefully decorated. In fact the whole restaurant is tastefully decorated!  I will not hesitate to go back in order to recommend this to as many people that are willing to listen."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMXKShd1mPP3RLZleiMiBTr4WHfZNNwITCitKwe\u0026fid=0x0:0x775f3939f7f511d8""],""When"":""2024-5-13""},{""Name"":""Ross McCutcheon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV17RLqBCwI7SSR47xRsCSTT37HMSG55hKmTlfuQXCdFOnVSNzm=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best try this one before the lineups start.

My first impressing walking in wasn’t the best, they had the signs inside right infront of the door so it was really difficult to get in, quite hazardous for people with injury’s or disability’s. Maybe it was because it was 30 minutes before closing? But if you order a pizza they should expect people to be coming in before closing. So it felt quite unwelcoming. For the food I was disappointed after a spending $40 bucks on two medium gluten free pizzas that I paid extra for the toppings and didn’t receive them as I looked into the box at first glance I was disappointed. When I got home to eat the pizza, the crust was raw. I’ve had the gluten free pizza before and it’s been absolutely delicious, so to take a bite into raw pizza dough was unpleasant. I’m not sure if they weren’t familiar with the gluten free dough so they didn’t cook it long enough? I’m hoping next time it’ll be better, and it was just an accident.

Crispiness is similar to Costco fries. Only suggestion is to have some ketchup laying around somewhere.\n\nWings - by far the best wings I had so far in Greater Vancouver. I’m from Toronto where we have a huge chicken wing scene. Vancouver severely lacks this and I was SO excited to find this place through a TikTok review.\n\nThe wings did not disappoint! Prices are super fair for the portions - we got Honey Garlic with Gar Par (One of my favorites from a chain back home). We got 2lbs - we hadn’t ate for the day and the 2lb + fries were perfect portions for 2 hungry people.\n\nI’m looking forward to trying more items off their menu and more of wings!\n\nStaff is super friendly too.

I bought the large meat lovers and my buddy got 1lb of buffalo bbq wings. My pizza was mid at best for $20 with tax, but overall could’ve been worse. Now for the wings, after getting home I took the wings off the pizza box and realized the issue, we had only received 1/2 lb of wings for $16. With the packaging it came to 0.73lbs. Personally this is ridiculous, $16 for 1/2lb of mediocre - dry - but relatively flavourful wings. Now the painful part, i was going to give them the benefit of the doubt and called to explained the issue, but was met with a condescending tone explaining they deemed 10-12 wings as 1lb which was most definitely not our case. I politely asked for a refund as I was quite frustrating but they just hung up on me. Mediocre food, less than paid for and unfortunately rude staff.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate the fast response and have kindly uploaded the photo provided. I understand ~10 wings can weigh 1lb pre cooked. Unfortunately in light of this new information I still cannot personally recommend this establishment, the ~30% loss due to cooking, price point, quality of food and customer experience have just lost me."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM9Bfyl56eptSqBeF-u3mMnTKarZSr4KYvjVKur\u0026fid=0x0:0xa1ce476adc9b862a""],""When"":""2023-4-7""}]",

Unfortunately, what I encountered was a far cry from the brand's usual standards. The food was presented in a haphazard manner—burgers seemingly assembled in a rush, with cheese sliding off the bun like an afterthought. To make matters worse, the burger buns were stale around the edges, further diminishing the overall experience.\n\nThe dining area itself was no better. Tables were visibly dirty and had not been cleaned in some time, with trash scattered around. To my shock, some individuals were even laying on the floors, creating a chaotic and uninviting atmosphere for guests.\n\nWhat truly baffled me, however, was learning that this location does not honor complimentary drink refills for dine-in customers—a staple of the McDonald’s experience. It seems this franchise has chosen to deviate from the brand's norms and impose its own rules, leaving customers frustrated.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the manager’s demeanor was outright rude when I inquired about the refill policy. Rather than addressing the concern with understanding, their dismissive attitude left a bitter taste far worse than the stale bun.

On [insert date], I placed an order that included four items, one of which was a box of chicken nuggets. However, upon receiving my order, I noticed that the chicken nuggets were missing. I immediately contacted the store to resolve the issue, but the response I received was far from satisfactory.\n\nFirstly, when I called to report the missing item, the person on the phone provided a service that I found to be unprofessional. Not only was the resolution unclear, but the individual did not communicate the order code audibly, making the situation more frustrating.\n\nWhen I visited the store in person to show my receipt and explain the situation, the staff did not even take the time to properly listen to my concern. Instead, they reacted by criticizing me and were unwilling to address the issue. I expected better from a global brand like McDonald’s, especially in terms of customer service and professionalism.\n\nWhile the missing item was valued at only $8, it is not the amount but the principle of customer satisfaction and trust that is at stake. I believe that paying for an item and not receiving it constitutes a breach of trust, and the unprofessional handling of this issue only compounded my disappointment.\n\nI kindly request that this matter be looked into and resolved appropriately. I would appreciate a refund for the missing item and any necessary action taken to ensure that this type of experience is not repeated for other customers."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOvNiaHAP01J5-MTpzLi8PhWRxwcLKXsq4qKJsI\u0026fid=0x0:0x6cfb50410b1b5274""],""When"":""2024-10-18""},{""Name"":""amita Morker"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKvsZ5qFZb-WRJWkXiKEOAHm9ZqJPpaPiYkMLb4GWEfgDE0Wg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Rude service.

Tidewaters Pub for about 3 years off and on with friends to watch UFC fights, but after today, I’ll never return.

After sitting for 30 minutes waiting for the fights to come on, the waitress told us there was a “mistake” and that you may not be getting the fights after all. Soon after, she stood awkwardly by the entrance as the channel switched to football instead.\n\nTo the owner: Was saving $70 worth more than keeping loyal customers? The service was unprofessional, and your failure to honor your advertisement ruined what was supposed to be a great event. We had to leave and go somewhere else, only catching a few fights of what was an amazing card.

We still got a few things, including vanilla milkshake and latte, to highlight Avalon's main product, which is milk. I tried Avalon produce before, so I was delighted with both items. The milkshake was simply perfect and not too sweet. The interior is pretty cool and cozy with lots of great decorations. We ended up getting some milk produce to go.

But the good news was that we brought it home added more cheese and banana peppers and warm it up in the oven, and it came out perfect. 👌 The sliders were very dry. The bread was like a few days too many in the freezer. Well again, we brought the sliders home, we swapped out for fresher buns and made our homemade beef patties, and the sliders turned out perfect 👌.

Boy, what a surprise! They serve Fat Tug IPA on the tap! I started going there regularly, first for the beer, then I discovered their excellent food selection and made friends with their friendly staff.\nYou guessed it, I love this pub.

The waiter had only brought me one bowl of rice, which wasn’t enough. I requested an additional one, but he was too busy to bring it. After waiting too long, I asked another waiter for the rice, even saying, “Where is the rice? Should I get it myself?” The second waiter eventually handed me another bowl.\n\nLater, when I went to pay the bill, the first waiter showed that I had eaten three bowls of rice. I said, “Oh, you made a mistake, I only ate two bowls of rice.” He then changed the bill to two but returned, insisting, “Actually, you’re mistaken - you ate three!”\n\nWhat the hell?😲😲😲 Why??? Why would I lie about $2???🤬🤬🤬\n\nI was angered by his attitude and refused to pay the bill, demanding that they show me the CCTV footage, or I wouldn’t pay a cent.\n\nHe told his coworker and the manager, who simply said it was a minor issue and that there were no cameras at the table. The manager wasn’t sure how many bowls I ate but kept repeating that it wasn’t a big deal, eventually letting it go.\n\nThroughout this whole process, no one apologized. Their attitude was extremely arrogant, as if I really had eaten three bowls of rice and was just trying to cheat them out of paying for one! It was incredibly disrespectful! I’m not a beggar!😡😡😡\n\nI paid the bill, but left no tip.👎\n\nIt wasn’t about the $2 rice - it was about dignity. I told them there was no reason to lie over $2.

It’s a fairly new restaurant as we have seen it build out while visiting the Oval for the last couple of years.  We have read and heard good and bad things about the restaurant.\nFirst of all parking is underground and reimbursed at $2.50.  So if you paid for two hours they will reimburse half of it.\nWe made reservations for 12:15 and were seated right away by a friendly host.\nIt was Saturday and the restaurant was busy.  The servers could be seen quickly picking up plates and serving dim sum to each table.\nOnce we sat down we went through the order sheet that was in english and chinese.   The form seemed a little busy but if you take your time it’s pretty straight forward to check off what you want to order.\nWe ordered Jasmine tea but you have a full selection so just ask.\nOnce we gave the order to the server the dim sum came fairly quickly.\nI give props to the chefs for attempting to elevate the dim sum.  That being said some things are better left alone.\nThe pineapple bun with wagyu beef was a nice treat.  Honestly I could not tell if it was beef or char siu (roast pork).  It was very yummy though.\nThe fried mochi balls with pork aka ham sui gok was yummy.  The green food colouring was not necessary.\nThe fried Taro balls with scallop were good.\nThe shrimp spring rolls were nicely done.\nThe abalone truffle sauce siu mai was delicious however this brings me to one of my complaints.  If you are going to elevate dim sum you also have to be consistent in plating and presentation.  Take a look at my pic and see where one of the abalones is off centred.\nThe traditional dishes, beef balls, tripe, chicken feet,  and pork wrapped in bean curd are done well.\nThe fried radish cake in XO sauce was really tasty but could have used more bean sprouts garnish and sauce!\nThe har gao shrimp dumplings were good.  Really not sure there was a need for a green wrap to the middle one.\nThe shrimp and scallop dumpling was good.\nThe salted egg yolk buns were cute but more importantly the filling super yummy.\nWe also ordered the fried taro and lychee bun.

lunch at Cactus Club Cafe. Upon arriving without a reservation, we were told it would be a wait to be seated outside, or we could get seated inside the Lounge immediately. I wanted the harbour views from the terrace so I opted to wait. I'd say it was about a 10 to 15 minute wait, but I didn't mind because watching the hostess work was amazing. She was very efficient, a powerhouse in heels, and with a smile.\n\nOnce we were finally seated at our table, they didn't have physical menus, only virtual, but this suited me fine. I finally decided on the Truffle Parmesan Chicken and my partner got the Steak.\n\nThe food was sublime. The chicken was absolutely delicious, crispy outside, and well seasoned. The gnocchi was to die for, melt in your mouth soft, and the sauce was flavourful. Even the mushrooms were absolutely gorgeous tasting, like an explosion of flavour in your mouth. My partner's steak was good, but my chicken was so much better.\n\nOn the other hand, the drinks were very poor. A bit too boozy for my tastes and expensive.\n\nWe also got the chocolate cake to share and it was good but super rich and decadent. We could barely finish it between the two of us and the vanilla ice cream did little to help.\n\nOverall, Cactus is clearly a popular spot and the food is enough justification why. I would love to go back and have their chicken again, so I highly recommend it if you are going to check it out!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO_v_CNbqgFBuRPQcRLX0kV89uQlV2uMlojf4w6\u0026fid=0x0:0x60248a028fed8b2a""],""When"":""2024-9-21""},{""Name"":""Anton Castillo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJOQnue1D_0cDF6CxLvXY1pJBzVXlenLeHbcfuDm1CVjN6ChQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Aidan our server was very nice and knowledgeable.

I’m a huge seafood fan and love a good seafood tower, so with the help of my friend we did our best to take down the yatch sized tower! We were both thinking should we order an appy just in case the tower isn’t enough and I was soooo glad we didn’t! The tower has soo much seafood and could easily fulfill even 4 people with a sufficient amount of food, though with 4 you may need an appetizer? My fiancée had the fish and chips and she said she enjoyed them, nothing special but good fish and chips all the same! Our server was great, treating us all to a welcome/happy birthday shot and a nice piece of cake for dessert. The restaurant is a great spot and must be even better during a nice day. Solid food, service and atmosphere and would definitely go back to try something off the menu that is not a tower.

(I am pretty sure when you made reservation, there wasn't an option as to which table you want to sit) so I am surprised she wasn't being flexible. When asked if I could at least turned my chair the other way, she said unfortunately no, due to the spacing (perhaps the waitress might not have enough space to walk around?) but I was very certain, there would still have space.\n\nLuckily, another server at the patio was very understanding and helped us asked the hostess again and finally we were able to move to another table before the food arrive. *Note: one of the empty tables was empty the whole time, she could have easily switch me at the beginning.\n\nThe food was pretty good for Happy Hour, I would say the price is a bit expensive.

Creek offers a unique ambiance that's on the darker side, which some might find appealing, though it’s not to my taste. Their cocktails are a highlight—I'd highly recommend the Spicy Mango Margarita; it's exceptional.\n\nThe appetizers are decent. The wings are tasty, but the fries are pretty standard, and the nachos are just okay. Unfortunately, the main course falls short. The pizzas, especially the Meat Lovers, were overly salty and perhaps some of the worst I’ve had in Vancouver. The fish and chips were disappointingly bland, and needing to request salt for a dish is far from ideal.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t recommend Mahony's for the main course.

Now I totally appreciate that this is fast food and I am at the ferry terminal on new years eve but still… I ordered a vegetarian quesadilla with guacamole on the side. Not especially challenging.

There was NO friggin’ cheese to hold the contents in the tortilla, so every time I picked up one of the tiny little bite-size pieces that the woman behind the counter chopped the quesadilla into (why???), the contents fell out because there was nothing to bind it to the tortilla. Couldn’t dip it in the salsa or the sour cream - OR the nonexistent guacamole that I paid an extra $3 for but that they just never gave me. I’ve attached a photo of the contents left at the bottom of the take away container. My hand is next to it to give some size context. (I can’t believe I paid $15 for this!)\n\nThe Icing on the cake was when I dialled the number on their website to try to arrange for some sort of refund and the recorded female voice said very unenthusiastically “Yeah, you can leave a message” - but no, I actually couldn’t because the friggin’ mailbox was full! (Of course it was…)\n\nEven though the four women were behind the counter were very sweet, just avoid this place.
