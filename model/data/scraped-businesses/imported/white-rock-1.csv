I used to visit their Vancouver location all the time, before it unfortunately closed. Kind staff, and was nice to see a familiar face! My go-to is their be the creator bowl. Their charred chicken tikka, roasted cauliflower, and mint mayo sauce are not to be missed. I also ordered a Liquid Gold smoothie with a base of oat milk. The drink was delicious and so creamy! Minimal ginger taste, which was fine for me!\n\nThis location sells pizza as well (under the brand Pizza Dough Therapy and Oja's Blend), and the staff were kind enough to let us try a piece (pepperoni and vegetable). Can attest that it was a good slice of pizza! I don't know if I'll be able to part with my favourite bowl, but the pizza sure is tempting! They have a deal on pizza on Tuesdays where their medium pizzas are $10.99 - half off the regular price of $20.77. The White Rock location is quite far for me, but I was happy to return and look forward to my next visit. Hoping they open more locations in the future!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMd5Pxvz1O4HsCNwyOOD5_p4IR1FW-9QWvNoAu4\u0026fid=0x0:0x6163c9d0eaa8d8d7""],""When"":""2024-11-13""},{""Name"":""Mer_bestybay"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-YRI28t2Ru_2IKmV1DodXyZ-Qg6RUTjLngyQR9W1eMj5KQndl=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I got the Funky Chicken and Cauli-Sautra bowl and they were both AMAZING.

The meals are not only full of flavor but also well-balanced, with a great mix of protein, fiber, and carbs, so you can enjoy the taste without feeling guilty.  Overall the food is really delicious no matter what you try. Every bite felt thoughtfully made.\n\nOn top of the delicious food their customer service was exceptional. The staff were welcoming and attentive, the restaurant ambience was very chill and relaxed, and there’s plenty of seating, plus a huge parking area making the whole experience very comfortable.\n\nIf you're looking for a place that combines healthy eating with great taste and friendly service, I highly recommend Ojas.

The establishment had a hipster aesthetic look, despite being a brunch restaurant. I ordered the Tiramisu French Toast with Coffee. The coffee was decent, and they serve it with cream in a steel bell pourer and raw brown sugar packets. The french toast practically tastes like a cake, in a great way. The vanilla espresso mascarpone was potent in palate, and it was covered in cocoa powder and cookie crumble. They also serve it with maple syrup in a steel bell as well. The waiters are admirable about their work and never neglect their customers. Overall, this is a fantastic restaurant for breakfast and lunch.

My partner loved the salmon and I really enjoyed the oysters there 😋\n\nThey were also so sweet to my partner’s kiddo and were so kind when he spilled Pepsi all over himself 😅 which reminds me that my partner also specifically said he really loved the napkin quality there?? Haha.\n\nThat being said, the best part was the customer service. The staff there are fantastic. They’re super personable and sweet and I was so happy they all remembered us on our second visit. Absolutely 100000/10 service, thank you Dean, Mateo, and of course our first night’s server. She was the sweetest woman ever and I’m so sorry I don’t know her name. But we loved her.

and I visited the Morrison Cafe at the corner of Johnson Road and Pacific Avenue on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago just before Halloween. Boy are we glad we did, Jasmine our waitress to start with was amazing, super friendly and so accommodating for everything and it wasn't too busy so we got some exceptional service not to say that it wouldn't have been that way if the place was full.\nWe started off with the seafood salmon dinner and a good bottle of wine. The wine was excellent and so was the seafood salmon along with a great solid potato wedges and superbly flavored vegetables, everything was exceptional except for the salmon with the shrimp and scallops was not as flavorful as we would have liked with the dill sauce however it was still very acceptable.\nThen we decided to try the two-piece fish and chip dinner and they gave us half of the regular fries and half of the Masala fries and that was outstanding and the tartar sauce was amazing as well. We were full and by then we had been there over an hour and a half and then Abby the owner showed up and asked if we'd ever tried his carrot cake and we are not super big on desserts however Abby was gracious enough the owner to give us a complimentary piece of carrot cake to try and it was truly the best carrot cake I've ever had both of us actually.\nIt was so good I asked what would you charge for a whole tray as I we were going to a Halloween party the next day.\nSo we negotiated a great price and I showed up the next day to pick it up and it was actually two full trays we froze one and took the other to the Halloween party and it was a huge hit. Abby even gave me a cake serving knife which I will be returning in the next few days.\nThis was a truly amazing experience and if you haven't tried out the Morrison Cafe at either of their two locations you're in for a great treat it is not just for breakfast or brunch or lunch please try out their dinner and please see the  photos below."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP4V26PqCCYuSqxCfO6saBhsl6zEeOKGN-EoGER\u0026fid=0x0:0xa12c46e871453fb9""],""When"":""2024-11-9""},{""Name"":""Lelaina Lindsay"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW6lhE5QzkR1uqsg6IgP5pav-urj0DJqD937D0GKPMoQS-NYgbo=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food is fantastic, my husband said the best wings he's ever had.

I took him for lunch at Surfside Grill. Upon entering, your hostess was gossiping with a server and barely acknowledged our existence. The rest of the servers were hanging out at the bar with the bar tenders chatting. My Fiance has managed night clubs, restaurants and bars his entire adult life and this was a huge turn off for him and for me as I am a marketing manager and presentation of a restaurant is everything in running one.Staff should always be aware of this. We were seated at a dirty table when there were at least five clean ones to sit us at. The Hostess didn't even acknowledge it was dirty and left us there. The server came and I had to ask for the table to be cleaned as she just threw down two menus. She then only wiped up the space in front of me and my fiance, not the entire table. A dirty knife was left on the ground and stepped over and walked around by multiple staff at least 7 times until they noticed I took a picture of it, which I attached to this review. The food came out fast, that was the only good thing to say so we could eat and get out of there. The cooks must be fairly decent. The food was good. I had the coconut shrimp and my fiance had the spicy chicken sandwich. Props to the cooks. However, we will NEVER return. The cleanliness was lacking, the staff presentation of the restaurant was disgraceful. Where did work ethic go? If I owned that place, everyone but the cooks would be FIRED. Disgusted with the service. Sad because for the prices we pay, you would think your expectation of staff would be higher. My advice to owners, fire everyone and hire people that value customer service, and treat people the way they want to be treated. PS - I purposely left a piece of coleslaw on the side of the table, when we walked by after we left, the table had been cleaned but the coleslaw was still there.

Reviews also looked decent so away we went.\n\nFood: All of us ordered fish \u0026 chips with extra tartar. Overall the food was pretty good. I wouldn't say it was my favourite fish \u0026 chips, but would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a decent meal.\n\nService: I found the service a bit subpar on a Sunday afternoon for a popular restaurant. It wasn't overly busy, the outside patio was full but they had plenty of room inside. There appeared to be plenty of employees, but everything from seating, getting drinks \u0026 food ordered, to actually receiving the check was slow. Had to request the check after about 10 minutes of having our food taken away. But I may just be an opinionated tourist.\n\nAtmosphere: I loved the view of the water while eating. Even tho we were inside we still had a lovely view with the lovely breeze. Would be a wonderful spot to eat, have a drink and enjoy the sunset 🌇\n\nOverall: I really enjoyed Charlie Don't Surf.

We also ordered calamari for $15.95 with 2 steam works brew pints for $7.50 each ($15 total).\nThe price for the fish and chips was fair and the ratio from batter to fish was on point. Tartar sauce doesn't come with the fish, so a medium size is $1.25 - the tartar sauce wasn't all that great, so lemon and vinegar would do the trick unless it's a must for the tartar. The fries were nice and crispy and didn't come saturated in salt.

The fries were hot, crispy fresh cut fries and were amazing. Tartar sauce is delicious and they give large portions.\n\nThe coleslaw is also quite good and i would recommend ordering that as well to help cut through the grease and balance things out a bit.\n\nCan’t wait to come back!

This cosy restaurant will bring you the best Island vibes and will serve you authentic Jamaican food you’ll ever try. There’s a few free parking spots available right outside, convenient for a take-out order collection, and if you’re dining in, it’s easy to park and dine in.\n\nService: we were greeted by a warm reception from a lovely gentleman at the bar. We got to choose a table to our preference and were served with warmth and smiles, like a typical Jamaican welcome is known for. Our drinks were served promptly (had a glass of Pinot Grigio and a fruit punch). The fruit punch was created from scratch and fresh. Our host was thoroughly informative on portions and advised what to expect in each dish we picked out.\n\nFood: we ordered 2 spicy beef patties (which Jamaica is known for famously), and they were so tasty! Freshly baked in the oven, crisp pastry and well seasoned beef filling, patties were served with their own homemade scotch bonnet pepper  sauce. It is very hot, so dip sparingly! For mains we ordered oxtail and curry goat. Oh goodness gracious, what an experience that was! The blend of flavours in both meats were superb! Accompaniments were rice ‘n’ peas (black beans, as authentic to Caribbean rice and peas style), steamed cabbage (with just enough crunch and flavour in them), and a quarter of shallow fried plantain. Each meat dish was decadent, succulent, fall off the bone yet juicy. With each bite, left us wanting more! We’ve had authentic Jamaican and other Caribbean cuisine before, in the Caribbean itself, and this food was just as you would be served in the islands. I would and will go again anytime I am in white rock, without a doubt!\n\nPro-tip: so, we loved our beef patties so much that we ordered a dozen to take home with us! The host gave us very clear instructions on getting them right in the oven. We tried at home and they were wonderful!

Second time here. First time was somewhat busy and this time was the same. However, we were seated right away and did not have to wait. Lots of people in and out, as well as, a bunch of take out orders. Even with everything going on, I was surprised how quickly our food arrived. Must have been less than 10 mins after we ordered. Our order was not small either - 5 dishes for the four of us.\n\nWe ordered #40 seafood with rice noodle in soup, #44 egg noodle beef stew, #5 chicken wings, #2 pork spring rolls, #62 grilled lemongrass chicken and pork chop on rice. The wife had the beef stew and I had the rice dish. She was pleasantly surprised with the beef stew dish. For context, she always orders either the beef stew or the bun bo hue. The bun bo hue did not do much for her last time, but the stew she was a fan of. The soup was tasty and the beef tender. For me, I liked both the house special I had the first time and the rice dish I had this time. The meat was tender and flavorful, but would have liked the pork chop to be a bit more charred like the chicken was. Both the chicken and pork chop were cooked well. The rice was on the harder side though and would of been helped with more fish sauce.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars for food since the seafood noodle soup dish and the bun bo hue were kind of bland and looked nothing like the picture in the menu. My guess is special dishes arent ordered as much and thats why they aren't as good. Regardless, they weren't bad, but looked kind of sad since we were expecting a bit more variety. The seafood content was lacking compared to other places we've been at. Seemed like it was loaded with more imitation crab than anything else.\n\nBoth the chicken wings and the spring rolls were spot on. Lots of flavor and cooked perfectly and not overly salty. They did seem crisper than usual though - maybe too long in the fryer. The spring rolls had a ton of taste and left me wanting more - I would be happy just eating spring rolls all day long.\n\nAll in all, this place exceeded our expectations. The food tasted great and wasn't overly salty or sweet (a common thing I am finding in South Surrey). Service was excellent with little to no wait and the portion sizes weren't small that's for sure. But, like every where else, prices are up across the board. On the plus side, it's always a good sign when the wife brings home the take out menu. Will definitely be back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPXNnFPMTPruOcDikuduobIHR42YvHRtNezPY-U\u0026fid=0x0:0x532543d844fced31""],""When"":""2024-1-22""},{""Name"":""Eli D."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJLVehZaCki3TC6GcyJmDr7Wgh9MoZgACCVQfzP-Iv2zYNcg3Xx=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Pho 777 is always excellent!

They are based from Nagoya. You must take off your shoes to seat yourself to eat. Each table is sectioned off in quarters enclosed with the curtains so it feels like you are having a private dinner with your group or dinner date. Truly one of a kind of a restaurant; a must try for all. The experience is worth the price. Definitely not a place to come when you are hungry, but perfect for a fine-dining experience.\n\nVibe: Great authentic vibe, the minute we walked in, we were welcomed by courteous staff. We truly felt like we were back in Japan.\n\nFlavour: Truly amazing flavours we haven’t had elsewhere. The prawn gyoza came in 5 at the price of $9. Each gyoza had one full prawn in tact with the tail, and was extremely flavourful wrapped in a pork filling inside. Accompanying it was a slightly sweet and tart vinegar based sauce. Chef's Assorted Sashimi ($40) was definitely a smaller portion, but very freshly sourced sashimi, and the star of that order was the prawn sashimi (extremely buttery and sweet). White Rock Roll was extremely flavourful, not only because it had lots of filling, but the seaweed used was of a high quality and the flavour really worked well with the filling. Also, although the roll was massive, none of the ingredients fell to pieces as you picked up a piece of the roll, and this speaks to the chef’s attention to detail.\n\nOriginality: Gyozas were extraordinary, first time I’ve seen them with tails at the end, but retains moisture and juiciness. \""Gyo Za\"" soup, you can tell it was freshly made to order, with a swirled egg added and one gyoza in the soup (small portion for 1 only).\n\nService: Extremely courteous staff, kind and thoughtful. Provided complimentary Gomae while we waited for our food. Food came out in order, with appetizers to start, and allowed time in between to allow guests to fully enjoy the experience. The mains came shortly after.\n\nOverall Experience/Star of the Show: Prawn Gyoza and Whiterock Roll."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMlxwXh7gpJ1OJ3ciL-FC2rwnlWIYybKTDHyjkp\u0026fid=0x0:0x65530ccece6cd8b0""],""When"":""2019-9-10""},{""Name"":""Darryn Kar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXdGNilEUkcW7nP2qRJRgYVXsTqIq7xXPT3AZrLOJ53NlbgoSDg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Small traditional style Japanese restaurant, offers great service and a selection of fresh fish.

Susan, our server, was absolutely phenomenal. Friendly, professional, personable and easy to talk to as we were getting seated and ready to order. She was attentive and on top of things, throughout our entire meal, coming to check on us, refill waters, even though we were the only table outside on the patio, she didn't forget about us for one second. The patio was also amazing, the weather was great and had a lovely beach view.\n\nThe gesture from Susan that made the experience exceptional was that as she was collecting our dishes overheard our conversation about my friend's birthday which was last week. She generously offered to bring us a slice of cake and sang my friend happy birthday. Thank you Susan!!\n\nTowards the end of our meal, we also interacted with the hostess, Georgia, she was a gem as well. The food and service was amazing.\n\nAs for their food love love love their vegetarian moussaka 😍 bit on the pricey side so it's better for more celebratory occasions or treating yourself once in a while meals but their food is very delicious! Every single time!\n\nCan get a bit busy sometimes, esp during nicer summer days on the weekends but good if you're able to avoid those. Forgot some pita once from a doordash order during dinner rush but was able to get credit for it as soon as we realized something was missing and called.\n\nLove any excuse to order or dine at Cosmos 😊"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQli0ztCYwl3jB1kiis1vaVv5Sv6NqZkESHYUf\u0026fid=0x0:0xb376af80d8076a4c""],""When"":""2022-8-2""},{""Name"":""henry lo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJYQpQrlrCMMz950b2rs1RJvk42Xhtblpc6h8kmr87h5z3Avw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Had a date night with my partner there.

experience at the White Spot in White Rock, BC, was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment I entered the establishment, I was immediately struck by the ambiance, which was a harmonious blend of modern elegance and understated sophistication. The lighting was artfully subdued, casting a warm and inviting glow over the immaculately clean and meticulously organized dining area. The seating arrangement was spacious, allowing for a sense of privacy and intimacy, while still maintaining the vibrant buzz of a well-frequented, bustling restaurant.\n\nUpon being seated, I was promptly greeted by a staff member whose demeanor exuded professionalism and an unwavering commitment to exemplary service. Every interaction was polished and courteous, and it was clear that customer satisfaction was paramount. The waitstaff demonstrated an impeccable knowledge of the menu, offering insightful recommendations and showing an almost encyclopedic awareness of the dishes’ intricate ingredients and their potential pairings.\n\nAs for the culinary offerings, I was beyond impressed by the diversity and creativity embedded in the menu selections. I opted for the Legendary Burger 🍔, an iconic choice, which arrived as a culinary masterpiece, perfectly presented and meticulously crafted. The patty was succulent and flavorful, seasoned to perfection, and its texture was sublime, a delicate balance between tenderness and a satisfyingly slight crispiness on the edges. The amalgamation of fresh ingredients—lettuce, tomato, and their signature Triple O sauce—elevated the burger to new gastronomic heights. The flavor profile was both complex and well-rounded, offering a symphony of tastes that danced on the palate. The fries were nothing short of ethereal—crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside—delivering the perfect complement to the main course.\n\nThroughout the dining experience, the atmosphere remained convivial yet serene, striking the perfect balance between lively and relaxing. I was particularly impressed by the timing of the service; each course was brought to the table with precision, neither rushed nor delayed, allowing for a thoroughly enjoyable and leisurely dining experience.\n\nIn summary, White Spot in White Rock, BC, surpassed all expectations in every conceivable way. The food was exceptional, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was the epitome of refined comfort. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a dining experience that transcends the ordinary and ventures into the realm of the truly sublime."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNHPmcjo-swounHPvEkNvMfCt6rQBGokixoHJmu\u0026fid=0x0:0xb4879ed74ce9246e""],""When"":""2024-10-18""},{""Name"":""Joseph Fung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVkZEb8e5c-d48CtQKYY357rxTS2qVXdqhij1aQG0wnJ9RdQaSW8g=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""A Hidden Gem in White Rock 🌟\n\nThis was my sister's family's second-to-last night in Vancouver, and after a tiring trip back from Seattle, we decided to stop by White Spot. We stumbled upon this location in White Rock, and what a gem it is! 💎\n\nWe walked in around 7:30 PM, and to our surprise, it wasn't crowded at all. The spacious seating and perfectly done decor immediately set the tone for a relaxing evening. We were greeted by a friendly staff member with a big smile 😊—a sign that we were in for a good time.\n\nDespite not having much of an appetite, I let my 12-year-old niece order whatever she wanted while I opted for a kid's meal 🍔. My in-law chose the fish \u0026 chips 🐟🍟, my sister ordered a steak that was cooked to perfection 🥩, and my niece loved her teriyaki chicken bowl 🍜. I thoroughly enjoyed my kid's meal too—sometimes, simple is best!\n\nThe service was fantastic, likely because it was a quiet Monday night with everyone at home prepping for the week ahead.

I had about 3/4 of the burger until I realized that the thickest part of the chicken burger was fully raw inside. The burger was covered in a thick spicy sauce, so it was hard to notice how raw it was until I cut into it with a knife. White Spot is supposed to be a well established restaurant so we were all shocked at the rawness of the burger. I'm also heavily pregnant, so the risk of having uncooked/raw chicken is a huge risk to my baby and me. We immediately contacted White Spot, and the manager gave a $50 food credit via email for the \""disappointing experience\"" with the \""under done chicken\"" (an understatement...it was raw!!) which I think is ridiculous because firstly, why would we want to go back after this experience, and secondly, it's not even the entire bill or even a refund, but a food credit. It's one thing for a steak to be rare, or have raw fish like sushi, but chicken and pork cannot be eaten undercooked or raw. We're incredibly disappointed by the food and the way they handled the situation.

We'll try this place again given their reasonable prices and quality food."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNKphTAEPwWSpW7Gg5Mgh9JSd4NjSkULrRp1mb2\u0026fid=0x0:0x36c99e12f0a40d02""],""When"":""2017-10-16""},{""Name"":""daveyb98126"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUWKb9pyDzbo_yXTTCzLhDTAXkXAVT1nZ6moYVMdoT_IYD73ws6=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""An owner who genuinely cares about customers and the food.

Especially with the drinks.\n\nI actually really like their food here, of what I’ve tried. I’ve gotten the Mana bagel before and it was actually REALLY good. I was surprised how good it was given how simple it’s ingredients are. I also really like their poke. I’ve heard a lot of complaints about it as it’s not like “sushi poke” you see at a lot of other restaurants, but it’s supposed to be like traditional Hawaiian poke which I personally like a lot more.\n\nBack to drinks… I tried a smoothie one time, I forget which, but it was just okay. Nothing better than I could’ve made at home for half the price. $10 for a smoothie is pretty steep, although I do understand they use fresh fruit.\n\nTheir matcha tastes… really bad. It tastes fake. Like very low quality. It tastes like it has a lot of fillers rather than just being a pure ceremonial matcha. And the fact that they advertise it as “organic matcha tea” makes you think it’s going to be really good and authentic but it’s just not. The colour is also a lot paler and yellow-green rather than the bright vibrant green you see in high quality matcha.\n\nI’ve also tried their iced chai recently and it tastes good but not great. It’s super heavy on the cinnamon flavour. Chai is supposed to be a mixture of many different spices but it literally tastes like straight cinnamon.\n\nBtw I find $1 extra for non-dairy milk super steep. Even a giant like Starbucks who gouges every cent doesn’t charge quite that much. I could understand $0.50 or $0.75 but a whole dollar is a lot for the tiny bit of milk you end up pouring in most drinks.\n\nStaff are not friendly at all… no hello when you enter, no goodbye when you leave, even when they’re not busy. They don’t smile or tell you to have a good day when you grab your order, they’re not personable or chatty at all. And this isn’t just on one occasion, this is every time I’ve been in."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOuLdeeWLmyyn2-ZpjB-u96n1MvuwrMiST27Rf9\u0026fid=0x0:0xccaf50df2411c221""],""When"":""2024-7-20""},{""Name"":""Dianna Filippelli"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXz9XTsXE656tR16KgQZkN5rtINQZWCn27_tgMcMaIxSERt0meg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Surprisingly, I have never been to this location despite vacationing and living down the street. They don't overtly advertise, with extensive signage. Perhaps, this is unnecessary because the cafe has a unique theme and ambiance.\n\nMy order is always the same, so I've been able to compare the quality, presentation and taste in different locations. The White Rock site, definitely met my expectations for the aforementioned. The acai bowl both looked and tasted appealing. Moreover, the machiatos are made the European-way, simply with a dash of milk and shots of espresso . This enables you to actually distinguish the flavor of the coffee\nrather than the milk. Some Western cafes struggle with this concept.\n\nHence, I was delighted that I didn't have to educate or train the staff on the creation of these items. I will certainly return here more as a local.

Pasta was barely enough for one person (less than half a bowl). And chai was without sugar and only Splenda packets on the side. When I asked them for sugar for our chai, they said they were out of sugar. Also, the chai was ice cold. It looked like they made it in the freezer, not on the burner.\nToday, we ordered just 2 kulad chai again for takeout, and she said it will take 10-15 minutes. But, she brought it in just 2-3 minutes, and no surprise, it was without sugar again (with Splenda on the side). When I asked for sugar again, she said they are out of sugar. Like seriously!!! You guys are running a restaurant, and you are out of sugar from the last couple of months. Also, chai was again ice cold.\nJust a suggestion for you guys: please rename it from kulad chai to iced chai with Splenda for the sake of customers.\nWe literally drove from Abbotsford to White Rock during midnight to have refreshing chai and walk, and guess what?

The girl making my sandwich was friendly and nice but she kept touch her face and wiped her nose twice with the back of her wrist while preparing my sandwich. The sandwich was okay (the bread was delicious) but for a vegetable sandwich that cost $8.50 I would expect more than just cheese, mayo, mustard and a few vegetables (lettuce, cucumber and pickles (I declined the offered banana peppers and onions)). Maybe offer tomatoes? Avocado? Sprouts? Cream cheese?\nI also got the cheddar broccoli soup and ended up throwing it out as the thin soups  “cheese” wasn’t melted and had a weird texture and overall flavour. The donut was dry and obviously previous frozen and brought in.\n\nI was very pleased to see the wall of pre-bought meals and items that could be taken. I feel this could be better set up though. It’s behind the counter so you can’t read what’s available and also there is a sign to “give the prepaid ticket to the server” - how can you if it’s behind the counter?  If I also may suggest adding a “box lunch” option folks can pre-purchase that contains a choice of sandwich, a hot or cold drink, a bag of chips and a dessert bar or cookie?"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jen Young"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocICpnbsh8IYv5NAModSoK2ssetwisA-lJbz05jy-5pwIGGCMw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""Picked up two small meat pies for almost $10 realistically worth maybe three dollars each.

The portions are big and flavours authentic. I really enjoyed the Seafood Crispy Rice, which I have not had for a long time. The Sauteed Eggplant is also fantastic, with the garnish being a nice touch. However, be warned that for a vegetarian dish it contains meat.

If you like to have a selection of the delicious appies you better be there well before 6, the end of happy hour. After that the price goes up 3 dollars each. There is no indication of this increase on the menu. That was quite disappointing. I ordered the crispy chicken burger. After a long wait our meals arrived so we had to gobble them down in order to get across the street to the theatre.\nNow about that burger; those brioche buns are ridiculous. I deconstructed mine and just ate the filling with a knife and fork. There was way too much batter on the chicken but it was very tasty.

So, if you are looking for hoppy, yeasty, saltiness, sweet flavors in your beer, maybe this is not the best place.\n\nI am a cafe kind of person more than a pub hoppers. When I found the place when having a walk in the area by accident, I wanted to go in right away. It looked so cute and sassy for a brewery. :3 the business hour looked unusual for a brewery, but I loved it a lot. It makes the place more unique. We love places like that, so I brought him with me today.\n\nThe bartenders were friendly,  knowledgeable, attentive, and helpful.  The ambiance was so great!! Regular customers from the community hang out there appreciating the company with the bartenders and other regular customers. I was too shy to talk to them. But after some beers, I talked to the people who probably visited there for the first time like us, and we played a board game together. I did miss this kind of small town interactions with random people for a long time and I really enjoyed that.  Needless to say,  everything was so clean!!!  The bathroom was just so cute and so clean. I could even drink and eat in the bathroom if I had to. It was that great. :D"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPogkm02lu9VT3t6Jp8p6DgecKKrNuQjzXa4gyT\u0026fid=0x0:0x5eb2a179490adbe2""],""When"":""2019-4-7""},{""Name"":""Katherine Crosbie"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWj_46fNbdhfY1fiDVDqSC0V3ehgO_hRf_cyUUX_dvudJa8IjLVdA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Neat local find.

The food was overwhelmingly salty and dominated by an overpowering taste of raw garlic—so much so that it felt like we had consumed an entire pod each. Despite the higher-than-average prices, the portions were small, and the quality of the food was dreadful.\n\nTo make matters worse, we found a strand of hair in one of the dishes. When we reported it to the staff, the response was shockingly dismissive—just a brief apology and the plate taken away, with no replacement or compensation offered.\n\nThe aftermath was even more distressing. All four of us felt nauseated after the meal and ended up needing medical attention at the hospital. We even informed the staff about how poorly the food was prepared, but no steps were taken to address our concerns.\n\nThe food is served rather fast which is good, but what’s the point if it’s tastes awful.\nI rarely speak poorly about food, but this experience was nothing short of a nightmare. We won’t be returning—it's simply not worth the risk to one's health.\n\nWe were very disappointed with our experience. There was no effort to offer a replacement or ask if we were satisfied with the food. In fact, there was no one available to address our concerns—the staff disappeared inside and didn’t return until most people had already left. The music was turned off while we waited and waited to give our review, despite being the only customers in the restaurant and someone with one small\nShawarma. That alone should have been a red flag, but we wanted to support a new local business and give it a try.\n\nAs for the claim that we “licked our plates clean,” this is completely false. Half the food was left untouched because it was simply inedible. We didn’t raise our concerns at the time because no one was there to talk to, and we overheard what sounded like an argument coming from the kitchen. There were only two staff members—a chef and someone taking orders—which is fine if the service is handled well, but it wasn’t.\n\nWe also have photos to support our feedback, so this isn’t just baseless criticism. Your response, however, lacks the courtesy of a sincere apology. Instead of addressing the issues, you've resorted to blaming the customer. Offering a replacement wouldn’t have helped in this case—we wouldn’t want to risk ending up in the hospital, longer.\n\nFor future reference, disappearing on customers, turning off the music, and essentially forcing them to leave hungry, upset, and feeling ignored is not acceptable. If you had apologized properly and been honest in your response, I might have considered taking down my review after some time. However, your false arguments have only made things worse. Also, regarding your portions—when the food served is a quarter of what’s shown in the advertisements, what do you expect? No one can even get a proper taste before complaining with such misleading presentation. Then u would have replied -  you’ll didn’t eat enough to know its real taste. We were polite enough not to complain about the taste or other issues up to that point, even though we were quite disappointed. However, finding a hair in the food crossed the line. When we finally pointed it out, the staff's response was a dismissive \""Sorry, guys,\"" as they took the plate away. There was no effort to address the situation properly or make amends.\n\nBad after taste, falling sick and now this..we don’t have any familial animosity to blame you unnecessarily…\nNot going to reply any further, it’s just waste of my time and shows on your part you’ll aren’t even sorry."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sikander H"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWNmjTEd9_FxsAT4gVm8dv1nbtMnnm5nSfmZM0TUcGYU3YUn4kC=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is some of the best middle Eastern food I've had.

not appreciate my comments as the Five Corners Café is already a pretty busy place, but I think it is one of the best breakfast places I’ve ever been to.  I love the fact that it is a classic family run cafe that means they care about the food and their customers.  The breakfast we had; a Spanish omelette and Huevos Rancheros, were some of the best versions I have ever seen, and the flavours were authentic.  The coffee seems bottomless as my son and I sat there for over an hour and the waitress just kept topping us up.  I understand it has a cadre of loyal regulars and I understand why.  It is what we all want in a local café: great food, good coffee, and a cozy place to hang out with family and friends.  You know a place has a loyal following when there is a wall of longtime customers’ photos on the wall.  I will be back soon, and hope to become a loyal fan."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP1kxWojhygJ2jqo4TWlVZFVnjy_Pt1pPFlfx7T\u0026fid=0x0:0x7a550edff6cfb2ec""],""When"":""2024-8-9""},{""Name"":""D.

Additionally, we waited for about 10min after ordering to ask our waitress if we were to fetch our own water or if they were going to bring it to our table. The service is really slow, but like I said they are still working out the kinks of a newly established location.\n\nIn terms of the actual food flavors, the nachos and the barbacoa gringas are absolutely delicious 🤤 but the tacos are try-hards and you end up with a heavily greasy mess.

extension of the Bahn mi Tres Bon in Richmond. Same owner, slightly different menu but overall just a wonder. The restaurant has a nice overall theme and decor. Gentle blues, nice whites, it leans into its french accents a lot. Just like Richmond they have a number of character pieces scattered around the restaurant (an old white wood tea cart, local art, and more) all designed to make you feel comfortable. It has a larger view of the kitchen and you can see them prep from the booths and front area.\n\nFood is delicious. The pho is always rich with the 24 hour broths. The bahn mi is great and filling. They also have a number of spring and salad rolls that are great to try. My kids have the mini flight that is a small spicy beef bahn mi with a small chicken pho. They still have the macarons up front and my kids love picking them out as a desert.\n\nIts great to sit here. Sometimes it can be a bit chilly on a rainy day but pleasant to just while away your time in. Bathrooms are clean and the overall establishment feels friendly and well maintained. The sounds of the restaurant and nearby diners never really seems to intrude on my thoughts.\n\nParking is available from the mall the restaurant it is in, or from the street nearby (usually full but you can get lucky). There are bike racks and it is on a bus line route. A fairly easy walk if you are anywhere in white rock."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPiwZC9-1-Y6-2Te0V3ameur9M1CvNoS04Oh3ms\u0026fid=0x0:0x2a8cf15f9e78e86e""],""When"":""2024-11-16""},{""Name"":""Keresna Bradley"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVFL4Gy14bplhQhEXbmVpDttucEOZGeSD1VNXBGULacoWk5Vv4=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""From start to finish this is the best dining experience I have had in ages!

warning for others. A few days ago, I went to this restaurant again and ordered food. A lady at the counter told me to come back in 15 minutes to pick it up. I ordered biryani and requested it to be mild, but when I got home and started eating, it was extremely spicy. I could only eat a few bites before I had to stop. She clearly misunderstood my request and made the dish way too spicy for me. Now, a week later, I’m still dealing with a skin allergy reaction caused by the chili. In my opinion, she should work more attentively, with a better and happier attitude, as she has a responsibility in her job. I’d prefer to take back the stars I gave them, and I won’t be returning, nor will I recommend this place to anyone ever again!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOVJlmRvj88hy_PL2Krg0lZ0kugKnEeqRBA2SbE\u0026fid=0x0:0x1563393f3bb708ff""],""When"":""2024-5-23""},{""Name"":""DR.

The fresh and delightful selection of sushi and sashimi was simply unparalleled, leaving us with a memorable culinary experience each time.\n\nHowever, as of late, we have noticed a slight shift in the dynamics of the restaurant. The prices of some of their signature fish dishes seem to have soared, making the overall dining experience somewhat costlier than before. With this, we find ourselves contemplating our orders more carefully, opting for more budget-friendly options and occasionally compromising on our usual indulgences.\n\nMoreover, the growing popularity of aburi-style sushi in many other establishments has taken a toll on Taka's clientele. While the allure of perfectly seared fish and the play of flavors has captivated many, it has also led us and others to explore these alternative sushi spots, drawing us away from our once-beloved haunt.\n\nAnother factor that has subtly impacted our preference for Taka is the noticeable decrease in available seating. Previously, securing a table was relatively hassle-free, but now it seems like a challenge. Perhaps the combination of loyal patrons and the restaurant's modest space has led to this spatial constraint, affecting the overall comfort and convenience of dining there.\n\nNonetheless, despite these recent changes, Taka remains a place with fond memories, and we might still return for special occasions or when we crave the unique flavors that only they can offer. Yet, for now, we find ourselves exploring other Japanese eateries in search of new culinary delights and dining experiences."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMScyHJi_-50cymwxxi8fkW3Ff-CncaXAand8UW\u0026fid=0x0:0x5f714bea561324be""],""When"":""2023-7-18""},{""Name"":""J D"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6nRf7-C791e6o74FBgXg6jbRwc2Hxzd8_Qc8MsQZfN7gcSFxvgQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Very fresh sushi with a team of professionals creating the experience!

The dessert consisted of jello (nice to see pineapple flavour), strawberry and cantaloupe, and of course fortune cookies. I wouldn't call it authentic Chinese food, more westernized. Run by a family, with the wife being the main cook in the back, as she was coming in and out to check on the buffet food.

I don’t know with so many other options for coffee around here, you’re much better off going down a block to island cafe or just across the street to grounds and greens, or up to pelican rouge or even Starbucks.

They make a lovely mocha and latte. And finally, the baking. Oh my word... I wish I had taken more home with me.  The cruffin, I'll be dreaming about it.

French croissant’s are a fine art to make and these for me fall within that baking realm. These was golden brown, great dry crust that snapped open to reveal the moist butter inside with too many layers to count. The Aman was much the same except with a caramelized, not gooey topping= excellent. Had my routine skinny cappuccino  which was smooth not bitter, served at the right temp with lots of foam. They serve a breakfast sandwich but save that for next visit.

The treats looked delicious and were very reasonably priced, so we decided to give them a shot. Let me tell you, it was the best decision we made that day.\n\nWe both ordered a little breakfast pastry with egg, bacon, and tomatoes, and shared a sweet berry tart. Both were on par with some of my favorite bakeries in Vancouver. We spent the next half hour sitting on their patio, trying to make eye contact with random passersby to encourage them to come in and support this newly opened gem.\n\nGreat vibe, super kind staff, reasonably priced, and most importantly – delicious food and coffee.

disappointed me so much that I'm writing my first review. I’ve been a regular customer here, often ordering once or twice a month because my family and I have loved Pizza Hut for over four years. I usually spend about $50 per order. But in the last few months, my orders have consistently been ruined, leading me to finally decide that I won’t order from this Pizza Hut again.\n\nWhen they offered fries (they don’t anymore), they were often soggy, too few, or even the wrong type — once I got waffle fries instead of regular ones that was not even in the sides option until now, and there were only nine pieces. I tried to be patient and gave them several chances before writing this review, but things haven’t improved.\n\nThe pizza crust hasn’t been crispy in months, and today’s pizza was a disaster.

The calamari was lightly breaded and cooked well though it wasn't very crispy and did need salt.\n\nThe desserts were not worth it for the price.\n\nThe Ek mek was boring but it tasted alright, it was described as having a crust that turned out to be kind of a soggy cake that was indiscernible from the custard, the 'roasted almonds' were not roasted and the cinnamon topping overpowered it.\n\nThe creme caramel was fine, it tasted good and had a coin sized amount of whipped cream on-top. It was a little smaller than a pudding cup but they charged $6.75 for it which seemed steep.\n\nThe servers were great! Friendly and attentive\n\nOverall we won't be back, we were disappointed but understand that they're just catering to the demographic of the area (elderly white people.)\n\nI hope this restaurant brings more flavour to their menu in the future as it's unfortunate that such a prominent restaurant in South Surrey is as boring as it is.

There was a line but they moved through everyone fairly quickly, as well all the flavors of ice cream are well labeled. I thought it was hilarious they offer a double cone advertising you can have 3 different scoops, one in each side of the cone yet the photo shows 2 scoops of the same floor. Our group had a variety of cones and bowls. I'm not sure what the difference is between the kids double scoop and adults double? I guess the size. The only disappointment was the waffle bowl that had the chocolate and crushed nut rim. The chocolate tasted old and gross, Mayne the nuts too were rancid? With it being summer and the place open to the heat outside I assume the stuff goes bad quickly. I wouldn't get that particular waffle bowl again because it went right in the garbage."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kate D"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWucZ5Kjxx4x-E5tJFk6phmF701csH13_pOauHoiwFMtKRubzIc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Went just before closing no lines.

Best ice cream! and you get a lot of ice cream for your money being down on the main strip.
