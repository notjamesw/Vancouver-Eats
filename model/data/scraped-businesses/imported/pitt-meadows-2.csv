She has been talking about it since so we decided to order there tonight as there aren't many local options that will accommodate her.\n\nI spoke to the PAC person and she told me the ginger garlic sauce was gluten free and showed the email from the manager confirming this. I went on the website to order but this sauce doesn't exist in the build your own bowl so I called. During the call, I told the person who answered about our school and gluten free and she confirmed the ginger garlic sauce was the one. I said I would call back with the rest of our order.\n\nLess then 5 minutes later I called back and I said \""okay I will get one of those ginger garlic with chicken and rice\"" then I ordered the rest of our meals. She said ok, it would be ready in 25-30 min. I told her my name and said my husband would be picking up and gave her name. This was not a rushed conversation. She had lots of time to clarify anything.\n\nSo my husband went in time to pick it up. He forgot his phone at home. I noticed it was taking super long to come back. When he finally arrived he told me that when he went to pick it up, the lady told him that she knows I wanted gluten free but nothing I ordered was gluten free. He said that was weird but paid anyway and left. He then had to go to a different restaurant to pick up something else for my daughter, spending more money and taking more time.\n\nWhen he got home and told me, I called back and was told I ordered a different dish. I said if that was the case, and you knew I was ordering gluten free since I just spoke to her and I told them it was me asking about the gluten free, why did she not confirm with me at the moment of ordering instead of waiting for when my husband went to pick up? Even if he had confirmed that was wrong, he would have had to wait for them to remake the dish. It would have made much more sense for everyone if she just confirmed when I ordered instead of not saying anything, especially since I kept saying gluten free. I am not the expert of their menu, they are.\n\nShe kept essentially blaming my husband and kept condescendingly saying \""I understand\"" (sounded like this was their training, because it was clear she did not understand). She offered no solutions so I ended the call. She called back and I chose not to answer. In the voicemail, she said she would make it no extra charge and we can go pick it up. But this isn't really a solution since 1. We already paid for the one they made that wasn't gluten free 2. I already spent extra having to get an alternate meal for her 3. It would have taken even more of my time to wait for it to be made and then drive back. Personally, I think they should have offered a refund or a coupon for the cost of the meal at the very be least.\n\nAs for the meal we got, those of us could eat it felt it was all just okay. Good value for money. It's a big serving. Had the customer service been good we would have tried again as it is good value for money.\n\nBad customer service combined with just okay food means we won't be repeat customers."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Erik Ostensen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKQpXi3wqlUgDP12KMcq1OauP6eTj3rkSzpWb3LA9l6F_pUCw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I work in the area and go here for lunch very often.

I held back on writing this review for a while because i don’t like writing bad reviews, but in this case because there are so many 5* reviews (which I myself mistakenly trusted before coming here), I feel it my duty to share my experience.\n\nI walked in an hour before closing. The space/atmosphere was initially nice and cozy. However within minutes of being seated, there were several employes buzzing and rushing hurriedly around creating an uncomfortable rushed feeling that they all wanted to get out of there.\n\nThe waitress greeted me promptly, was very friendly and polite throughout service. Sadly, the great service cannot compensate for the horrible food. Everything i ate tasted unfresh and bad, even the water tasted off.\n\nI ordered the beef teriyaki dinner box. First arrived water which had a strange unpleasant taste - how water can taste bad…i don’t know. Then came a complimentary “thing” (see photo) which was a nice touch and pleasant surprise. I call it a “thing” because I was not told what it was when it was brought to the table. Its taste was ok at first until I tasted dirty burnt frying pan. If you look at the photo you can actually see the burnt gunk on its edges. I’m not one to be ungrateful and complain about free things, but this was bad. The miso soup was the worst miso soup I’ve ever had (and I’ve had a lot in my life). It was lukewarm, watery, tasteless and had only 2 tiny pieces of green onion and no tofu whatsoever. The ebi sunomo arrived next. This tasted ok but the shrimp did not taste fresh and kind of grossed me out. The beef teriyaki was the worst. It came in a foul liquid instead of a sauce and believe it or not, tasted more like Chinese food than teriyaki. The gyoza, spring roll and tempura tasted good but old/unfresh. The salad was ok/standard. The dynamite roll was thick and packed but tasted fishy. I usually have a hard time taking food photos which convey the deliciousness of the food, but alas in this case the photos depict food which in reality tastes vile and unfresh. The friendly lady asks me “how was everything?” and of course I can’t say that everything tasted horrible, so i say “good, thank you”, what else can i say? I can’t very well complain about everything. I couldn’t finish my food and took the rest to go. I normally give leftovers to my dog but this time I wouldn’t because I didn’t want to risk him getting sick.\n\nI really am sorry to have to write a bad review for a local business. If this was a matter of slight taste preference, portion size, slow service or mistakes, I never would have written this review. However, when they serve me food that is this unfresh and old (who know how many hours or days old), they knew exactly what they were doing and such a thing cannot be rectified or explained away. Unless you have so little respect for your customers that you think they can’t tell the difference between old stale food and fresh food. I would not eat this food again if they were giving it away for free. And I’m the least picky eater ever, I’ll eat just about anything and be content. The service was friendly though…what a shame…"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP5r1mKxcRKBTg3bUDBvKDadIIChvLw_8dqYB8j\u0026fid=0x0:0x380b4b119dbe1d59""],""When"":""2024-8-15""},{""Name"":""Mandy Ouellett"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJKq9lp3Y1LfcLTPRaesiXyjPP6C2jhRCHNKPvuDgywEv1cAQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is my second time eating here and honestly it’s very good.

No matter what time of day or day of the week, and no matter what I order, I’m always completely satisfied. The food is consistently delicious and fresh, the service is always exceptional, and the prices are very reasonable. My favourites are the Dynamite roll and the gyozas, (especially the veggie gyoza, it’s sooooo delicious). I highly recommend Sushi House!\n**********\nOriginal Review:\nI recently visited Sushi House and was very impressed by the exceptional customer service, the delicious food at an unbeatable price, and the clean and inviting atmosphere.  I highly recommend this place!\n\nWhen I entered, I was immediately greeted by the warmest, sweetest lady and by a friendly chef. I sat down and was brought a menu immediately. I asked for a glass of water which arrived instantly. I ordered the dyna-cali lunch combo special (dynamite roll, California roll and miso soup). You can’t find a better price for this combo anywhere. I hope they will keep this special.\n\nAs I waited for my food (which was not very long), I admired the space. It is the perfect welcoming atmosphere; very tidy, everything is precisely in its place, the decor is minimal and warm. But the level of cleanliness makes this place stand apart. I don’t think I have ever seen a restaurant this clean, it was spotless. There was not so much as a crumb on the floor, a streak on the table or a smudge on a glass, the place was immaculately clean.\n\nThe food arrived fast (but not rushed clumsily). The presentation was beautiful and clean just like the restaurant. The food was delicious and clearly made with love and attention to detail. The miso soup was flavourful and warm, the California roll and dynamite rolls were both fantastic and perfectly rolled. I especially enjoyed the dynamite roll; it was phenomenal.  The lady was attentive and checked on me the perfect amount and exactly as much as I needed/wanted her to without being overbearing.\n\nAs I ate, I overheard some “difficult customers” (you know, the type who want to power trip on others to compensate for the lack of control they have over their own meaningless existence). Customers making numerous ridiculous requests like “no green onions is the miso soup, no vegetables in the sushi and so on, and on…). The lady (owner/employee) dealt with them and their ridiculous demands so politely, without argument, and with so much grace and kindness (which they did not deserve).

Each plate is a work of art, meticulously arranged to please both the eyes and the palate. The vibrant colors and thoughtful garnishes enhance the overall dining experience, making each dish as visually appealing as it is delicious.\n\nThe quality of the food at Akasaka matches the high standards set by the restaurant’s ambiance and presentation. The flavors are authentic and fresh, providing a true taste of Japan. However, it’s worth noting that the pricing here is relatively high compared to its contemporaries. Despite this, they do offer a decent lunch special, which provides good value and allows diners to enjoy their exquisite cuisine at a more affordable price.\n\nFor those in Pitt Meadows looking for a restaurant that offers great food in a beautiful and cozy setting, Akasaka is the perfect choice.

Sorry, but if this is the new Opa, we won’t be coming back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOHx655DAeR5IbC8mSd98gzD0HG0LFsRKt49OSA\u0026fid=0x0:0xcfa8ed77d3d81b9d""],""When"":""2022-2-26""},{""Name"":""Venus Rose"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUga1tlnNWpQarzUfwUA73NevowzuEV7nhR91bSOMQ419geC12m=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""This location is particularly not good.

But I don't understand why - when I make a mobile order - I can't add a special request. Most restaurant app systems give customers the opportunity to leave a modification instruction - for example, the McDonald's app lets me add a special request for \""tea bag out\"". The Starbucks app lets me reduce my tea bag count from 2 to 1. It's so simple! And I am a customer who really appreciates that feature. I'll tell you why. I prefer my tea very lightly steeped. But if I order an XL specialty tea at Tims, it automatically comes with 2 tea bags in the cup. And that makes the tea too dark for me. If I could add a comment, I could ask for one bag in, one bag out, and my problem would be solved. Will Tim's please consider adding a customer comment box on the mobile app? Pretty please?"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ajay Dey"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVCHZX-_MApTrC08ZgHKSTfZDWiMKP2cK1tf7nWAJOttsl_HDBv=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""The most disgusting food a restaurant can serve, such a shame!\n\nWent to grab a quick meal, got the habanero chicken bowl and steeped tea, surprisingly the drink and bowl was served in less than 30 seconds, after driving away with the food I realized that the bowl had rotten lettuce and the chicken was so mushy as though someone already chewed it and spat it out.

This place is so poorly mismanaged. Drive-through customers get first priority and walk-in customers are forgotten about. Walked to this location from my shop to grab a coffee. I had one person in front of me and 3 people behind me. I made a mental note of the time when I walked inside. It took 10 full minutes to help the customer in front of me and for them to prepare my coffee. Every customer in the lineup was very vocal and talked out loud about how there was nobody serving them.  There were no less than 5 people working in the drive-through and 1 person helping in-store customers. I asked to speak to the manager and I was talked down to by a lady who just made excuse after excuse about staffing. I watched no less than 17 cars get served before I got my coffee. It pains me but I drive my truck through the drive-through now instead of taking the 2-minute walk.  Better yet I'm just going to Waves Coffee on the other side of the lot, at least they care.\n\nEdit:\n\nWent through the drive-through at 5:10 a.m. and got my coffee and breakfast wrap. I could see and hear the manager making my wrap when I pulled up to the window.  She asked   her employee why isn't the grill on, to which he mumbled something. He then proceeded to come to the window and tell me the grill was not working. I asked him, Is it not working or did you not turn it on? he just smiled and said it would be 10 minutes for it to heat up. Frustrated I just grabbed my now cold wrap and left....\n\nApparently, I give too many chances to local businesses. Ordered a large turkey, bacon club. this was the lettuce they put on my sandwich. It is very evident this location has ZERO care in the world.

Not only did she make special accommodations for our family that were quite difficult to work with she also made sure that the entire experience from arranging the evening, presenting sample menus that would please the family was ready the day of. Lynn is a gem and so are her staff that she has handpicked! The food was fantastic and everyone was impressed by the quality and selection. We are a pretty particular bunch when it comes to our meals and not one complaint was had. I would not hesitate to recommend Ban Chok Dee in Maple Ridge to anyone who is looking to book a venue for a special event.

I have gone to this place twice so far, and both times, it has not disappointed me. As a peruvian born, I must say this restaurant has the very traditional and authentic flavor of peruvian food. During my 5 years living here,  this is the only restaurant where I could feel it. The outstanding and remarkable dishes are the causa tasting and lomo saltado, which are perfectly cooked. Also, the fish ceviche was delicious. I was so surprised how the chicha morada is well done, you can feel the real purple corn flavor mixed with the cinnamon and the right level of sweetness. The ingredients are fresh, the dishes have the right amount of portion, prices are ok, the staff is friendly, and it is super worth it. The first time I went with my husband was for lunch and he enjoyed it, he was the only one who tried the dessert (lucuma tres leches) cause I did not have any more room, he liked it everything. The second time, I went with a friend who never tried before peruvian food, and she loved it. I would definitely try to go again and get other dishes from the menu.

Two of which were family members from out of town that we recommended this spot to, because usually it’s good.\nHowever, this trip left us feeling disappointed.\nUpon entering the restaurant, there was no hostess around so we waited for about 10 minutes until someone noticed and we got seated. We were given menus but not approached by our waitress for another 10 minutes. We kept it simple— ice waters, a coffee, a juice and a hot chocolate without whipped cream. Again, we waited an additional 10 minutes, before the waitress came back missing a majority of the order. The waters were missing and the hot chocolate contained whipped cream— which was asked not to be put on. The waitress instead of simply saying I made a mistake, just proceeded to say we spoke incorrectly and she was just following what was asked.\n\nAnother few minutes, waters came out and so did the next hot chocolate, by a different waitress. The hot chocolate was terrible— hardly any actual chocolate in it and mostly lukewarm water. Had to flag down our waitress who seemed to be avoiding our table, and again didn’t address the mistake, just proceeded to call it ‘odd’. So, gave up on that beverage and ordered another different one.\n\nFood came out and was decent— though not worth the price. The bacon was poorly cooked and hardly edible, the potatoes were bland, and the coffee wasn’t great.\n\nAll in all, the lesson learned from this would be to pay more attention to your customers, specially when an allergen is mentioned, and apologize for any mistakes made instead of making it a big deal.\n\nWould think twice about coming back to this particular DeDutch. 😕"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""N nova"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKVwkmAucI_zKw-myeb5xINxQiGjdUygLuG8oftGwvM-DLxuQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""The pancake (pancake comes with sausage, bacon, eggs, ham, and hash browns).

Coachman for the first time. I had an overall enjoyable experience and I highly recommend this local gem!\n\n•VIBES/ATMOSPHERE\nThe atmosphere was laid back and the place has a fantastic old school pub feel (which is exactly the way I like a pub to be). They also have a lovely patio with some misty water spray to keep you cool in the summer. I didn’t sit on the patio, but it sure looked nice.\n\n•SERVICE\nThe service was excellent. The waitress (the very tattooed young Asian lady) was fantastic. She was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, super fast, and made me feel welcomed and comfortable. She checked on me the exact correct number of times (I get annoyed by waitresses who repeatedly pester, this one had good instincts and was on point). My order was taken immediately and my drink/food arrived fast. As a smoker who has no incentive to aimlessly hover in/around a pub with no smoking areas, speed of service is very important to me.\n\n•DRINKS\nThey have a pretty extensive drink menu with lots of choices. The variety of cocktail choices impressed me as a cocktail drinker. I ordered the Blue Hawaiian. While it was more teal-green than blue and not as sweet as my sweet tooth alcohol taste desires, you couldn’t taste the alcohol but could feel it. And that is everything a successful cocktail should be. I will definitely have to be back to try more of their summer cocktails (and ask for them to be extra sweet!)\n\n•FOOD\nI noticed other people eating burgers and being the nosy follower that I sometimes can be, I thought I’d go for the burger special. But when the waitress said the burger is a regular burger, I decided to order the calamari instead (my burgers need to be irregular otherwise I’m bored, there’s a limit to my sheepish follower behaviour after all). The calamari was delicious! It was warm, fresh, crispy, flavourful and a large portion. The tomato \u0026 green onion salsa that came with it was sour and salty; tasty and refreshing. The sauce was also delicious, although if you dip every calamari piece, you will run out of sauce on your last 3 pieces. I recommend they add a tiny bit more sauce to ensure that all calamaris are successfully dipped. This calamari was the crispiest calamari I’ve ever had in my life, which was a pleasant surprise. Even the squeezed juice from my lemon and the tomato pieces didn’t and couldn’t make this calamari soggy. I bet you could pour buckets of water on this calamari and it wont lose its crunch. A waterproof non-soggy calamari. It seems I have searched my entire life for such a thing. And now I’ve finally found it!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOH4AERpkElu4yTZKq9vFJ3c1y1W2XvEbIAHOyN\u0026fid=0x0:0xd08aec90d2675cc2""],""When"":""2024-7-29""},{""Name"":""Christopher Adams"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXcL5bNZ-lkkKT4gy1k5l3D2BvEp2MJobsZwK2jpBW_3saF1nbleg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Great place, really good food and service, plenty of options to eat and drink.

We then sat at a small dirty table, that was sprayed while we sat there and not wiped down fully. We were then asked if we are vegan or not, we said vegetarian, and the employee flatly asked us again if we are vegan or not. We said no, vegetarian. We were given meat menus, then waited a while and heard this employee lightly argue and correct a customer on the phone, then did the same to the couple that walked in after us. Thankfully those customers corrected her arrogance to ensure they get the right food with their dietary restrictions. We then asked for the vegan menu and got a snappy “oh you want vegan now?” Then received a very dirty vegan menu.\n\nI work customer service, so normally I don’t really mind if someone is having an off day.

The bacon was chewy (how I like it) and flavorful. The toast was just right.\n\nWhat truly sets Whisky Charlie apart from all other cafés is the exemplary service. The staff were very attentive and visited my table often to check up on my needs. They were also extremely personable and talkative which made them an absolute pleasure to interact with. Even if the food was lacking (which it certainly is not) I would make an effort to go back just for the service!\n\nThe ambiance of the café was excellent. Watching the planes take off and land provided a level of entertainment no other café can match. I think the only thing that could improve it is if there was music playing.\n\nIn summary, if you're hungry for breakfast Whicky Charlie is the place to be.

I got a new sandwich and this time there was only lettuce and bacon on it. So I drove back through, and the lady that gave me the food said they were out of tomatoes… I was surprised that that wouldn’t have been mentioned since it’s a pretty big part of a BLT. Honestly, I don’t even think it was true I believe she just wanted to get rid of me at that point. Anyways, she gave me a refund- for the egg BLT. So I made a dollar for wasting half an hour of my time. The times they’ve actually got it right here my BLT has been burnt or soggy. I won’t even bother with the manager because they will probably replace them when they realize business is down 1000% percent due to lack of consistency. I worked at McDonald’s for four years and this place is a joke, my boss would have scalped us if we ran the place like that.

The wings were fine, but the service absolutely tanked. It was a louder night, but not over all super busy. We were sat for over 30 minutes before seeing a waitress, she finally took our drink order and didn’t come back for another 25. If we had seen her running around the restaurant, we would’ve been more inclined to be more patient, as we understand things get busy. She passed us several times, each time without our drinks which could’ve easily been placed on her tray and dropped off. She’d run past our table, tap it and say she was grabbing whatever we had asked for or to take our order, but would take nearly 30 minutes each time to come back. We saw her maybe 3 times, and what should’ve been a quick in and out for some wings, we were there almost 3 hours, had only 1 drink refill and nothing else, never asked us if we needed anything, and you couldn’t catch her otherwise. Also, they cease to mention that pop refills are not free on Wednesdays, which seems like a scam to get you in the end. While it’s just pop, I understand, be upfront with customers so they can decide what they want to do with that information. It wasn’t until we asked for the bill (3 different times) that she finally came and had a second to stop and chat, to which she instantly brought up her children and Christmas coming, which to us felt like tip baiting. Terrible experience, which tanks because the atmosphere seemed like it could be fun, and the food (wings at least) wasn’t bad."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""John"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWw5rMQatibni75tbNpjJbP4ehPrGlbmCLKvcJ6Naf176pomyyjJw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I have never been to \""The Reach\"" before.

However, our day took an unfortunate turn on the 9th hole when we were approached by a member of your pro shop staff, conveying a message from the General Manager, Frank Asin. The message was delivered abruptly and without any prior warning, instructing us to leave the premises due to our use of a power cart on the fairways.\n\nThis incident left me feeling embarrassed and disappointed, as I had not encountered such a situation in my previous golfing experiences. Subsequently, I sought resolution by contacting the general manager,  Frank Asin multiple times, leaving voicemails and messages on his office number and cell number also with the operator. Regrettably, I have not received any response, adding to my frustration.\n\nAfter patiently waiting for few days, I contacted your operator again and was directed to speak with another Manager Craig. While he explained Frank is unavailability, he assured me that a return call would be made. Unfortunately, it has now been more than ten additional days since that conversation, and I have yet to receive any communication.\n\nI find it disheartening that, not only were we not provided with a warning regarding power cart usage, but also that we were asked to leave without any attempt at direct communication from the general manager himself. My misunderstanding regarding the usage of power carts on the fairway during winter was an honest mistake, and I would have appreciated the clarification.\nAdditionally, the lack of refund for the remaining holes, considering we paid for a full 18-hole experience with a power cart, adds to the overall disappointment.\n\nIn light of this experience and the subsequent lack of response, I have felt compelled to share my disappointment through this formal complaint on Google reviews. I believe a more proactive approach in addressing customer concerns is crucial for the reputation of Meadows Garden Golf Course.\n\nI sincerely hope that this matter can be resolved amicably, and I await your prompt attention to this complaint."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNw8weBwdQS5IBbrhv5hcS5cS-gMZphdsPBsg6e\u0026fid=0x0:0x25b71be32091db8d""],""When"":""2023-12-29""},{""Name"":""Billy Pun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVxA8SQnjh81Oc1tSXA8i55tQgrYEuatUiCZm-PW0Tq2l6FnVv8-w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The staffs are very welcoming and the course is great.

We ordered a large half pepperoni half cheese with garlic jalapeno aioli, sriracha ranch, and garlic parm cheesy bread sticks. The pizza crust was some weird philo-pastry/pita bread/uncooked dough mix. I don't get it. The bottom of the crust had separated from the rest of the pizza so, the bottom was well-done and the part that had separated was undercooked. The cheese was so thick and hardened by the time we got it home. I ate two slices because I was hungry (generally food tastes better when you're hungry but not this time) but I threw the rest out. I hate throwing out food and leaving bad reviews because I appreciate local businesses, but this pizza was poorly made.

I asked him when he was coming back because I can’t sit here and wait all night, and he said “oh, I’ll come right now.” HE WASN’T EVEN PLANNING ON COMING AT THAT TIME!

I hope your as excited as I am.\n\nPaliotti’s in Maple Ridge- only one other Italian restaurant to choose from\n\nDressing: creamy base, with a nice lemon coating, heavy garlic (yum), fresh ground pepper and anchovies. Can’t believe I’m saying this but maybe too much sauce.  Definitely tastes homemade though.\nLettuce: romaine, cold and crisp, however cut too large\nCroutons: out of a package\nCheese: questionable? Powdered parm on top but within the dressing a thicker heavier tasting cheese I couldn’t figure out.\nBacon: none- which is honestly how I prefer my Caesar’s. Bacon seems to over power the sauce and texture (to me)\n\nI went to this restaurant after 8 years of my mom passing away with my girlfriend. My mom always ordered penne alla vodka. I was searching all over Maple Ridge and could not find it on the menu. This place seemed the most authentic and warm. We obviously has to order the Caesar salad, but I asked if they could do an alla vodka sauce but on my favourite… Gnocchi!\nSoooo tender, sauce missing pancetta but still very good and grateful I got to eat in my moms honour\n\nOverall, very authentic, great service and food came quick.

It is easily some of the best food in Maple Ridge. The only thing that needs work is the time to receive your food. We have been there a few times in the last month and the service is slow.

4.9 in Surrey and 4.6 in Maple Ridge on Google Reviews, I decided to give this highly praised Indian restaurant a shot—and it didn’t disappoint.\n\nFrom the moment you step inside, it feels like you’ve been transported to India. The ambiance is authentic and immersive, making the experience even more special. Following the waitress’s recommendations, we ordered their signature Lamb Korma paired with the famous Garlic Naan, as well as the classic Butter Chicken served with Fries.\n\nThe flavors were rich and aromatic, exceeding my expectations. The Lamb Korma had an incredible depth of spices, while the Butter Chicken was a perfect blend of creamy and tangy flavors. Every bite was flavorful and satisfying, making it easy to see why this place has such high ratings.\n\nWould I come back? Absolutely! For anyone who loves curry or is curious about Indian cuisine, USTAADJ 76 is worth every visit."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOuhE4PDtYS7uE0jxMzxCeKTR_v2nxsq6C4J1w4\u0026fid=0x0:0x6ccf4a3eef0094e4""],""When"":""2024-12-2""},{""Name"":""Harjot Singh Thiara"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUzOWwYq4K3U1PHL-O7BVjU4O_407b0Owm7Wzd6z3KttiPqwyct=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Hi all, I would like to explain my recent visit to Ustad G76, We were group of eight, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience.

She effortlessly memorized each member's order and the necessary amendments, ensuring that everything came out exactly as we requested.\n\nA big thanks to Chef Harjap, who did an amazing job in the kitchen and truly made our day special. We enjoyed a delightful spread that included Kadai Paneer, Chana Bhatura, Pav Bhaji, two Veg Thalis, Veg Noodles, Paneer Malai Tikka, and dessert. The portion sizes were generous, far better than what you often find at other restaurants, where you might feel shortchanged.\n\nDuring the meal, we all sampled each other's food and were consistently amazed by the flavours.

I called and made reservations for 530 for my family of 5\n\nFood takes a long time to arrive - we complained about how slow it was and the waitress said \""this is a 2 hour seating\"" and that's \""how the kitchen works\"". I could understand if it was fine dining but let's be clear, this is store bought pasta with home made sauces.\n\nMy three boys liked the marinara sauce and the pasta was cooked nicely.\n\nMy wife had the \""special\"" which was roasted chicken (two drum sticks and one thigh) for $29. No mention on the menu that it was only dark meat. She said it was ok and ate most of it but was also very hungry as we had been waiting nearly 1.5hrs for the food to come out.\n\nThe manager?owner?/chef? Went around to every table except ours to check in with customers. We heard him mention it was someone else's birthday and congratulated them - he made no mention to my son about it being his birthday even though it was specified in the reservation (whatever).\n\nThe worst part of the night was when I asked the manager?owner?/chef? About my carbonara sauce. The sauce was cooked improperly - carbonara is supposed to be silky smooth without any curdling of the eggs. My pasta basically had cream, oil and scrambled eggs on it. Apparently this is \""how we do it there\"".  When I explained that this is not what I was expecting and that it wasn't properly made he became very standoffish and rude. I had to ask to have it removed from the bill - which he did but not without his nasty entitled attitude.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, it was clean and cozy. There's not a lot of seating and I guess the only downsides are the very small washrooms (1 person per washroom) and the tables on the right side of the dining room are so close together that my 8 year old could barely fit between the chairs to get to the washroom.\n\nWe thought this would be a nice treat for my son's dinner as we are an Italian family but this was just a letdown on all accounts. Even with my main removed the bill was over $130 (for a glass of house wine, one app- the prawns were tasty, three plates of store bought pasta and my wife's \""special\"").\n\nWon't be back.\n\n***Edit: we ordered two sides of garlic bread and they never brought it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPLi9b1a6K79_tuyWX1dKP-SCvx_AKUQTTU8jjk\u0026fid=0x0:0xe2da073352bb98a3""],""When"":""2024-10-25""},{""Name"":""Monkey Couch"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKjBJae2rKS_uXWCMGu9-Vey95DYSzaWVHAACfGX9Lt21SDIw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Went here the first time with my husband and my friend for her birthday.

No special treatment at all.\n\nThe Cesar salad and house were good.  The food was subpar at best. Ordered the roasted chicken with Penne pasta.  Store bought pasta under cooked with no real sauce or flavour.  The chicken which I thought was in the pasta was roasted chicken on the side all brown meat thighs and drumstick.

The server came to our table shortly afterward and took our beverage orders, and discussed the evening specials. She left us with the menus and returned a short time later with our drinks.  She took our appetizer order and our main dinner orders, and my wife and I enjoyed the warm buns. Relatively quickly, our Caesar salad arrived, and we began our meal.  The timing on our main courses was perfect, and we had a short break between the completion of our salad and our main courses. I decided on the Penne Amatricana, and my wife had linguini Bolognese and meatballs.  The meatballs were about the size of a tennis ball and they were delicious.  My penne dish was also delicious, and I ate the leftovers the following day for lunch.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great Italian meal.

The \""salad\"" in the box is merely some brown iceberg lettuce with no dressing and one sliver of a shredded carrot. In the photo attached  the reddish colour of the lettuce is not the curry, it  is in fact the rotting of the lettuce itself. The curry I ordered is way too sweet, has mooshy and spongy tofu in it, and maybe 4 small chunks of bell pepper. I spent an extra dollar for coconut rice and my Curry is sweeter and tastes more like coconut than the rice... I don't know what the heck is going on, but I've had Thai red curry about 30 times and it has never been this bad.

This was not a chicken breast. And to charge a customer $4.00 for that is a complete rip off. I specifically asked foe no pickles because i dislike pickles with a passion so i make sure that i let them know. As you can see in the receipt it says no pickles but my chicken sandwich had pickles. Plenty. The tator tots were cold. We were eating in the parking lot and they were cold yet we waited at least 15 min. To get out meal which is no problem if the quality of foof is good. This was such a disappointment and we will not be wasting our money here again oe the new one you are getting ready to open in pitt meadows. I hope whoever is reading this reviews takes this feedback serious because you are a brand new bussiness and having so much negative feedback is not good. Do better.\nA year later let me add more. I emailed you guys and no one ever got back to me. My husband decided to give you guys a try again and this time it was even worst. You had 2 guys working there looking really dirty.

never had Korean fried chicken before and I kept hearing that this was the place to go. Words can’t describe how impressed I was but I’ll give it a shot.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and spacious and very well organized. There was only one person working (I’m assuming the owner) and he was very friendly and attentive. He also brought us a couple of glasses of water even though we did not ask for any which was very nice.\n\nWe decided to try 2 half orders of boneless chicken. One of their signature seasoned chicken and the other was the garlic pepper chicken. At $16.50 for a half order I have to say that they were massive portions! The chicken was boneless thigh meat in an insanely crunchy breading and tossed in these delicious, sweet and spicy sticky sauces. We managed to eat half of both and packed up the rest.\n\nThe chicken was hot, juicy, and stayed crunchy even after sitting in the sauce for a bit. This place is seriously amazing and I would recommend this to anyone. Can’t wait to come back and try their different flavours! I read in some reviews that the cream and onion flavour is good so will most likely try that one!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO_-4XpVXwS4tuiPw6wDS5_y5bBOxBRywq3CB-z\u0026fid=0x0:0x5a3b1015c27fd198""],""When"":""2024-11-24""},{""Name"":""Jessameen Dela Peña"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX9mRpmL8-ZJUG7UPFcnsjzRdxjABif-MswbO1rxgJyyWfns8Jd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""If you're a fan of Korean fried chicken, this place is a must-visit!

Got invited by friends to check out this quirky spot for all-you-can-eat Taco Tuesday, and I left with a pretty positive impression. Sure, the tacos are buffet-style, the simplest Tex-Mex you can imagine, but you can load up for just 11 bucks and change with no limit. Probably even better if you are having a few drinks too. But what really stood out to me was the saloon-style vibe and the farm surroundings, complete with scattered farm machinery and, the best part, horses! It’s simple, humble, and you won’t find many places like this around Metro Vancouver and close by. While the food might not blow your mind, at least in my experience, the atmosphere and the memories are totally worth the trip."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNg-SRzMYbykNFWD1NFF318L6Nb-fahQiO8vegw\u0026fid=0x0:0x1715fa59497ee645""],""When"":""2024-9-13""},{""Name"":""Mary Servant"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXHgLbeT0gou0iFPpk0IOFdoMBnJ7rC_3eS_v5DrAOPsTKPD22a=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I went down on Sunday for the first time for a meat draw that was a lot of fun.

The buffet offered a decent number of dishes, but the quality was hit-or-miss. For appetizers, there were only two options - tandoori chicken and samosa. Unfortunately, the tandoori chicken was dry and not impressive.\n\nThe main course had two chicken items, and the butter chicken was the highlight - it was flavorful and enjoyable. The vegetable mix was just average, and the rice was good. However, I was disappointed that they ran out of basic salad items like onions and cucumbers by 1:30 PM, and they didn't replenish them even after we asked. This was a letdown, especially since the buffet was supposed to be available until 3 PM.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience, and the price of $15 per person was reasonable.

Went for the Dinner Buffet. They have a lunch buffet every day I think. The dinner buffet is Friday through Sunday. Tasty food, seemed like good quality ingredients. With a nice variety of dishes. There was a lot of available seating and the place wasn't busy (2 other tables in use), which is why the service was kinda shockingly bad (there was a high staff to guest ratio). I think it might have been just bad luck, or maybe just the person responsible doesn't understand buffet service expectations. In my opinion, even at a buffet service is important. Plus it's an opportunity for the staff to earn tips to share with the kitchen etc. It would take much effort to really elevate the experience. Clearing the plates, bringing more water, asking if I wanted anything else to drink... I just didn't feel the care you want to feel eating out somewhere. Hope the owner / manager sees.

They’re always willing to connect and make the experience friendly and welcoming. Go there for dinner, you won’t be disappointed!\n\nEDIT - DECEMBER 2023: a few friends and I eat at Woking Dragon Chop Suey House in Maple Ridge once a week. We’ve been doing it just about every week for the last 18 to 24 months.  It’s our place - we even have our regular table.\n\nTonight was no different. We came in and sat. The server team brought us drinks without asking because they know what we order. They don’t usually even take food orders now because we order the same things each week.\n\nBut what WAS different tonight… is that when it came time to bring us the bill… they comped our entire table. They said “Merry Christmas” and comped us more than $80 in food to say thank you for our loyalty.\n\nThis was amazing. The profit margins are worse in restaurants than almost any other business. So for them to comp us all to say thank you, we recognize just how big a deal this was.\n\nThanks Woking dragon and staff. You folks are amazing.

The key to having a good meal here is knowing what to order as some items are a little bland tasting - as some reviews will tell you. The black pepper sauce is really tasty and you should try anything w that! Although we did not order any this time, their spicy salted prawns are also really good. In my opinion this restaurant does all things deep fried very well. Some restaurants have doughy chicken balls but not here.

I've been hearing so many raves about this place I had to check it out. I did not enjoy it but I went back a couple months later to give it a second chance. I thought they might have been having an off day since everyone else seems to like it. The second time it was just as bad.\n\n(Feb 2019) My first visit I ordered chow mein, chop suey, almond chicken, sweet and sour pork for take out. The food had zero flavor. It's like they didn't use any sauce, salt, msg, soy sauce or anything at all. The noodles were cooked perfectly. But it was like they cooked them and then did absolutely nothing to them. No sauce, no spice, no flavor. Completely naked bland noodles. So the texture was great. Same with the chop suey. The veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly. They were nice and crispy. But it tasted like boiled broccoli, cauliflower, celery and mini corn. No sauce, no salt, nothing at all added. I've had worse. Some restaurants make their noodles and veggies all soggy and mushy so I appreciate the crispness. But is it common for restaurants to add nothing to these things? Or maybe they did and I just couldn't taste it at all. It just tasted like water. The almond chicken was flavorless. It literally tasted like flour and water. Again no salt or msg or whatever it is that Chinese restaurants usually add to give it that zing of flavor. The quality of meat in the sweet and sour pork was good. Cooked very well again but no flavor again. Is this an msg free restaurant, did they run out of salt, did they forget to add sauce? I've not a fan of salt, I never add it to my food and I often find Chinese food to be heavy on the salty flavor. But I found this food inedible without drowning it in soy sauce which I don't usually do with takeout.\n\n(May 2019) Decided the give this another try, maybe they were having a bad day. Ordered the same thing for takeout plus Char Siu and ginger beef. The veggies and noodles had a bit a flavor this time but nothing special. So that's an improvement there. But the almond chicken was so undercooked. It was soggy and completely white. I'm used to almond chicken being slightly browned (almond colour). I had to pull out my deep fryer to brown and crisp the chicken for my family. The ginger beef was pretty good. I've give it 7/10. The Char Siu sounded amazing on the menu \""slowly oven roasted to perfection\"" but tasted like a chewy, tough pork chop. We ordered enough for 4 people. Usually all the food is gone with Chinese but most of it was left over. No one in the family was really into it.\n\nSo overall good quality meat and veggies but poorly executed. You don't get very much for the price and it seems a little high priced. The staff was nice both times I went in for pick up. Very young though and inexperienced. Several of the girls looked about 15 years old. I think it's great that they are offering students in the community their first jobs. Would I recommend this place? I don't know. I know I'm never going there again because I was not impressed. But the rest of the Chinese restaurants in Maple ridge and Mission are awful with soggy mushy food and gnarly meat. So by default it makes this place \""the best Chinese in town\"". I guess I'd say give it a try and decide for yourself. I'll leave you with this, at least it's not horrible...."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNeFbAAvRIofLTWXtjgDu2doO0v-0Zf3nJALha1\u0026fid=0x0:0x55b3ae1f8ffb622f""],""When"":""2021-4-1""}]",

I wouldn’t recommend getting oysters here.\nThe burger tasted sort of good but it is thick and on the dry side. The fish and chips seemed to be the only dish that was enjoyed with no complaints. The service was really friendly and accommodating, I feel for the servers as the kitchen is clearly struggling to provide quality dishes."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMuxMNOufg28u_6KGNZclsLjNfE_Troz9ZqaNiJ\u0026fid=0x0:0xdb1c783ecca39027""],""When"":""2024-8-30""},{""Name"":""MAY"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWaprK9T_y6Ya-MZ-gYNQwYVv0YO4LriJa7e6HtacNm__1Wvj4=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Ordered the halibut burger and fries.

You know the workers take pride in their food and service when they post the restaurant's review articles on the walls.\n\nI ordered the Osso Bucco with the Virgin Purple Sour drink. I was served complimentary bread with my entrée that included butter and a bottle of fermented garlic. The bread tasted pretty great on its own while the garlic made it taste much better. The Osso Bucco was delicious with the Bolognese sauce. The side pesto pasta was very good and was well seasoned with parmesan. The non-alcoholic Purple Sour tasted excellent with its exceedingly sweet flavours.\n\nThe servers were very formal with their customers when it comes to preparing their tables.

Glad to see it's still here and I'm visiting again after 20+ years. All I remember was that I liked their hot and sour soup.\n\nNot really an authentic Szechuan restaurant. 30 years ago, most chinese cuisines were cooked by hong kongers or south chinese people. So, most of these dishes are going to be a southern take on it.\n\nHot and sour soup - price is awesome. $11 enough for at least 6 bowls. Souo base is missing a bit of flavor but it is jam packed with ingredients.\n\nDrunken chicken - it was ok. Little on the salty side.\n\nShanghainese pan fried pork buns - these were probably the worst I've had. Not made in house and not properly pan fried. No juice, super dry, no fried bottom crust.\n\nBean curd wrapped pork dim sum - surprisingly this came out last. At least 20 min has passed. This is a steamed dish but it came out with dried edges like it was sitting on a dry heater. Taste was ok.\n\nMapo tofu - asked for extra spicy and extra numbing. Numbing was there but nowhere near real szechuan numbing. Was not spicy at all. Sauce was more oily than saucey.\n\nThe price point reflects the quality. Things are either mediocre or a complete miss. Would come again to try only the better stuff. Staff was friendly. Came to try to refill the tea way more times than normal. The iron goddess tea tastes much better than a lot of dim sum places elsewhere."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOsyXtmZVjFTpSM7j5XHpsMqasJjiN51hrkn9sk\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c85358e6c767e95""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""Sarah Grace"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX0P_FT3n0HZdmLMDEJ6UcRFNPyHbE7QJ8GW3gOL-SGGTFh-sFdQw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good Chinese food, some of the best we’ve tried!

Please read with that in mind.\n\nPreface: I tried to submit this complaint privately through their website 'contact us' page, however their feedback form only throws errors.\n\nThe manager or owner put up a sign stating that they wouldn't be accepting expired coupons anymore. That's fine, and totally fair. What isn't fine OR fair is that the sign subsequently blamed that change on a minimum wage increase, and suggested that the store wasn't profitable with the new wages. That's the work of a really, really bad leader. Simultaneously throwing employees under the bus to customers (\""don't be mad at me, the one who should be accountable for this decision, be mad at my minimum wage employees!\"") while also announcing your resentment over being forced to pay minimum wage to your staff? That's really upsetting. Can you imagine being an employee and knowing your boss doesn't even think you're worth minimum wage? How awful for employee morale and retention. I can tell you for certain that, if I worked there and saw that, my motivation to work hard would disappear.\n\nShame on the manager/owner who posted that sign. Seriously. The minimum wage workers are the only reason you HAVE a business. You owe ANY success you have to them, not the other way around.\n\nAs for the staff we interacted with, they were all lovely people who were absolutely doing their best while crazy busy and understaffed. I have only positive things to say about the staff.

The gravy was the worst part, it tasted weak and without season with a mediocre sweat flavor but warm I guess... it did not save the cold fries like I hoped. Not a waste of 20 dollars from my dad and I to share, but I probably would have chosen another place to eat if I knew then what I know now.\n\nI hope this KFC improves their standards in fast food and accept my honest review."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",
