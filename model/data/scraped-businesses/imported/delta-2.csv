I suspect the wings are par fried or pre cooked and then finished and sauced when ordered.  The reason I suspect this is the wings came out very quickly and there is no way they could have been fried from raw in that time. Anyway the wings, while warm when we got them were a bit overcooked.\nThe Bahn mi sandwich had fresh veggies but the meat (grilled pork) was a bit too grilled for its thickness and was a bit like jerky.  There was very little sauce/mayo and no pate (a usual part of a Bahn mi) so it made for an overall dry sandwich.\nFinally, the Bun Bo Hue was hot, spicy, full of flavour and had very generous amounts of meat and noodle!

Back in the beginning of October, we wanted Italian food for dinner. We also wanted to go somewhere that we had never been to before. A search brought led me to Illuminaté Restorante. We are extremely glad it did! So, a reservation was made.\n\nUpon entering, we immediately found Illuminaté Restorante to be a comfortable environment with a rustic Italian feel. Obviously, it is a popular place too. We can understand why.\n\nOur meal started off with the Grilled Romaine and the Grilled Calamari to share. Both were outstanding! The Roasted Garlic dressing was wonderful on the perfectly grill romaine. The Calamari was a surprising delight. The hints of orange and pickled fennel took this squid to another level. In a world, awesome!\n\nOur pasta mains were next level Italian cuisine. The Pappardelle al Ragu was by far on of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had. The Braised Angus Short Ribs and Mushrooms were in a sauce that was out of this world. As for the Spaghetti and Meatballs, one would think “What a basic dish.” This was far beyond basic. Whatever is in their “Family Recipe” is extremely flavourful and delicious. Best meatballs ever.\n\nOf course there was dessert. We shared the Citrus Crème Brule and the Mini Cannolis. The Lemongrass and Citrus was a great edition to this delicious custard. One cannot go to an Italian restaurant without having Cannolis. The Pistachio and Ricotta filling was superb. These mini cannolis rivals those of Mike’s Pastries of Boston.\n\nAnd then there’s the service. Marie took extremely good care of us. She is very knowledgeable about the menu when we had questions. In chatting with Marie, she told us how much she loves her job and what she does. It shows. It’s always a pleasure to have service like Marie’s when dining out.\n\nSo, would I recommend Illuminaté Restorante? Absolute! This is a gem of a restaurant that you don’t have to travel downtown to. We can’t wait to dine there again."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOXDTu5sqwygeUAS-YGuWvWI20XRqTq1z238hnD\u0026fid=0x0:0x15d7115c41800af7""],""When"":""2024-11-22""},{""Name"":""KAP Magnuson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVuEWJRpclnUBzUp95TdnZT4hJ49cO3TDHBdnPq4gPy3qq4zyA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It was our first time at this restaurant.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The burger was ok, nothing extraordinary, but I felt that it lacked flavour. The capresse salad was NOT a capresse salad (see photo). We were served a salad that consisted of mixed greens, principally lettuce, with a lemon on top and a single slice of tomato and 2 mini mozzarella balls at the very bottom. I was so confused by this that I assumed there must've been a mistake and asked our server to double check with the kitchen, she responded that that was their capresse salad and left. It is criminal to call this a capresse salad, and if they don't know how to make one then don't put it on the menu because it will lead to disappointed customers.\nMaybe we'll give their pizzas another chance in the future, but let's just say that the first experience in this place wasn't a great one."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP_gzWLwz0vCYM_15hbkQgsr02T5OplSW3-d1Nm\u0026fid=0x0:0xc0f5845d941c9b55""],""When"":""2023-9-14""},{""Name"":""Raeburn MacDougall"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVIoXHoCNiCsL0dOjQhl4dr7HXmy8LsAXROqZKdAcT-ThcE0fCn=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I was walking by and saw their happy hour sign...good price for an app and a beer instead of fast food joint...I ordered poutine and breaded shrimp...it was awesome and just enough...service was great.

There were a lot more things i did not like compared to the things i kind of liked.  I can’t recommend the dinner buffet at their full price of $30 per person. The food quality is not good enough to warrant such a price. Out of all the food I tried, the only thing i really liked the cheesecake at the dessert bar. The buffet is a decent choice for dinner if you happen to get your hands on a coupon like the $10 discount or the buy one get one free deal they give out from time to time.\n\nAs for the soups, the coconut curry soup was too watery and didn’t taste like anything. I couldn't finish it.\n\nAs for the salads, I took some coleslaw. It tasted alright. I only took it so my meal would be more balanced with veggies.\n\nAs for desserts, the cheesecake was very good. It wasn’t overly sweet which is good.  I noticed it was taken very quickly from other customers at the buffet but it was replenished quick by staff.\nThe chocolate cake bar slices were too sweet. It was sickly sweet. It had caramel drizzle on top of double chocolate breading and icing. Didn’t like it.\nI was disappointed that some dessert menu items were not at the buffet table. Under feature desserts, on the menu displayed at the front of the register, it says jello was included but there were none. There were no cookies either. I’m not sure why was it listed when it wasn’t included.\n\nAs for the mains, the pot roast with gravy didn’t have enough gravy. It was too dry for my liking. I couldn’t eat a lot of it because there was too much fat. The meat portions that I tasted was just OK.\nthe cheese mashed potatoes were very plain. they were bits of melted cheddar cheese with bits of potato skin inside. Worst part was that there was no gravy included. Who eats mashed potatoes without gravy?\nI kinda liked the spring rolls. They were on the salty side but they still tasted alright.\nThe fish with garlic butter sauce was alright. The garlic butter sauce barely added any flavor though. It really needs to be seasoned for it taste very good.\nThe ravioli pasta was alright. It could use a little more sauce though. You really need to season it first for it to taste any good.\nThe rest of the food, such as the chicken wings and the veggie stir fry, didn’t interest me.\n\nDrink selections were plentiful. The soda machine was a coca cola freestyle with many types of pop to choose from. My root beer soda tasted great. They also have coffee, hot chocolate, and juice. The apple juice and hot chocolate drinks were good quality.\n\nThe staff were friendly and fast.

The classic was great in texture and a little plain in flavouring for me but maybe it should be that way since it’s their original. Pieces were of decent size - you can choose between two sizes and we opted for the smaller size which is about $15.

Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. When I walked in and went to the counter, the employee who worked the counter looked so unimpressed when she saw me. Like how dare I disrupt her conversation in the kitchen. Eventually she decided to take my order, however, she had the dirtiest look on her face while doing so and very rudely replied to my request and even gave me my change and drink cup with so little effort I had to catch them while she rudely almost dropped them. Apparently I need to reach my arm over so far towards her end of the counter. While she didn’t even look my way while doing so. My gut said to just leave at this point but I really wanted to try the burgers. I wish I could say it was delicious but it wasn’t at all. Very dry and salty, I was disappointed. I might try a different location though, just to give it another chance. Maybe the next restaurant will have a front of house employee who actually wants to represent the business with a positive attitude. Fingers crossed.\n\nI’ve got to add to this because about 45min to and hour after having a few bites of the burger I’ve been so sick. I’m so glad I didn’t eat very much however this is not ok at all. Was it expired, raw, contaminated, I don’t know. But I hope they do a thorough clean and get all new products. I hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else.

I am firmly of the opinion that for the great cost that it takes to travel out to venues for meals overall (time, travel, fuel, meal, taxes, etc.). So here’s my rating.\n\n* Cost and Value\nCost seems slightly higher than necessary. When I was young it was a quarter for a coffee and that wasn’t that long ago! $4.25 plus tax for a single, no-refill coffee is outrageous. French toast (on this visit) was a decent size and tasty. But still feels about $3 overpriced.\n\n* Customer Service\nThe service here knocks two stars off. Both of my visits the servers were snippy, abrupt and had so little patience that they wouldn’t stand for ten seconds to wait for change or an order to be made. Entirely uncooperative, very surface polite…but eye rolling etc = management needs to immediately give a customer service lesson to most of the staff. The server was totally unwilling to discuss dietary requirements, minor modifications or to check on food allergy concerns. If I was the manager of this place I would have fired the server on the spot. They were all old enough to know better and regardless of the difficulty of the customers they may deal with, in an almost empty place I expected MUCH better decorum.\n\n* Enjoyment and Presentation\nThe food was good, and presented decently. I would say there is a strong disconnect on what Canadian culture currently is, as vegetarian options were few and both the “veggie” soups when I went had meat bases! How disconnected from the food industry trends is the cook? Other than the rude server and a lack of options or cooperation, this rating is below average. Still passable if you need to have a filling meal while nearby."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNglz6VQRc8uX1Ev_WYLtrshL2SZ-GXuvnIuydR\u0026fid=0x0:0xbe1267c3150ee48b""],""When"":""2022-6-16""}]",

As a dog lover, the inclusive pet-friendly policy significantly enhanced our dining experience, contributing to the overall laid-back vibe of the place.\n\nThe outdoor seating area presented a slight hiccup, as only half the tables benefit from the shade, either natural or via umbrellas. However, after a short wait, we managed to nab a shaded spot for our meal.\n\nA point worth noting is the slightly elusive location of the restrooms, hidden within the upstairs hostel. This required a minor search, but the overall experience outweighed this minor inconvenience.\n\nThe charm of DICED lies within its simple but well done menu. The irresistible Cuddle burger has managed to capture the hearts of many, including mine. The unbeatable combination of delectable flavor and affordable pricing make it a standout choice!\n\nA crucial aspect not to be forgotten is the cafe's commendable work within the community. Functioning as a social enterprise, DICED invests in shaping the future of young adults in the culinary field.

Another example was a few weeks ago I ordered a sundae and it only had half the amount of ice cream and fudge as previous. Curbside orders take CRAZY long to be delivered.

Eventually after 20 minutes waiting, we made contact with the manager who apparently sent a confirmation text to a wrong number so we never received instructions on how to enter the property and get to our room. She was also very rude to my fiancé after she pronounced her name incorrectly. After waiting another 20 minutes for the code to get in the room we decided to go to another hotel that we could actually get access to. Would not recommend staying here if you have an event to go to seeing as this circus almost resulted in us being late to the wedding. There are much better hotels in Elk Grove for about the same price. Hopefully, the manager will do the right thing and refund us the money that we are owed for a room we did not use.\n\nFollow up with the manager, they will not be dropping the charge.

Dining on the boat however is a nice experience and would be terrific for a date night. We sat outside at the water and the view is so worth the trip. It’s a bit on the pricey side though so be prepared. We had a bottle of wine and some appetizers, just a nice evening sitting and talking. Service was great and very attentive. You walk through old town Sacramento to get to the boat and it’s nice because it’s situated right by the parking garage."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNL0QL8Na5YkID-1TUpWTBxzbCVFCW_qbZz-Vjf\u0026fid=0x0:0xc379835b2103c263""],""When"":""2024-12-10""},{""Name"":""Amanda Parks"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXrQtKULqWGuVmLPmiOzubyUi31xprUyro1Nuz7JgbtSLQ2skod=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We went for the murder mystery dinner and had a great time.

dinner at Taverna Gorgona in Ladner with my wife and son, and it was a truly memorable experience.

The decor, with its Mediterranean charm, created an atmosphere that felt authentic and cozy.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Our server was attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable about the menu, and eager to ensure our dining experience was perfect. We appreciated their recommendations, which proved to be spot-on.\n\nThe food was the star of the evening. We started with the calamari, which was perfectly crispy and paired with a delightful tzatziki sauce. For mains, my wife had the lamb souvlaki, my son opted for the chicken souvlaki, and I went for the seafood platter. Each dish was cooked to perfection, bursting with fresh flavors and generous portions. The accompanying Greek salad and rice pilaf were delicious and well-balanced.\n\nWe couldn’t resist finishing the meal with baklava, and it was easily one of the best we’ve ever had—crispy, sweet, and not overly heavy.\n\nWhat stood out most was the genuine hospitality and the restaurant’s ability to make you feel at home while enjoying a fine dining experience.

The restaurant was not busy, so I didn't understand the long wait periods.\n\nIt was a Friday during Lent, so I ordered the grilled salmon with the sweet chili sauce on the side, along with the clam chowder.  As an appetizer, we ordered the grilled artichoke to start. The artichoke was a good size and prepared well.  It was tender and you could taste the smokiness of the grill. Absolutley delicious!  The clam chowder was like wallpaper paste. It was thick and gloppy; not very good. The salmon was nothing spectacular. It was a tail portion, grilled all the way through (I prefer mine just slightly underdone), served over a bed of rice pilaf with broccolini.  Overall, the meal was good, but a bit overpriced for what we got.

What a great start!\n\nWhile standing in line waiting for our order to be taken, we were looking at menu along with the bountiful amount of teas and drinks! I was overwhelmed with giddiness. I ordered the veggie scramble with a side of turkey bacon, the peach smoothie, and the lavender lemonade! As we walked through the interior dining room, the outside tables were calling us! There were plenty of available tables with some in the shade and sun. However, it quickly filled up just after we ordered. The space has a very casual, laid-back atmosphere, where you get your own water and utensils before finding your table, and you feel like you're eating in someone's backyard.

I want to be clear, the food was very good, hot and fresh, so none of the rest of this review concerns the food quality.\nAs stated I have been a guest at Niagara a number of times over the past 20 years, tonight myself and my friend were treat as an after thought.  It started upon our arrival, we had made a reservation only to be made to feel like we were imposing.  The table we were taken to had been set for 4 but \""the people had not arrived so we could have the table.\""  We knew what we were having and ordered immediately (we were sharing a medium pizza and a baked lasagna). Neither of us want anything other than water, I guess that was our first mistake not ordering alcohol. Our pizza arrived in the appropriate amount of time but no lasagna, we ended up having to ask and then we had to wait for the garlic bread.  At no time did someone come by to ask how our meals were, but we noted that the large parties were being fawned over by 3 or 4 service staff, not professional at all.\nI was not happy.  We were not offered desert or coffee, instead we were brought take away containers and 2 candies were DROPPED on the table and were asked \""one cheque or 2?\"". As the fellow walked away my friend commented that a cup of coffee would be nice.  When the fellow came back with the cheques my friend asked politely for a cup of coffee, he never apologized that we had not been asked.....just walked away.  And to note all our dirty dishes were still on the table!  He came back with coffee and the cheques.  After 10 minutes another fellow walked by and said \"" oh you want to pay?\"" Another 10 minutes and we had to request to pay, at that time I commented that I was having the worst experience and was not happy.  The waitress, nor anyone else asked why.....finally we paid.  My tip reflected my disappointment.\n\nIn this day and age when restaurants have an expectation of a minimum of 18% Gratuities the management  better be ensuring that the 18% is deserved.  I refuse to pay for poor guest services. I work and have worked in customer facing businesses for years, sometimes for minimum wage and I do not receive tips other than how to do my job better.

They opened up 3 bedrooms for us to explore. They were very nice! Food was good. A bit pricey, but I think it's worth it to go to a mansion to eat brunch.

The experience is enhanced if you go with friends and dress up really nice.\n\nMy cousin was pounding down the mimosas. I love pasta, and this pasta was one of the best I ever had. The pear salad dressing was very good! I didn't care for the dessert though, and I wish they could do better.

The hospitality and service provided by the GIM staff far surpassed our expectations. Every staff member we encountered was kind and helpful. Our day of coordinator was Tara, and she was amazing. She kept things running smoothly and was so supportive throughout the entire day. We also booked overnight rooms and had such a fun time at our after party. It was truly my dream wedding come true, and I wish I could go back and do it one more time! I loved everything about GIM. Thank you to all of GIM staff!

And I've seen this place grow. There are a few bad reviews here but that's hard to believe considering the fact that the workers, food, and atmosphere were way above the minimum. I love this place personally. The Patty melt and French toast are to die for. and the French fries beat the average fast food place. Don't miss it. The only thing to complain about is the closing time. But that only makes for a healthier working environment that the majority of the middle aged average workers like to bash on. Bob's is one of my favorite places to eat. Don't miss out for breakfast and Lunch. It's also very dog friendly and has boat access. Its often brimming with a whole bunch of people, animals included. Birds, dogs, sometimes even the stray cat will survey the area. And an earlier complaint about \""spiderwebs\"" comes normal when you're sitting outside. so if you hate bugs, you always have the inside option. I highly recommend Bob's, and if you give it a try; I'm sure you will too."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

I am also grateful for the non-metal chairs!\nIt was 27°. We've just been cooling in the forests of the beautiful UBC Botanical Garden and not quite ready to drive back to the city. Westward Ho at the UBC Golf Course came up on my Google search for brunch. Their patio picture was the deciding factor. Since it was nearly Happy Hour, the pub wasn't crowded and we were able to get a table in the impressively big patio. Not sure if it would be equally impressive had it been a really sunny day. We'd have to check that out another time. On this cloud day, the patio was very bright – almost to the point where I have to put on my sun glasses.\nAs for the food, we had a hard time choosing: fresh fish and chips, fish sandwich, Beyond Beef burger, all day breakfast, etc. I ordered a Club House with multigrain yam fries, my companion ordered fresh Cod and Chips. The bread in my Club House was dried out, the sandwich did not look as scrumptious as the one with sour dough presented to the table next to us. My sandwich was too 'orderly', the chicken did not spill out of the sandwich like the one I saw earlier. I enjoyed the cod fish though – very fresh and not over battered. So, I guess I ordered the wrong thing! I liked the choice of using vinegar on coleslaw instead of mayo. A decent size coleslaw for a more balanced meal. MSG? For a few hours afterwards, I was very thirsty, but did not get the usual sickly feeling from eating MSG. So, not sure what was in the food that caused my tongue to feel so dry."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNjr8zNCvHQWWPDvIvCsF-m8vfK6OTg8xyORYzH\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2021-8-2""},{""Name"":""Azi Jahan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVoCqSGFWxXVxJxNnyUrYmJjWJKEtREeG-G0RXpmBRv8kbELxEL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""For gulf lovers for sure, it's a well-known place.\n\nBeautiful location and view🤌🏻\nDelicious brunch\nSo kind and supportive staff\n\nIt's a peaceful weekend brunch location if you are looking for a calm weekend's brunch🤩"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP4NKPC_4N4_VYCzznfOGLy34Q4VWIecJtPF0BY\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2022-7-29""},{""Name"":""Paul Rogers"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI-2DEuMMhV7vJRExrjz5OPFG99Ya8EpWqhlLnkXnZqRJpDqw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""My family went here with a few other people for dinner.

Unfortunately, the policies have changed and a beverage and gratuity is added, very fair, since I was told that some didn't tip, so the policy changed from this week. From this visit, the sauce amount has decreased, and the pasta has gone from al dente to harder, basically raw pasta.\n\nThe first plate of pasta was almost perfectly al dente but still slightly under what I preferred, and was still a treat to enjoy.  After the first plate, I had asked if the pasta could be made softer for the next.  They said that it would not be possible since the pasta is par-cooked.  However, for the next 2 plates, the pasta got harder and harder until I tasted flour and I decided to cut into one.  Well, it was raw inside (photo included).  At this point after 2.5 plates of hard pasta, I didn't feel like asking for it to be remade since they told me before that it wasn't possible.\n\nOverall, the food experience was marginally unacceptable after the first plate. The service was good and the sports bar atmosphere was excellent.   I recommend the rigatoni alla vodka sauce for the all access pasta since it tastes the best, pesto the second.\n\nAfter the complaint, I was told there had been a miscommunication that the pasta couldn't be cooked longer, and the drink cost was taken off as a result."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMb5h3FMgcqIKIxfIJ4PYZyyEEGjALlZXy1MfK1\u0026fid=0x0:0xfbcd82c95f6df084""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""Simon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWq3mMD7x0QRiQPROCB5BEqtJbykKAfvm5IFcPhyVt8QiitDIxq=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I got introduced to this place by a foodie influencer  (Howie) and got to enjoy a lot of their food.

The taste from the AAA medium-rare flat iron Steak with the  goat cheese and bbq sauce had such a really nice, umami flavour and mouth feel. It was just so delicious!\n\nI also ordered a Nashville Chicken Sando. No pictures taken as the first bite literally made me devour it on the spot!

Unbelievable these days, parking is free, but the number of spaces  is limited and tend to fill up early in the day.\nSecond, the bad news: A number of typical fast foods are available, but I made the bad decision to try the fish and chips. While the serving was large, the fish tasted like old, burnt, cooking oil. While some like crispy batter, this one was well beyond crispy. You had to battle through it with firm stabs of the provided wooden fork. If the word ‘fish’ had not been on the menu I would not have known what that white stuff inside the batter was. Zero taste. A bland, underwhelming taste of nothing. The fries were just passable, by which I mean only arguably edible.

I wouldn't go here as a night out, but at the right times, it's a chill hang. The atmosphere varies wildly depending on the day. On some nights it's louder and is in line with what you'd expect a university bar to be like, and sometimes it's very relaxed, and you can even find some people using it as a study spot (not something I would consider or really recommend, but you do you as long as it's not busy and no one needs the table). Sometimes it's somewhere in between or a weird mix of both. It's not always predictable, but I've found that to hit the quieter days that I prefer, early evening during exam season at school is best, and summer in general are chiller than the main academic year.\nThe food is good, often surprisingly good. The menu items are well thought-out and tasty, and nicely presented. It's not a veg-centric establishment but there's lots of choice for vegans! Off the current menu, I've had the Power Punch Salad, the Vegan Pulled Jackfruit, the Vegan Burger, Vegan Chick'n Caesar Wrap, and the Tempeh Teriyaki. I wasn't particularly impressed by the Caesar wrap - it wasn't awful, I just didn't feel like it was worth $19.5, but everything else was a delight. I'm glad their vegan burger is a (seemingly) housemade, minimally processed black bean patty instead of beyond meat or similar! I usually won't order a salad as my meal, but the Power Punch is substantial! The side salad that comes with the sandwich orders is actually pretty nice too.\nThey make good cocktails and have a long list of local draft beers on tap which I haven't really had a chance to dip into, but I got the \""Green Bird\"" for fun on St. Patrick's Day, which is just a version of their house \""T-Bird\"" lager that's been coloured green (maybe naturally, judging by the grassy notes I got from it, but I don't know for sure). It was actually a good lager though!\nSometimes the staff is nice enough, sometimes I get the vibe that they're too cool to be serving me or something, but because the only interactions you have with them are when you order and pay at the bar and when they bring your food out, an unenthusiastic bartender doesn't ruin the whole experience. Because of this service style, you can expect to be in and out of here faster than you would at a full table service restaurant, but it's not fast food, so dishes still take as much time to prep as they would at a \""regular\"" sit-down place. It's also pricier than typical counter service food, but very reasonably priced compared to off-campus restaurants that serve food of this quality, and there's no obligation to tip 20%. To me, the service model, fair prices, and high quality are a combination of the best elements of counter service and full service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQwEdJ88aXsSlarpRs-9jcRwBTBo0B-hIa3KfE\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b84d3debc8f1cec""],""When"":""2021-4-19""},{""Name"":""Steve Morgan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmgrmzSyB3CC_qWamR3pXmaZna6-RxfqDluiFzTGNrypDReGc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very large service area.

The other reasons include that there just isn't that much choice on campus and the food is basic but decent here. The view is nice if you're out on the patio. And there's a lot of space. It's very sad that the sit-down nice restaurant didn't make it because that's exactly what the area needs. They just didn't promote it and since this is the top floor, no one discovers this space by walking by. The service at the Gallery when it was in the old sub was never this sad.

Last time (August) I ordered the Pork (pictured), this time the Farm (October) and both came with meat and rice, and a tiny bit of slaw. No salad. I didn't realize how much the lettuce and tomato balanced the meat and rice combo. Now it is too dry yet also sort of greasy (not sauce) to eat. No freshness. Not for me anymore. I always get take out, as inside feels grubby, the floor is sticky when you walk. That kind of things always makes me wonder what the cleanliness behind the scenes where your food is made is like... Without the salad it is a spoon of meat and two spoons of rice with a sprinkle of slaw so very overpriced at $13. It is the size of the palm of your hand for reference. I also eat with my eyes and was disappointed with how the burger looked, and sadly tasted. I used to crave this place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMYJ5S0DbHsJ0w9h1XuMRlCQCM8C4m_WwGggX4b\u0026fid=0x0:0x25762a4aae318566""],""When"":""2024-10-10""},{""Name"":""Dennis Li"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXJgBHuKaxB6_AGRs3DyAn5DYWAJVYL8OdZQBLbOlZjEJJMR8F5KA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""This restaurant is participating in TooGoodToGo app, this photo shows the surprise bag order, half the price of mini beef bowl, not bad but a little small"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM0PIYdSvzNdUvylTulTbOJ5JGQdxLKWUlz6DNc\u0026fid=0x0:0x25762a4aae318566""],""When"":""2024-11-10""},{""Name"":""leesa tran"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUWsWaHyhzcw7kKPh9V3HkvTK5TTa81TdmCDp9IylYllx4puXIy=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Ordered the beef burger combo and it was really good.

Sitting varies from cafe tables, to Howarts style long tables or high-chair tables found in coffee shops. The food-serving area of the dinning hall is immediately at the place where you pay so you can line up to get your food. To avoid the line at the main entrance of the dinning hall, you can go to the back to pay as well.\n\nThe food here is okay. This is not a high-end restaurant. The food may not be for everyone. Also, there's a self serve ice cream machine, yogurt and salad bar. There are coffee machines and juice dispensers. There are plently of fruits, snacks and bread. At night, the pizza kitchen opens. Food is served in small to medium portion which is perfect for those who do not eat as much or want to try multple things. Chefs are polite and kind and will be willing to give you a bit of extra food if you ask.\n\nThere is no washroom in the dinning hall. You will have to leave the dinning hall and lose your ability to come back to use the washroom.\n\nIf you come here during regular meal times, expect there to be lots of students. If you come during 8:30am, 9:30 am or any time when class is in session, there are not as many people. Menu of the dinning hall can be found at both front and rear entrance.

Very warm atmosphere, from the design of the inside to the friendly service. Because the place is relatively small, it’s probably not a good idea to bring a large group, but it’s a nice place for a smaller hang or even to chill by yourself. I have been curious for a while and just tried it with some friends. I probably will be back.\nThey have a great drink menu with lots of specialty cocktails and nonalcoholic drinks. I got a nonalcoholic pineapple guava soda. I don’t like drinks that are too sweet and this was good for me, but some people might find it weak compared to commercial fruit sodas.\nI got a soup and sandwich combo as my entree with the Eggplant Caprese sandwich and the Crab Bisque. I really liked this take on a caprese sandwich, and the baguette was very fresh and soft. The bisque was very good too. Rather than being a super creamy bisque, this was more tomato-based and a little tangy. Good flavour with a fair amount of crab meat. I also liked the little side of coleslaw that was included in the combo.\nWasn’t really planning on getting dessert but then I saw they had a Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding, and I will rarely pass up on bread pudding. It was delicious but, as you might expect from bread pudding made of banana bread, with ice cream, with caramel sauce, VERY rich and heavy, and I had to get some help to finish it. I think this would be ideal for splitting between two people.\nFor this meal, with tip, I paid $48, which surprised me. I thought it was a good meal, but not $50 good - I’d associate that kind of price with a more upscale experience than this. I can understand the soup and sandwich pricing, the dessert was a little expensive, but what really strikes me as obviously overpriced would be the $8 soda. I understand it’s made in house, but it was just a fruity soda - no fruit bits or anything fancy, and no alcohol. It was a nice refreshing drink, but for $8 I wouldn’t say it was worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMA-33yhxlhuJWzrEmE3NBivENZ-qwhvFcoFjxN\u0026fid=0x0:0x57c0ba4874667b57""],""When"":""2023-5-20""},{""Name"":""Keith Ver"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXVdqxLCf1LEt0AU82myo-eUqDcb2LcbdnfhupJTEW0sPAQ-qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Good food and good service!

The ordering counter is downstairs with a seating area upstairs. It wasn't particularly clean: some tables had crumbs and there was trash on the floor under some tables, which weirdly is carpeted. The furniture, however, is in good condition and comfortable.\nFIRST VISIT: I had a felafel plate and a rice pudding. The food was average quality. The sauces they use are a little different than the typical sauces: the white sauce was thicker and tangier and the red sauce had a hint of heat but mostly tasted like a zestier and thinner version of ketchup (this is maybe not the most appealing way of describing it - it was good, like a cross between hot sauce and ketchup). I liked the different flavours and the rice was actually pretty good, but I was indifferent about the felafel and hummus. The felafels were like the puck-shaped ones you can buy at the grocery store. The rice pudding had a nice flavour but was almost gelatinous in consistency, which I can't decide how I feel about.\nSecond visit: I wanted to see if the more distinctly Persian dishes would be better, so I tried the eggplant stew, the one veg stew on the menu. The “broth” that the eggplant and tomato were stewed in was straight oil, which I did not like. Again the rice was great, but they give so much with the stew that I didn’t know what to do with it all.\nThe prices ($17 for the plate and stew w/ rice, $5 for the rice pudding) are fair for the amount of food you get, which is pretty generous. I finished the whole felafel plate but was very hungry, so if you have a smaller appetite you will have leftovers. Two people could easily split a rice pudding.\nThe staff seems very nice, but I just can’t see myself coming back for the food. I’d get the felafel again if it was the ONLY place to get felafel in town, but it is very much not."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNY72ngJ2ZaAwXFb3jb_xOhzFGMNLItp0KiPLjO\u0026fid=0x0:0x615e3b717137617d""],""When"":""2024-1-12""},{""Name"":""Abdullah K"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVaOLs3U1NGAh-EH96OS0WG3dhkXXnjYtovUMs7UYINOdg16mA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is my go-to place to eat on and around campus!

The golf simulation is good though and they have league play. There’s also a scramble every Tuesday morning with a friendly bunch and prizes."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Both were not too spicy for me, super tasty and generous portions.  I also had a breakfast crepe for the first time (ever. I’m just more familiar with Cantonese food) and it was so good and very large and filling.  I like their noodles which have a bit of a chew (look hand pulled rather than the skinny noodles you might expect normally in Dan Dan).  They were the same type of noodles in the meat sauce noodle dish (no soup).  The fried chicken is super crunchy so worth a try if you like fried chicken but I’m not looking for such an oily lunch/dinner.  Everything is fresh because it’s made to order.  They are open at night too. Looks like several of the other food court stalls did not open much.  Best thing to eat on the whole campus in my opinion.

It is the farthest dining hall compared to the other two.\n\nAfter entering the building, you will have to take a flight of stairs to get to the dining hall. The food available at Place Vanier comes from a variety of different cultures. Everyone will find something good to eat the dining hall. The dining hall can sit 200-300 people. It is a buffet style dining hall and you can get as much food you can eat.\n\nThere is a salad bar and custom sandwich making station. There is a  burgers, tacos, pork bun and pork belly ramen station. Food changes from time to time. It is best to check Nutrislice, the online menu app, to see what food the dining hall is serving before paying. The dining hall building has big windows overlooking the court yard of Place Vanier. You also have different kinds of seats like the Café style seats and also the long dining hall tables.\n\nDuring regular hours like mornings from 8-9am, lunch from 12-1pm, and dinner from 7-9pm, you will find lots of people there. You can avoid the traffic by avoiding these common times or arriving earlier to skip the potential line-up for food.\n\nThe presentation of the dish is average. The portions are small. Food is placed on the counter which may get cold and unclean. Food quality tastes ok, but the servers are more concerned about getting as much food out to as many students and people as possible. During peak hours, the place becomes hectic.  Food also is warm, not hot after peak times. Staff there are friendly and kind.\n\nWashrooms are downstairs, separate from the dining hall.\n\nParking is very close to the dining hall about a 5 minute walk. Near this dining hall, there are lots of nice trees to look at."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNkJTXAZhQtPzHpRvjlF4cdHyFgKSktppk9ET2t\u0026fid=0x0:0xe5bca09347600efd""],""When"":""2024-2-23""},{""Name"":""Raúl de León"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR1w_Ji0Yz-Xp82r5o46luBx2_3UdjKeiMHOkVr4mcBNjLxloC=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I don't know why people give bad reviews, this place is amazing.

They rotate all the time but I like their chicken soup, vegetables and legume curry, whatever bean soup, etc.\n\nGather has too much hate haha. It’s actually one of the healthiest and cheapest residence food among all the three.\n\nI wish they have more cooked green vegetables. They always have potatoes and squash but they don’t have enough broccoli, spinach, green beans, etc.\n\nGrill station is pretty good and they change menu around 2-4 weeks. Salmon burger is decent. I wish their chicken burger is cheaper.\n\nLatino is also my favourite. The Havana bowl is pretty good but sometimes they don’t season the chicken or tofu enough.\n\nHome cooking is also one of my favourite because they rotate the food daily. They have similar food every week. The vegetable lasagna with garlic bread is so good! Not a lot of cheese and love the sauce. Butter chicken is not really good imo.\n\nSandwich station is alright except they don’t have the press!!! Please we def need the press for sandwich especially for those who order with cheese.\n\nSimply local is a lot of people’s favourite. Not too expensive unless you get a main with two sides (around 12-14?).

The outcome was nothing short of spectacular. From the outset, the management and staff demonstrated remarkable dedication and professionalism.\n\nThe team at Gracie's Next Door delivered excellent service throughout our event. They were attentive, ensuring that tabs were accurately started for the correct guests and taking the time to remember each guest's name and preferences. The food was absolutely outstanding, with our guests continually commenting on how delicious and plentiful everything was. The impressive spread truly elevated the experience and left everyone delighted.\n\nWe were truly amazed by the turnout and the seamless execution of our reception. The hard work and commitment of the staff ensured that our day was flawless and unforgettable. A special thank you to Darren and the entire team at Mario's Kitchen and Gracie's Next Door for their exceptional service and support.\n\nWe wholeheartedly recommend Mario's Kitchen and Gracie's Next Door to both locals and visitors in South Delta.

Well, I was in holiday mood!!!\n- lovely young servers, very friendly and polite, taking our orders straight away\n- very clean toilets and clean cut place altogether\n- excellent food  with the chef paying attention to my requests\n- not far from the ferry terminal (maybe 20min by car), if you prefer to eat in a proper restaurant, rather than in the small and many cheap cafes at the terminal"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOeOjnAIdoEVVCVYoXXUT6GPWpzYx-uVrvgq3EN\u0026fid=0x0:0x7036a98cb704d7b9""],""When"":""2024-7-8""},{""Name"":""Wayne Lav"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUk880jfctdjiDn4tRAvocN5rCVUdtgArCHWFDiv2yxg-QvIz4L=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This restaurant, located just outside the mall, offers both indoor and outdoor seating with a pleasant ambiance.

We ended up with the Wagyu Smash Blue Burger with garlic parmesan fries, the Caprese Chicken Sandwich, and a standard veggie burger. California Spring Salad on the side was a fantastic addition as well. Quality was really impressive on the Wagyu burger, chicken sandwich was a little bland, and the veggie was above average.\n\nOur server was super friendly, made thoughtful suggestions on the menu, and was attentive.

Personally, I like the creative fusion dishes; just like in many restaurants in Japan. The service is consistently excellent, and I often notice the chefs behind the counter taking time to chat with the clients.

They have every flavor you want. My favorite is the dill pickle, but ask for more seasoning on the side if you want the saliva to flow. The classic Buffalo sauce is great too. And if you want sweetness, both the Fuji and Jakarta heat are delicious. After 3 years, I finally tried the Bobby Wing that practically burned a hole in my tongue. After getting over the heat, it was actually good. Complement it with calamari and have the dip nearby. You'll want to douse your tongue in the dip, and not the beer. By the way, the tacos are really good. Get a mixture of meat if you can.\n\nUpdate: Been there for lunch several times and noticed how quiet the place was. Unfortunately the place smelled more like a pub than a wings restaurant. I also think more emphasis can be done on trying to promote wing nights rather than trivia, hockey meals, etc. - all things that remind me of pubs than restaurants.

The lemon pepper wings turned out to be dry, and the taste of the honey garlic wings was unclear.\n\nAs for the soda, we ordered Coke and Sprite.

The wine was a delight because it is nothing you have ever tried! (I bet)\n\nPlace: Location is nice because it is on main street and parking is decent if you come when they open.

They didn't give me any drinks or cutlery or napkins.\nAnd when I called the guy had the nerve to ask me to drive there to pick up my drinks they forgot AND tried to blame the wait time on skip the dishes.\nWasn't until I told him I was going to leave a poor review that he offered to refund me for the 2 pops that I never even received........uhm yea I'm deffinately not paying for the items I never got buddy. Thanks alot. Meal should have been free.\n\nI also thought the meat portions were quite small.\n\n***I'm not sure how to respond to your response so I'm doing it here.\n\nAgain your trying to blame the skip driver.

a local business not only makes the most amazing food but also goes above and beyond in customer service, you know you’ve hit the jackpot!\nWe stopped at Roy’s on our way from Victoria to Vancouver after a long day of sightseeing. We reached 10 minutes before closing time, they had already closed the kitchen and were winding up for the day. When I told them I had specially come to sample their Bengali cuisine with my family, all the way from the east coast, they opened their kitchen and hearts for us.\nThe food was cooked to perfection. We celebrated my husband’s 50th with his favourite; kosha mangsho ( slow cooked goat curry) which reminded me of home. The flaky laccha parantha was perfect with it. 10/10\nWe had the prawn curry with lime leaves and it was spicy and so so delicious. We washed it down with gur-er rosogolla (cottage cheese balls soaked in a sweet jaggery syrup)and my only regret was that I didn’t pack more to takeaway.\nIt was an outstanding meal, cooked to perfection, authentic Bengali food in every sense. The staff was extremely helpful and made our dining experience at Roy’s one that was really special.\nThank you Roy’s for bringing the Indian hospitality and food to Canada. You made a lasting impression on us and we can’t wait to come back when we are back on the West Coast."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMun4f_A6fXdDsFxDQUlfcNaEYNAC9ls_SVueYC\u0026fid=0x0:0xb7f0a68c89ea8418""],""When"":""2024-8-7""},{""Name"":""Pooja Chaudhary"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVikZvhBSYSeJHyC2iVE3uoSeiUL7_8Q-E6SrAo6CM8YBBQWbE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""TLDR; average food, got food poisoning after.\n\nWe came in with high expectations because of the rating, but were quite disappointed with the food - flavors et al. Between the two of us we ordered the Manchurian cauliflower, the paneer peas and a naan. The Manchurian was ok. The paneer was entirely flavorless - the gravy tasted like dal, which was so weird.\n\nAfter all this, I chalked it up to just picking bad options on the menu. But 30 minutes after, I had an upset stomach and my partner had full blown food poisoning - that has definitely tipped my experience to a negative one.\n\nService is very nice though.

Located adjacent to the food court, this casual eatery presents a range of Japanese-inspired dishes with an emphasis on ramen.\n\nFood\n\nTakoyaki\nMenbow’s takoyaki is a commendable starter. Served warm, the exterior is delicately crispy, while the inside retains a creamy, well-balanced texture. The flavor is satisfying, though not particularly distinctive. A reliable choice for takoyaki enthusiasts.\nRating: 7/10\n\nShoyu Ramen\nThe shoyu ramen delivers a robust, savory broth complemented by tender chashu slices. The portion size is generous, making it a comforting option. While it satisfies on all fronts, it doesn’t venture into memorable territory.\nRating: 7/10\n\nTantan Ramen\nThis tantan ramen impresses with its creamy broth and nutty undertones. The flavors are rich and balanced, though an extra touch of spice could have elevated the dish. It remains a solid pick for those seeking a slight kick.\nRating: 7/10\n\nMini Pork Rice Bowl\nA standout on the menu, the mini pork rice bowl features succulent, well-seasoned pork paired with perfectly cooked rice. Its balance of textures and flavors makes it one of the more satisfying options.\nRating: 8/10\n\nDeep-Fried Gyoza\nCrisp and golden, the deep-fried gyoza is a dependable side dish. The filling is flavorful, though it doesn’t necessarily set itself apart from similar offerings elsewhere.\nRating: 7/10\n\nChicken Karaage\nThe chicken karaage, while adequately crispy, falls short of expectations. The seasoning lacks depth, leaving the dish somewhat underwhelming compared to other options on the menu.\nRating: 6/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nMenbow Ramen boasts a clean and modern interior that feels fresh and inviting. Despite being located in a busy mall, the restaurant offers a pleasant escape with its well-maintained space. The self-service kiosk system is intuitive and efficient, streamlining the ordering process.\nRating: 8/10\n\nService\n\nService is functional, with staff acknowledging customers without any particular warmth or attentiveness. While it meets basic expectations, the experience lacks the personalized touch that can elevate casual dining.\nRating: 7/10\n\nPrice\n\nThe pricing is fair and consistent with the portion sizes and quality of the food. Menbow Ramen offers good value for a quick and satisfying meal within a shopping mall setting.\n\nVerdict\n\nMenbow Ramen Tsawwassen offers a reliable dining experience for mall-goers seeking quality ramen and Japanese-inspired dishes. While it may not deliver standout culinary moments, it excels in convenience, cleanliness, and overall consistency. For shoppers in need of a quick, satisfying bite, Menbow Ramen is a commendable choice."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOdJppCTuFoOyKYEiGh_2mEUaLbU5wKqg1tPAIC\u0026fid=0x0:0x5bc528369b8869b6""],""When"":""2024-11-29""},{""Name"":""Tony Li"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXf8VP49ZjSvgG0JnhT1tc6Tv6OzLL9YEi_yNvwH1rW_K8-7VE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""After seeing a 2.8 rating, I wanted to go back to Menbow Ramen to see if it deserved that rating or not. If you've been to Japan, you would have experienced ordering your food from a kiosk before sitting down in the restaurant. Thumbs up on that, except when you select the daily special, don't assume I want to order a drink. It's almost as though it is included in the price but it is not. Just don't pick anything and add to cart. I selected take out so when the food came, it was nicely packaged in a covered bowl. Thumbs up on the package. No instructions but its easy to figure it out. Just in case youre not sure, ask before you leave the restaurant. Today it was an Asian guy who served me. He was polite. Other times I've come here, it's been a caucasian lady. She was also pleasant. On their soft opening, there were two chefs. Perhaps they were working out the kinks and they weren't the best public facing individuals minding the store. The broth is delicious. Unlike a lot of ramen joints in Tokyo, the broth is not oily. You can drink it without worrying about the fat. They deserve 4 stars for the ramen. Don't order the chicken karaage. I agree, the taste is off. Squeeze some lemon on it or skip it altogether. And come on Tuesdays when extra noodles are free. If you want chicken, order the Tuesday $3.99 box at KFC. Now that's a finger lickin' deal."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNQvTTC8SI-gJTFkY2PqkcxYweO0hmwn1D--qFS\u0026fid=0x0:0x5bc528369b8869b6""],""When"":""2024-12-11""},{""Name"":""James Gonzales"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0unpnU-8mggud0YcgWewTeEH_sT0-3Uzrhx_zm_qDfPS-Nug=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""No more need to go to Vancouver for good ramen places as this has great tasting ramen!

Kiosk staff is friendly, the blackshirt(manager?) not so much. The “daily special ramen” which I assumed was some sort of generic sauce to water mix, was extremely salty. Me and my friend both took two bites and agreed it wasn’t paranoia. When we placed the unfinished bowl to the return shelf the kiosk staff asked how was it, I replied a tad salty, very salty. Then the manager overheard that and told me it was impossible because they didnt add soy sauce, and asked whether WE were the ones that added it ourselves. I said no, we never add sauce prior to tasting it as is, and I never claimed they added specifically soy sauce. Whatever they had in the broth was extremely salty. Manager doesn’t even apologize, I shook my head and said it’s alright, never mind and left.\n\nSo Mr black shirt whoever you are, you’re giving the staff a bad reputation, because frankly the other staffs are sympathetic and nice."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP6M8dtndA01kooQurJPGx81psflGD5t_8lxU-C\u0026fid=0x0:0x5bc528369b8869b6""],""When"":""2024-8-11""},{""Name"":""Dave"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI_LjB1fIYfyDUjgL_-07doYO2DdqKnjIx6lTxP0wGruUckNw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""I just visited this place today Dec 22th which is full of Christmas shopper.

Mission accomplished.\n\nI live in Seattle, so I'm a couple of hours away. But if I could, I would return week after week, and perhaps even day after day. Because coming to Connaught Place is like coming home, even if I'm not Indian.\n\nAfter a long day of traveling from Salt Spring Island, we needed a quiet dinner to restore ourselves. I chose Connaught Place from the many positive reviews. We found the unassuming eatery tucked behind an office building and peered in the windows to see it empty. With trepidation, we approached the door just as a young woman was pulling up to pick up take out. I asked her how the food was and without hesitating, her face lit up and she said, \""Oh my god, it's delicious! Plus, it's family owned and I love to support small business.\""\n\nEnough said. We slid into a booth and was greeted by the lovely Satbir. She helped us (Indian-food novices), decide what to order based on our input: samosas, naan and lamb korma. She could tell we needed a little pick-me-up and kindly brought us papadum (a crispy wafer-like bread) with mango chutney.\n\nThe samosas were hot and tasty, however, the star of the table was the lamb korma. With generous chunks of tender lamb in a rich and creamy sauce, it was the stuff my dreams are made of. Accompanied by a hearty serving of rice, it was plenty for my husband and me. Even after we were satisfied, we kept on heaping food on our plate because we didn't want to miss out on one more bite.\n\nWhile chatting with Satbir, we mentioned that it was our anniversary and she surprised us with scoops of mango ice cream! Just the thing to top off a memorable meal. We were definitely happy diners.\n\nThroughout the evening, many people came and went from Connaught Place to pick up their to-go orders. But I suggest dining in the relaxing space because not only is the food superb, but Satbir is a delight, and an integral part of a wonderful experience. Oh, and you might want to order more than one main dish because you'll definitely want leftovers."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNwDP86BmOkutA77Dz0l0WGT6IKziVi7Vh0UKnH\u0026fid=0x0:0x68c8a7d638fd7531""],""When"":""2023-8-2""},{""Name"":""Celestial Producer"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLcwqfWl1gr39vLtzTdQX1KjMjQn0etzAzDHo-cF4Ad1jRuxQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best Fish Pakora ever and butter chicken ever...real spices...been coming here since they opened ...you can taste the love in their food...amazing family....who ever complains has no idea about food with amazing flavor or they get paid by the competition shame on you🤔 😋\nLove you Connaught family xoxo 😘"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Abhinav Jindal"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJM4oZCfhRvIsNadmGhYgIAN02ymUQqZkd-HEyw_g2b22BpSw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We ordered Dal Maharani (Spice level hot) with Naans and Rotis, and it was really amazing.

Honestly, I think the vast majority of fish and chips are bland and rather sad. However, anything made well can overturn that sweeping generalization. And I am proud to say that of all the fish and chips I've had that Harry's  is worth it. The fish is perfect. I highly recommend the haddock. The batter is thin, crispy, well seasoned. Not too oily. The chips are great. The tartar sauce is excellent.\n\nThe curry sauce was very disappointing. It tastes like some cheap powdered Curry sauce and I feel if they put the same love into it as the rest of the stuff, it would be a knock out. But most importantly, Harry's does what a fish and chips place should do well.... The fish and the chips.  Having eaten fish and chips on white rock, steveston, Granville Island, Melbourne and across numerous other places, the batter is always too thick so it gets soggy quick or overpowers the fish or is thick and soaked with oil and grease or it is just plain underseaoned which often seems to be the case in The Vancouver area. An aversion to seasoning. Harry's gets it right.\n\nIt took almost 40 mins to get food while there were only 4 other tables there so that is a negative and they never checked on us to say that the food was going to take a while. So the girl working the front should have been a little more proactive. We happened to be in a particularly patient mood that day so we waited without saying anything."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""G.

There are also no locations near where we live, since we were shopping here, we decided to try it out. Overall very happy with the food, service and ambience, 100% recommend you visit this location if you are anywhere near the area.\n\nThe interior decor is really nice and welcoming, restaurant seats 30-40 people, lots of seating options from regular tables to couches, booths and one high table. We were greeted by the employee behind the counter. We used the app to place our order and it was a very smooth experience but also could have ordered in-store.\n\nThe burrito was 10/10. The portion was generous, the food was very flavourful and the ingredients looked so fresh. In fact the staff was preparing some meat and vegetables on the grill behind the counter when we came in.\n\nThe bathrooms were clean too and the service from Twinkle was fantastic.\n\nOverall, this location of Mucho Burrito blew our expectations and left us with a very good taste. I hope this location gets a lot more business when customers see the incredible value they offer.\n\nI consider myself a fairly tough critic but the entire experience at Mucho Burrito was a 10/10."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOkNzurAX4BewBCOI3MbxFxEJwZDGRJI3MPXXay\u0026fid=0x0:0x348601124d1e0e1f""],""When"":""2024-6-10""},{""Name"":""Wild Wanderlust Photography"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXYPQeHy2fRvptt6V1NtTq0t9CdOFiP_rQd_Emm8iYNczU9hCDSwA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I just love their monster burritos!

After about a minute, I had lost patience and was just about to leave, and she came over to the ordering side and just stood there. Still no acknowledgment.

This time it was served by the tall guy who I've seen there since day 1. He was nice enough but the food was really bad. The noodles were overcooked and soggy.

But if we wanted to eat a balanced meal with a decent amount of cooked vegetables, that's what's available. We stopped by the mill before heading out to the ferry to grab a bite to eat. I was going to have a simple Chachi's sandwich but would prefer more vegetables, and Bourbon Street Grill is the next stall. But the food was almost not edible because of the amount of salt in the food. I ate less than half and left the rest. We've since gone back again in case there was a different cook.

and tired after shopping in the mall, AVOID AVOID AVOID this store. Don't throw your hard-earned money into the lake.\n\nIn the 5 or 6 years I've been going to MaryBrowns, this was the most disappointing experience. To be honest, I've always liked the juiciness of the chicken and the professionalism of the service, but this store pleasantly surprised me.\n\n1, When placing the order, the front desk staff press the big mary as the original price without hesitation. He didn't look like a new employee who got the job that day. After I mentioned that today was Monday and the sandwich should be half price, he continued to mumble a reason instead of a simple \""sorry\"" and changed it back to half price. This is the first time in many years that I need to remind the staff what day of the week it is.\n2, I ordered another box of \""made for 2\"". It has always been served in one box before, but today it was packed in several paper trays. Maybe it's not a big deal, but I still need to confirm with the staff \""Is this what I ordered?\"", and the gravy bowl is also covered with gravy. Maybe it's not a big deal, but this is the first time.\n3, Finally, I came to my favorite part of the chicken. The five pieces of chicken were obviously mixed. Two of them were newly made, and the rest were unknown. How should I understand this? Is it leftover from the previous customer? Or is it the same order with different cooking skill? The first time in many years.\n\nSo, long story short, This will be my last time here, maybe some people will confuse\""just because of a mistake?\"", okay, let me tell you, in the past few years, I have enjoyed countless excellent services and delicious chicken in many MB stores in BC, they are still there, why should I come back here again? Now the big economic environment is not good, it's not easy for everyone, but don't treat customers as idiots, right🤝"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNMlWjuIZ9y8a1w3wTnRvKkBeMzjVdLdTHu64FF\u0026fid=0x0:0x30da3eb802012ba8""],""When"":""2024-12-17""},{""Name"":""Peter Estrada"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVw52Fx60bw34dCukF0QbSF82RCB7ujq7YTAahYaTLdvpQbj8VVtg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""First time here.

Firstly, when a client enters, the staff need to learn how to greet clients. It's awful seeing sad faces on the counter. Secondly, there has to be some flexibility to satisfy a customer. I requested a small fries instead of two biscuits, but no communication whatsoever, and request wasn't granted. FYI, Popeyes ALWAYS replaces our biscuits with a small side upon request. Thirdly, they charge an upcharge of $5 if you request either dark or white pieces of the chicken. I have yet to see a friend chicken place here do this, except them. Fourthly, FOUR of the twelve pieces in the order were wings.. again, unacceptable. If I wanted to order wings, I could have done it. I ordered chicken, and I expect chicken, not wings. Also, my 11 year old son went to the counter to ask for hot sauce. He came back seconds later with a sarcastic smile telling us \""they charge $0.99 for hot sauce, so embarrassing, no?\"" What is with all this greed honestly? Are we not already paying enough!? The management really needs to work on this. On the positive side, their chicken tastes good, the location is good, and the washroom is very clean. I remember when this place opened up, things were much better. However, because of these negative experiences, I wouldn't think of going back here. There is a reason my sons asked if there was a Popeyes nearby.. If I was the restaurant owner, I wouldn't have been happy to hear that from a young kid.

From the moment I walked in, it seemed like the staff were uninterested and inattentive. We waited almost 20 minutes to give our order. my experience with the cashiers left a lot to be desired. There was a old lady on there cash. It was clear that she struggled with basic tasks like reading the order correctly or understanding simple instructions. I had to repeat my order multiple times, and even then, it was still entered wrong.\nWhen I tried to explain the mistake, the cashier seemed confused and unable to fix it without calling over a manager, which slowed down the process even more. The lack of basic communication skills made what should have been a quick and easy transaction incredibly frustrating.she doesn't seems professional as at all.it was almost impossible to get cashier's attention for simple things like water refills she cannot even understand that basic thing.It's alarming that a restaurant would allow such poorly trained or ill-equipped staff to handle customer orders and payments.Customer service starts at the register, and if your cashiers can't handle even that, it really diminishes the overall dining experience. I hope they invest in better training or hiring staff who can provide a smoother and more professional experience.The overall attitude of the staff made the experience uncomfortable and unwelcoming.\nI had heard good things about the food here, but with such poor customer service, I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jada f"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXBMbFjOAN3hgEEo2BAevmyr4y71okWigCdxsj9jXJ-PgQrPXW95A=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""As a former Edo employee I'm pretty sure you are not allowed to deny service to someone claiming you have 0 sushi then proceed to sell the same roll to the person behind me, not sure how you can have no rolls period and then sell them right after you tell me no."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mory M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUPs8avgpY6Oe_Ytsg4rqTPRpKj-6YZ9I59NE5Wd6hmPPMEz98=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""My son tried the kids sushi and he liked the taste so he had to go for the second one😅\n\nHe also liked the kids sugar free apple juice."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNRUu5YD0Fietl_4iXu9MZrvAIKJrmCY2ZgbcE\u0026fid=0x0:0xd7238af858a364f2""],""When"":""2024-3-28""},{""Name"":""Romy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJV8-S3VeeKeT0pn9n2DdxFX14BmtdMp_HhzVdEx3f6OGeOaQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Been here last week, and got myself a chicken teriyaki bento with thin noodles, spring roll and california roll.

When I entered the store, the worker, Manpreet, was acting frazzled on the phone. When she finally looked up she asked how she can assist me, I shared I’m here to pick up an online order, Manpreet then said “okay, it’ll be a moment” and then she continued to loiter behind the counter and pacing back and forth on the phone. Then after she finally got off the phone she started to make, what I assumed, was my order which was 7 minutes after I Manpreet mentioned it would ‘just be a moment’. This was unacceptable as we had 2 young kids waiting in the car and hence why I believe placing an online order would have been a better idea. Manpreet also did not apologize for the late order or the inconvenience this has caused me. This was the first time I’d ever seen one individual working at subway, during dinner time, on a weekday night. This entire encounter was unprofessional by subway standards.

The Grinch meal wasn't cheap to begin with. At $16.89, you get a Big Mac combo meal with a pair of socks. When you add it up, its not a deal. You're paying for every item in it including the socks. You can't buy the socks directly but you can buy the toy only that comes with the child's happy meal.\n\nI noted they had a stack of Grinch boxes behind the cashier and yet they did not package my Grinch meal in it. Why tempt me and charge premium?\n\nThe child happy meal was in a regular box with no Grinch advertising at all. Another disappointment. We grabbed our meals and found the napkin dispenser was empty. First time, first McDonald's that supplies were depleted.  When we got home, we noticed we had the shaker bag and dill pickle package but no fries. Blasting mad, I jumped back into my car, drove back to McDonald's and complained. There was no apology. The cashier grabbed some fries and gave it to me.

The course has a nice layout, and they kept the first long par 5 hole from the old executive. It has a great mix of long and short doglegs and water features. The drainage on rainy days I thought is very good and it's in sunny Tsawwassen. So the weather is always great for playing.

It was as if the phone was set on a table and left. Quiet. But I could faintly hear people in the background. I say “hello?hello?” But nothing. 15 seconds later I’m hung up on. Call back the store. Someone answers and says I need to call back at 6pm to speak to a manager. I call at 6:12pm. Manager isn’t in today, he is at Ladner- call there. So I do. He takes down my number and says he will call at 4pm the following day. Guess what? Doesn’t call.\n\nThese guys just don’t care at all about serving good food or you having a good experience.

experience and last experience at this TH.   The drive through young woman charged me over $7 for steeped tea and a croissant with plain cream cheese.  I asked her why it was such a high price today???   She didn't answer just started to give me my tea and then a water bottle.  I had not ordered a water bottle.  She said l did. I had ordered a cup of water.   She gave me back my money and then got another order to deal with.  I drove away without my sandwich.  I came back and went inside and told the girl at the til.  She said she saw me get my money for my sandwich back from the drive through girl.  I had to argue with her that was for the water bottle l did not order.  .  Then she kept backing up her co worker.   The girl at the drive through forgot to HAND me my sandwich after she had to refund that water bottle.  Holy talk about two rude young women.\nI think the two men who run the driveway through are very rude but they are great compared to these two young women.   I also think some of the drive through staff talk way to fast.   It seems like a competition to them to get everyone in and out fast.  This person. At the window was talking way to fast too.  Good grief.  Slow down.\n\nTrain your staff better!!!!!\n\nI have heard many people upset about the staff in this particular place.  You are loosing customers.  There are no long line ups at this TH like at Starbucks on Canoe Dr.  Maybe a short rush at lunch sometimes but not really compared to other TH.\n\nThey need to learn some skills for dealing with the public.\nI will never go back to this place.\n\nThis article does not include the few wonderful polite ones they have there.

Firstly, they took the wrong order, Secondly, they kept the order on the counter and didn't even call for it. When we asked if it was our order, they had no clue the guy who took the order literally said to his coworker \""I have no idea whose order is this\"". We were confused too, because we ordered Oreo ice cap and it was a normal ice cap. But, later he confirmed it was our order. But when we went to call out for the wrong order, it's hard to get hold of them, they act so busy when there are hardly 1 customers and they are 6-7 servers. Then the person insisted, we have ordered the normal ice cap ( trying to say, we were wrong), but changed the order later and took too long, almost cleared all orders before our's. No wonders why the store hardly had any customer.\n\nLastly when we asked to talk to manager, he was the same guy who took our order. Even we were speechless, if the manager doesn't know what he is doing, I can imagine the team. In customer service Half of the battle i lost, when you have a uninterested face while talking to customer, and these guys was uninterested to take the order and deliver the right one.\n\nAll the staff including the manager are so busy when there is no rush, I don't understand how?, when I was calling a guy, literally standing next to the counter, he ignored as if he didn't listen, after 4 loud calls. Guys if you want customer to wait despite listening to customers call, please ask the customer to wait, don't straight away ignore. All the faces were full of disappointment and feel like they don't wanna work. I have been to such busy Tim's where they have 50 orders at a time, still they smile, and treat customers the way they should be treated. At least call for the order when it's ready. Uninterested faces while taking orders, rude looks when someone is calling out for wrong order, will not make your life easy, it will piss off the other person, ruin their mood and endup in a bad review.\n\nAnd when I saw the reviews of this place, no wonders there were a lot of people not happy with the service. TH Management please look at it, you are losing customers. If the staff don't wanna work, please change them, because looking at the reviews I am sure they don't wanna improve themselves.\n\nI am not visiting this Tim's again, but this is concerning for Tim Hortons management, so many complaints from one particular branch.

From the moment we stepped inside, we were welcomed by a cozy, inviting atmosphere. But what really made our evening special was the incredible service we received from our server, Jas.\n\nJas was simply wonderful. She greeted us with the kind of smile that makes you feel right at home. Even though she was taking care of several tables and handling all sorts of requests, she never missed a beat. It was clear she’s incredibly hardworking, yet she made it all look effortless.\n\nOne thing that really stood out was how much Jas knew about the menu. She didn’t just take our order; she helped us choose, offering suggestions that perfectly matched what we were in the mood for. Whether it was deciding on the best appetizers, entrées, or the perfect drink, Jas had great recommendations for everything. Her knowledge of the cocktails, whiskey, and bourbon options was impressive, and her suggestions made our meal even more enjoyable.\n\nAnd speaking of the food—it was fantastic. Tasty Indian Bistro really lives up to its name. Every dish was packed with flavor and beautifully presented. You could tell the chefs put a lot of care into each plate, and it made the whole experience even better.\n\nBut honestly, it was Jas who made the night memorable. She was so friendly and attentive, making us feel like we were her top priority, even though we knew she had plenty of other tables to look after. It’s rare to find someone who’s not only great at their job but does it with such genuine warmth.\n\nAll in all, our dinner at Tasty Indian Bistro was a great experience. The food was delicious, and Jas’s outstanding service made the evening special. If you’re looking for a place with amazing food and even better service, Tasty Indian Bistro should definitely be on your list."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOCQeqGjvYvdLALA1ahCXbrag7z4jLhNunAsJn6\u0026fid=0x0:0xa3ae60553b040e35""],""When"":""2024-8-31""},{""Name"":""sreedevi radhakrishnan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVbgXwP26_52lKSsrN3V_BQpBNEYeYagTgwp1HSsvPT4knUcusU=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Absolutely phenomenal food!

Let me tell you about Beach Grove Motel. We booked the “last room available” before our ferry. We did not last 2 hours before checking out (and most of that time was not spent at the location). The room was disgusting - The room has uneven floor with gaps in the flooring, gaps in the door, table in the kitchenette “steadied” with a chunk of paper. Left over premade ice left in the fridge from god knows when and the ac didn’t come to the front room. The beds were dirty, the back room was gross and grungy, walls and baseboards had soo much wear and tear throughout the unit it looked like it was a “slumlord” special. The bathroom was disgusting, the tub was not rinsed out after there “cleaning”, the toilet seat was broken and holding on by one clip, fecal matter on the walls and stained towels. The utility closet was full of mouse poop and traps. The fire alarm was unplugged and the fire extinguisher hadn’t been serviced in over 5 years (well past the expiration date). Window in the bathroom did not have a screen. There were left over cleaning cloths left in the room.\n\nI have attempted to contact the manager to discuss matters but they have sat on our messages for over a month. This place still charged us for the full stay even though we did not stay.\n\nOverall very negative experience at this location.\n\nUpdate as you can see from the managements response they are not taking responsibility of the cleanliness of the site and are thinking I am looking for something more than letting others be aware of the conditions. I will expand upon their response -\n\n1) the utility closet was not locked as they stated below.\n\n2) I don’t believe for a minute that they would resolve the issues with the 5 year expired extinguisher, broken toilet seat or the cleanliness of the unit. Clearly trying to save face.

again May 2023:\nKids treated us to a Mother’s Day lunch and food, portions and service were very good.

Unfortunately it had not, food is plunked on the corner of the table without any acknowledgement. Nobody came back to check on tea/water refills. Requested the bill and same. Food was ok but the service leaves a bad taste in the mouth and doesn’t warrant a return IMO. Doesn’t seem to affect the local customer loyalty though as it’s been this way for years.\nDemoting to 1 star.\n\nGot take out beef noodle bowl (Phō)- large #6 well done brisket and skirt flank-$10.99. Soup was very hot but not as flavourful as Phō99 which is our go-to, but closed. Comes with generous portion of beef and the usual sprouts, cilanto, lime, basil, jalapeño and hoisin sauce.\nHadn’t been for couple years, while the owners are very nice, friendly people, the servers have not always been very attentive (to the point of being rude) in the past.\nThe food has always been quite good though.\nLocated in a strip mall with a variety of businesses and ample parking."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOnZ3Ufs7YsPQXmcMlvLnP0b-99yAaE24QWZ-s\u0026fid=0x0:0x80f8ec4ed8554885""],""When"":""2022-2-22""},{""Name"":""Ronald Retandy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKiVTWQFKjqXe4UnsBFRIZ7GxF9tGrva9JzQ7uYayyA9RXk6w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Been going here for more than 20 years, I heard it was operating under a new owner last year.

Place is quaint and homey. Floors were a little slippery though, not sure if it's really that way. Anyway, the lone server was very soft-spoken and nice and kindly explained the menu for kids as we had our toddler with us. The lighting was a bit dimmer than I liked but they had these little oil tea lights on the table but server did not light it up because of our toddler which we appreciated.\n\nThe food took a while even though we were the only ones there. But it made up for the wait as the food was really good. The flavours were amazing. We had the roast lamb, chicken skaras, and kalamari which were perfect. The portions were huge and we still had one container full of leftover after dinner was over.\n\nWe used to go to this now-closed restaurant near our place and the flavours were a hit or miss as sometimes it's too salty or too bland.

My wife and I each had different lamb entrees, which come from New Zealand. There was a saltiness to the meat, but it only enhanced the flavour rather than another it. The potatoes were infused with some sort of lemony zest, while topped with some sort of mustard that wasn't overpowering, still allowing for the potato to be enjoyed, rather than covering it up completely. And the rice wasn't a filler, but rather something I couldn't bear to miss a single grain, devouring the entire platter. Oh yeah, did I mention the salad? The sour and the freshness of the olive oil was so refreshing, balancing the flavours from the savoury bits.\n\nThe portions were sizeable. Thank goodness I forgot to eat lunch that day. The service was limited, as it's a small mom and pop type of shop. But the place was full on a Tuesday night, along with take out in what looked like a 2 person operation. And even then, the food didn't take long to come out.\n\nSo thoroughly impressed by this hidden gem in Delta!

Now I totally appreciate that this is fast food and I am at the ferry terminal on new years eve but still… I ordered a vegetarian quesadilla with guacamole on the side. Not especially challenging. (Or so I thought.) What did I get? A dry tortilla with a thin layer of corn, tomatoes, and black beans that was warmed up on a grill. Sounds like a quesadilla, right? No - it wasn’t. There was NO friggin’ cheese to hold the contents in the tortilla, so every time I picked up one of the tiny little bite-size pieces that the woman behind the counter chopped the quesadilla into (why???), the contents fell out because there was nothing to bind it to the tortilla. Couldn’t dip it in the salsa or the sour cream - OR the nonexistent guacamole that I paid an extra $3 for but that they just never gave me. I’ve attached a photo of the contents left at the bottom of the take away container. My hand is next to it to give some size context. (I can’t believe I paid $15 for this!)\n\nThe Icing on the cake was when I dialled the number on their website to try to arrange for some sort of refund and the recorded female voice said very unenthusiastically “Yeah, you can leave a message” - but no, I actually couldn’t because the friggin’ mailbox was full! (Of course it was…)\n\nEven though the four women were behind the counter were very sweet, just avoid this place. They are really unclear on the concept.\n\n(For the record the reference number on my receipt dated Dec 31 @ 6:26pm  is 633596 and I paid $14.69 on my debit card should anybody care to reimburse me…)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM5fJQ7dCqHVmGPkedDjON0g2ywzSFghI9YghJO\u0026fid=0x0:0xfad1578e12b30ee6""],""When"":""2024-1-1""}]",

It wasn't too busy during dinner time on a Sunday and I was able to get seated right away.\n\nI ordered the following:\n- Kabuli Palaw \u0026 Lamb Shank\n- Beef Kebab\n- Qaimaq Chai (pink tea)\n\nThe Kabuli Palaw \u0026 Lamb Shank was delicious. The lamb meat came right off the bone and complimented the rice really well. The flavors and texture of the dish were great, it reminds me of Biryani which I also love. One Con I would say about the dish is that the side of potatoes and the sauces could be a bit more generous in my opinion.\n\nI also ordered a side of beef kebab which I thought was great flavor wise, but it did seem a bit dry in my opinion.\n\nTo top off my meal I decided to try out the Qaimaq Chai (Afghan Pink Tea). It does take some time to prepare since it's made to order, but it was definitely worth it! It was creamy, refreshing and hot to help digest the food.\n\nService here was great, and the staff were friendly. Interior was clean and cozy with good lighting. Only thing I would mention is regarding the seating - the tables are a bit on the taller side, so unless you're a tall person then it might feel slightly awkward when eating, but honestly it's not a huge deal, just something I observed while dining in. Also they do have TV's inside the restaurant but I noticed it was just being used to play Spotify music - would be pretty nice to have a variety of Afghani music videos playing or something or maybe just have it on the sports channel.\n\nThere's plenty of free parking in this lot, so you'll never have to worry about finding where to park. The place is relatively easy to get to as well. It's just along Scott Road (120 ST).\n\nOverall, this is a nice place to grab some Afghani food here in Surrey.

Medhu vada and podi idli were fresh and tasty appetizers as always. Mixed veg parotta, pav bhaji, and tomato onion chilli uthappam are reliable dishes for adults and have been consistently good. Kids got chocolate dosas, essentially ghee dosa with Nutella spread inside. This does not come with sambar and chutney on the side for some strange reason, previously it used to. Kids didn’t seem to be bothered.  Kids had Shirley temple, adults had mango lassi and filter coffee, both were good. Food is not very expensive in relative terms. $116 with taxes and gratuity, the latter is included in the bill. Shruti was warm, friendly and quick to serve.  Overall good experience.

Double thumbs up 👍🏻 👍🏻.\n\nPhilly Cheese Steak Burger\nIt's good, but the meat is not that much.

The service could be a bit better.  For example, the waitress took away the bucket that had our utensils and paper napkins to refill but didn't bring it back.  Another situation was when our water jug was empty but none of the waitresses (3 of them) just stood around by the bar and didn't offer to help refill it.\n\nNow to the food ... my family ordered the Chicken 65 Semi-Dry Appetizer, Veg Hakka Noodles, Roti, Parantha, and Hyderabad Goat Dum Biryani.\n\nThe Chicken 65 was ordered non-spicy but it came with a punch.  It was super tasty with the spices and spicyness so luckily we ordered the noodles, roti and parantha to help offset it.  Noodles were delicious however the roti and parantha was just alright.  the star of the meal was the biryani.  It was our first time  trying Hyderabad biryani and it didn't disappoint.  The goat was very flavourful and spicy (even though we asked for non-spicy) so luckily the Raita helped cool the spicy level down.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this restaurant.

Declining Quality at The Yellow Chilli\n\nI recently ordered from Yellow Chilli, and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. The packaging was inadequate—there was minimal effort to secure the food, and it arrived in a messy state, with items spilled and containers damaged. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected much better care in how the food is packaged and delivered.\n\nTo make matters worse, the quality of the food itself seems to have declined. The flavors weren't as vibrant or fresh as I remember, and the texture was off, indicating the ingredients weren’t as fresh as they should have been.\n\nFor a restaurant with a reputation for excellence, both the packaging and food quality were major letdowns. I hope The Yellow Chilli takes this feedback seriously and works to restore the standards they once set.

Originally we were seated at a table for two that was quite dark because of the lack of lighting in the area, so I had requested to our server if we could move to a brighter table behind us which she granted. The main reason for this is because I am not of a fan of eating in the dark, and as a food critic/reviewer, I like to see what I am eating clearly so I can provide better feedback.\n\nWe ordered the following for two people:\n* Tikka 3 Ways\n* Bhatti ki Macchi\n* Garlic Naan\n* Missi Rotti\n* Puran Singh Da Tariwala Murgh\n* Dum murgh biryani\n* Falooda Kulfi\n\nI ordered the tikka 3 ways for my appetizer and it was really good! I love that it was done 3 ways so I can taste which one I like the most...the spicy one was my favorite. The cook on the chicken was perfect and not dry.\n\nFor our mains we got the chef's special Puran Singh Da Tariwala Murgh and Chicken Biryani. For my bread I ordered the garlic naan and my Indian buddy ordered the missi rotti. Everything tasted delicious! The gravy was rich, savory, with a bit of spice and the chicken biryani was piping hot and cooked perfectly! 👌\n\nThe garlic naan was soft, flaky and fresh! The texture was really good and perfect for dipping into the curry. The only con my Indian buddy said was the missi rotti was slightly overcooked.\n\nOverall though the appetizers and mains were delicious.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the Falooda Kulfi and all I have to say is...WOW! The ice cream dessert was bursting with Indian flavours...I felt like I teleported to India when I ate a spoon full of this delicious creamy dessert. This was definitely the star of the meal tonight! I am not a huge dessert guy - but this one I truly enjoyed...I also like that it wasn't overly sweet. 🍨🍧\n\nThe service here was excellent. Our server refilled our waters regularly and even educated me with some of the food I was ordering and eating. She also made sure we were getting new plates, silverware and napkins for each course. 👍\n\nInterior and seating was also good. The table is a nice height and the chairs are padded. The only con is that some of the tables here are placed in darker areas of the restaurant...I guess it's fine if you prefer candle light dinners, but in my opinion there should be a bit more lighting that stretches across the wall where the tables are since they are further away from the glass windows and get blocked out by the higher booth seating which makes those areas feel less important.\n\nOverall though, I enjoyed eating here and plan to eat here again to try their other menu items. I am a big fan of Indian food since I grew up in Surrey, so it's nice to be able to treat myself with some indian fine dining once in a while. 🙂"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMH7Apd1e8CNCeuPqPQ0X62CSoitNmB2nZ6-8Eu\u0026fid=0x0:0x59e2c461f803f0ec""],""When"":""2024-9-1""},{""Name"":""Gunjan N"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKnGgkA1elJAwarcjcQNB0nZVdXLX3uwLu0NnIClSVktMj-5Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Being an avid follower of Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, this place did not live up to its chef's mark.

The dessert was on the house and repeat order of the tandoori lamb at no charge to take  home as a sorry.  Taste wise, the batter  used for prawns was too salty. Other dishes were very tasty. It was a let down  for me as I was expecting  better than what  I got at Sanjeev Kapoor  restaurant.   The ambiance  was dull, the place was empty, and the food presentation  was very mediocre. Not the Sanjeev Kapoor  flair that I expected.

Had that darker look where it has been re deep fried twice or thrice over.\nThe yam roll was so so, the yam itself was still crunchy and not soft or thoroughly cooked.

It is a family owned business and the couple are extremely nice and humbling.  They have a couple of tables inside if you want to eat in. It reminds me of a indian street food place.  A great feeling.  Love street food in india. Make sure you tell them to.make it medium spicy and add cilantro and garlic. I always recommend this place to my friends.

Then she gave me two tiny containers of jalapeños on the side, like that was supposed to make up for it. It was so disappointing. I'm so sick of this place. They have no respect for their customers' time or money. If you're thinking about ordering from them, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

in Delta but was always known to our family as awesome pizza with amazing crust which is very hard to find around here.

When in doubt throw it out, I will always stick by that nothing is worth getting Yourself or your family sick. I just don’t understand how this went unnoticed at a restaurant and in this time, and we spent so much to having food ordered in is such a luxury that not many of us can afford to have this experience to the upmost disappointment.

When I received my order, but upon reaching home, I discovered that the hashbrowns, a water bottle, and the Happy Meal box were missing. I immediately called the store to report the issue but received no response. After several attempts, the manager, Ravneet, finally answered the call. When I inquired about the missing items, she told me that they had been left on the counter, implying that it was my mistake for not picking them up.\n\nDespite explaining the situation, Ravneet did not make any effort to resolve the issue or offer any assistance. She spoke in a dismissive and rude manner, which I found completely unacceptable. As a loyal McDonald's customer, I expect better treatment and respect, not only as a consumer but also in my interactions with staff.\n\nI request that the management team review this matter and provide an apology for Ravneet's unprofessional conduct.

To make matters worse, the burger buns were stale around the edges, further diminishing the overall experience.\n\nThe dining area itself was no better. Tables were visibly dirty and had not been cleaned in some time, with trash scattered around. To my shock, some individuals were even laying on the floors, creating a chaotic and uninviting atmosphere for guests.\n\nWhat truly baffled me, however, was learning that this location does not honor complimentary drink refills for dine-in customers—a staple of the McDonald’s experience. It seems this franchise has chosen to deviate from the brand's norms and impose its own rules, leaving customers frustrated.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the manager’s demeanor was outright rude when I inquired about the refill policy. Rather than addressing the concern with understanding, their dismissive attitude left a bitter taste far worse than the stale bun. I’ll be contacting corporate to seek clarity on whether this practice and approach are acceptable."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMFN7h8Qm4g5lUgQvMk6XF4G8xQaSTeyNCWYc5u\u0026fid=0x0:0x6cfb50410b1b5274""],""When"":""2024-11-19""},{""Name"":""Adarsh Sivaprasad"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX4wLIi14ujjNuOiI0zrnXjP7vBI45ELITWJKrDSR6Rnzad9GvH=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Dear McDonald's Customer Service Team,\n\nI am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the service I received at one of your locations. On [insert date], I placed an order that included four items, one of which was a box of chicken nuggets. However, upon receiving my order, I noticed that the chicken nuggets were missing. I immediately contacted the store to resolve the issue, but the response I received was far from satisfactory.\n\nFirstly, when I called to report the missing item, the person on the phone provided a service that I found to be unprofessional. Not only was the resolution unclear, but the individual did not communicate the order code audibly, making the situation more frustrating.\n\nWhen I visited the store in person to show my receipt and explain the situation, the staff did not even take the time to properly listen to my concern. Instead, they reacted by criticizing me and were unwilling to address the issue. I expected better from a global brand like McDonald’s, especially in terms of customer service and professionalism.\n\nWhile the missing item was valued at only $8, it is not the amount but the principle of customer satisfaction and trust that is at stake. I believe that paying for an item and not receiving it constitutes a breach of trust, and the unprofessional handling of this issue only compounded my disappointment.\n\nI kindly request that this matter be looked into and resolved appropriately. I would appreciate a refund for the missing item and any necessary action taken to ensure that this type of experience is not repeated for other customers."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOvNiaHAP01J5-MTpzLi8PhWRxwcLKXsq4qKJsI\u0026fid=0x0:0x6cfb50410b1b5274""],""When"":""2024-10-18""},{""Name"":""amita Morker"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKvsZ5qFZb-WRJWkXiKEOAHm9ZqJPpaPiYkMLb4GWEfgDE0Wg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Rude service.

I was having a craving for fish and chips. I found the Britannia Brewing right across the street from my location. I walked into an inviting trendy at Chic restaurant. I was met by a lovely lady and taken to a table. I'm not someone who likes to try new things and when I notice the fish and chips wasn't the typical fish and chips I was skeptical. I spoke to my waitress and she explained the dish in detail. She knows her menu. Well. I found the staff to be dressed in comfortable yet professional manner making the place feel very relaxed and inviting. I did order the fish and chips and they were the best I've ever had. The batter was not thick and over breaded nor was it greasy. The flavor was delicious! They gave me two large pieces and french fries. I love the homemade tartar sauce. I ordered a pop as well and they even brought a slice of lime in there which I thought was a nice touch. I'm especially impressed with the fact that they have three bathrooms. One is wheelchair accessible tastefully decorated. In fact the whole restaurant is tastefully decorated!

Great ambience, service and food. It took me back to my back home days to see those Indian softdrinks, biscuits, and snacks. You can have Limca, fanta, Parley cookies and other snacks. Perfect desi feel.\n\nWe ordered Coffe, chai, Samosa cones and Bombay sandwitch. I must admit, I haven't found such a good Indian coffee in Surrey so far. Its exactly how we make coffee at back home. Luved it. Also meeting partners said the chai is awesome. Bombay sandwich is typical desi style how they make it in India on road side trucks. Good taste. Samosa are also good but I would say it could have been done better. But not disappointed. So awesome food. They have got many other items to taste but it was my business meeting and could not explore their full menu. Definitely a good place to hangout with friends and family for a tea/coffe and samosa, especially on a Rainy day in Vancouver. They also have special desi style frappuccinos .. must be good choice on a hot  sunny day. thank you Chaiwala for bringing this home experience to us in Surrey. keep growing and we want to see you like another Tim hortons or starbucks.

I finally got the chance and I'm not disappointed. Came here at 4pm on a Wednesday and got the AYCE Dinner menu.\n\nI don't get why other reviewers had a bad impression about this place, but I didn't see anything that was a major concern. On the contrary, it's one of the better AYCE sushi places I've been too. Sure the sushi might seemed like it had more rice to them (not all rolls, but some), but this is a AYCE place. You won't find a AYCE/Buffet that doesn't add extra starch or whatnot to bulk up the food. The sashimi is limited to 20 pieces per person and a bit smaller then the usual gigantic pieces and the negiri is definitely half the size of a regular piece you'd find anywhere else; the fish/topping they don't skimp on either. The tempura is crispy/crunchy, the prawns are regular sized and the yam are half pieces. The gyoza was nicely crispy as well. Personally, I would get the chicken teriyaki. I was hoping for a more crispy skin, but it fell flat when it arrived to the table; it could've been the sauce though, but the chicken did seem a little dry/tough.\n\nWhen I think of this place now, I think of sensible/petite pieces. Which is great because it gives you a chance to try other things on the menu. The service was quick and the servers are attentive. The best thing is they don't even skimp on your food. I've gone to many other AYCEs and when you order, you're missing a few items; hoping they you eventually forget. This place doesn't do that. They give you everything you order.\n\nOverall, a very good experience and I recommend you check it out if you have a hankering for Japanese food. I'll definitely be back in the future."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOHVUVgNqPgi7AzBh04eT7xScIjalP8gqxI0wUE\u0026fid=0x0:0xbae6aeffcd1b7d0""],""When"":""2024-2-22""},{""Name"":""Betty Orellana Murcia"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUcu6WKHpuVOgrfNampCwsacpBebTY8L5h4jd9AMWFBpcWJweAvAA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""One of my families favourite restaurants!

Soon after, she stood awkwardly by the entrance as the channel switched to football instead.\n\nTo the owner: Was saving $70 worth more than keeping loyal customers?

The chips were placed on a piece of tortilla so once yoyu've eaten all the chips, you could fold the tortilla and eat it with toppings that fell into it. Thought it was a great idea. The chips however were not crunchy. It was like stale chips that have been re-baked.\nThe beef dip was good. Good size and flavor. Ordered it with a side of ceasar salad thinking who messes up salads. Well, if you like eating whole cloves of baked garlic, then this is for you. I was not expecting to find a whole piece of garlic clove when I took a bite off my salad and it threw me off. Not sure if it was intentional but not a fan. Who wants to walk around the casino with garlic breath anyway.\nBeing it was a slow saturday afternoon - there were only about 5 tables around us-' we expected the washrooms to be clean. The ladies room was kept clean but hubby was disgusted with the mens room, described it as if it was not cleaned from the drinking that occured the night before.

Boy, what a surprise! They serve Fat Tug IPA on the tap! I started going there regularly, first for the beer, then I discovered their excellent food selection and made friends with their friendly staff.\nYou guessed it, I love this pub.

Before I could get started the very professional server brought a new summer dish for me to offer an opinion and I’m not much for salmon cooked, but this generous 5oz patty was seasoned nicely and I think some green onion and maybe a grain or something to hold the Fresh Salmon together won my 2 thumbs up.\n\nThey set this huge feast upon me and I showed that meal who is Boss and you should too🇨🇦🙏❤️"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPWXA1MYxQT661IKkXmmT_ELHaOhqXwmmjlAKWY\u0026fid=0x0:0xd626b0bb5c92372c""],""When"":""2024-7-5""},{""Name"":""Jameela A"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIGmIjT4W8Bo17-ggNSzxcoDgtO-KQSSmnpYgy_oZo7qm1k2w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I ordered a large amount of sushi for a work event.

It deserves an 8 out of 10.\n\nOverview: Dana Pani Indian Cuisine stands out as one of our favorite Indian restaurants and a hidden gem in the area. We visited for a quick bite and were thoroughly impressed by the quality and flavor of the dishes.\n\nFood:\n\n•\tAppetizer: We started with a large portion of vegetable pakora. These were excellently prepared, with a perfect fry and a well-balanced seasoning blend. The appetizer sets a promising tone for the meal and merits an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tMain Course: We opted for the Tiffin Thali, a diverse and satisfying selection that included both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, rice, naan, and raita.\n\n•\tPalak Paneer: This dish, a staple of North Indian cuisine, features paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a rich, flavorful spinach-based sauce. The spinach is blanched and pureed to a smooth consistency, then sautéed with onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes, along with a medley of spices. It was expertly prepared and rates an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tChicken Tikka Masala: Known for its vibrant orange color and rich, creamy, spiced tomato-based sauce, this dish did not disappoint. The balance of flavors and the aromatic quality of the sauce were excellent. It earns an 8 out of 10.\n\n•\tChana Masala: This dish features chickpeas cooked in a spicy and tangy tomato-onion gravy. It is a staple in Indian cuisine, celebrated for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. While tasty, it lacked the depth of flavor found in the other dishes and receives a 7 out of 10.\n\n•\tButter Chicken: A personal favorite, this dish featured a creamy, luscious sauce with tender, delicious chicken. It stood out as the highlight of the meal and deserves a 9 out of 10.\n\nAmbiance: The ambiance is modest but comfortable. While the space is small, it is adequately maintained and provides a cozy setting for dining.\n\nPrice: The pricing is very affordable, making it an excellent option for those seeking quality Indian cuisine without breaking the bank.\n2/5\n\nVerdict: Dana Pani Indian Cuisine is truly a hidden gem and one of the best Indian restaurants in the area. The variety and quality of the food are outstanding, and the affordability adds to its appeal. For those who enjoy spicy food, it’s worth noting that while the dishes are flavorful, they cater to various spice preferences, offering non-spicy, medium, and very hot options. Overall, it’s a restaurant we will certainly return to and highly recommend."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO5yhzePV_P4zOnZyLnxZOBpAWD7VNYor1BubP0\u0026fid=0x0:0xe029e562e7fb717a""],""When"":""2024-6-27""},{""Name"":""Chris Lochhead"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJuiipc_xz9ET6nJtGoC_1SL7eafro7oB6Q-WiHyZ8PyZyITQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This place is a hidden New Westminster gem.

We started eating it. At this point I realized under one of the pizzas was something that looks like a mostly eaten garlic bread!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She said she will bring it to her manager and did not come back since.\n\nWhile eating the other 2 plates we noticed smaller things we could live without complaining to them.

I couldn't resist mys self to try this Thaali. I am big fan of Indian Thalis.\n\nThey said, You can choose any Curry from their menu for Thaali, which surprised me (that means they make  fresh curry for only for your Thali). I have chosen non-veg Thali (13.49$) option which comes with one veg and one chicken Curry (no lamb and shrimp included in Thali), one plain naan, Rice and Raita. I have selected Karahi Paneer (veg Curry)  and Chicken tikka Masala ( non-veg Curry). The ambience is good, very clean and good service. The food is not at it's best but I can say it's worth for the given price. It is far better than eating junk food by paying 20$ on your work day lunch. The paneer Currey is 4 out of 5, but they should work on chicken tikka masala. I didn't find any taste in it. But the quality of food is good. The naan is very plain, they should offer Garlic naan to make the Thaali more tasty. Rice is of good quality they have used. Raita is fresh. Overall I am not disappointed,  although I expected a better Chicken tikka masala which is a basic chicken curry in any Indian place and it shouldn't go wrong.\n\nOverall I appreciate this restaurant team for their efforts to offer Thali at such low price yet quoty food. You don't even get a burger or sandwich from McD  for that price in these inflation days. Also, the girl at front was friendly and did good job.\n\nI wanted to try Chana bathura next time.\n\nThank you."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN0XMLgOx4y_8kqS_FWesvvQNTC3Funx6F9Rev4\u0026fid=0x0:0xf0212ded0051493f""],""When"":""2024-6-13""},{""Name"":""Sathiyaseelan Suhashini"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWGCDhZwAvUF3Q8iMEpEx8TQCvKbwiXzYFJN0uOrenEt7v0wxGX=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Loved the sweets which are delicious.

However, last night as my son and I returned from our 12th salmon fishing trip to the BC coast, (which we have been doing since he was eight years old), I began thinking about all of lodges that we have stayed at over the past decade or so.  During that time we have fished at 9 different BC salmon lodges.  I realized that out of all of the fishing lodges that we have stayed at, Duncanby Lodge has remained, in our minds, the best overall fishing lodge that we have ever stayed at. Their accommodations have been the best, their meal plans were fantastic, their boats and equipment is great, their owner and staff were more then dedicated to helping to ensure that their guests catch fish, and everyone at the lodge treats you like family.  Although my boy and I did not catch many fish at Duncanby on that trip, that was not because the fish were not there.  It was only because of our inexperience at that time, with fishing for salmon.  However, even though we had not paid for a guide, the owner cared enough to have a guide take us out one afternoon, giving my son his first opportunity to catch bottom fish. The people at Duncanby simply cared about us, and took the time to ensure that we had a great trip.  I have watched their web site over the years, and it is obvious that they are still treating their guests just as great.  This is evidenced in the fact that they are always booked for a year in advance.   The only reason that we have never been back is because I can’t plan so far in advance. Ultimately, I wanted to write this review to let others know that with all of the experience that we have gained at eight other salmon fishing lodges over the years, Duncanby has been the best one of them all."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNr7SCYQwGO5kH7vqsS5cMGYSHRO1V1McugvtuL\u0026fid=0x0:0x6621c68d52a349fb""],""When"":""2018-7-23""},{""Name"":""whatthefuk4"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU6LEi31F-If0ZN1nUlwh1yJvDZQpCsFPxdXQdaeAHMr0ETGp4j=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""One of the most serene places on Earth.

But majority of the bad reviews are people who have never eaten at a pho restaurant. Seriously, if you’ve been at pho restaurant, you know they leave a container of chopsticks, napkins and soup spoons on each table so the patrons can use.\n\nI keep reading the word hygiene on the negative reviews and this place seems a lot better than many Vancouver restaurants. Tables are clean, chopsticks, spoons, dishes all clean. And on top of that, the bean sprouts were extremely fresh and crisp.\n\nWe ordered pho. The broth is light yet flavourful. A bit low on the salt side which is a major plus for me. I add extra sriracha as my ‘salt’.\n\nThe pho is great.

Green Lettuce for the first time, and while the ambiance was lovely and inviting, the overall experience left me with mixed feelings.\n\nWe were excited to try the food, and I have to say, the dishes didn’t disappoint in terms of flavor. The Green Lettuce Hot and Spicy Tofu was tasty and beautifully presented. The Tofu with Eggplant in BBQ Sauce was flavorful, and the Manchurian Fried Rice with Vegetables was enjoyable too, though a bit oily. In fact, most dishes seemed slightly too oily, which might not suit everyone’s taste.\n\nHowever, the service and overall professionalism left a lot to be desired. The server seemed rushed and lacked a welcoming attitude, which made us feel a bit overlooked. The kitchen team and staff were talking loudly in Tagalog, which felt unprofessional and made the environment uncomfortable. To make things worse, one of the staff members was eating at the front counter, which didn’t create a good impression.\n\nTo top it off, I was charged for takeaway containers and a bag without being informed beforehand. This was totally unacceptable, as I wouldn’t have agreed to pay for containers just to pack leftover food. Restaurants should always inform customers before adding such charges to the bill.\n\nWhile the food was nice, these issues with service and hidden charges really need to be addressed for a better overall experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOXAajGfM2sn3p8B-aFicLrj9Q-FcRifkxzO3pW\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b3f087653f3c65""],""When"":""2024-11-28""},{""Name"":""Liz Rahiman"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLf_WAFTMczKN_GsPw8DV_ml7-UU2Elq3CK0W-VyX1oLU1MqQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""Ok so I already know a lot of people aren't going to be happy with what I have to say.\nWe ordered take our from the surrey, the food was cooked in 30 mins for these dishes\nSweet and sour chicken\nMongolian beef\nSliced chicken with broccoli\nLamb with green onions\nBeef fried rice\nBlack bean chicken\n\nThe food was good but the portion was awful and flavour betweenthe soy\nsauce heavy dishes was minor. There was a total of 6 slices of beef in the Mongolian beef, it was just filled with veggies. The chicken with broccoli was a decent portion but the chicken was cut up to smaller than bite size portion to give the illusion of a full container. The lamb was also decent, but for the price tag it wasn't great. The fried rice had again a total of maybe 9 small slices of beef. The black bean chicken was again heavy with veggies and minimum chicken pieces.\n\nThis was the most disappointing take outs I have ever had. My guest was also pretty disappointed.\n\nThe person who we paid seemed upset that we didn't tip for our take out...it's take out! There was zero service.

We were seated twenty mins after arrival and not in the lounge which we booked, but in the lobby bar (table wasn’t even wiped down) By this point we just sat down because we were tired of waiting and had gotten valet parking. Hostess mentioned we have a hour and half, which I found so unprofessional when it’s listed upon booking and we would be out in a hour anyway for an event.

Everything was perfect for our special day, and the atmosphere in the Executive Room made the event feel even more intimate and special.\nThe entire team at Glowbal made our wedding reception so special, and we couldn’t have asked for a better venue.

Creek offers a unique ambiance that's on the darker side, which some might find appealing, though it’s not to my taste. Their cocktails are a highlight—I'd highly recommend the Spicy Mango Margarita; it's exceptional.\n\nThe appetizers are decent. The wings are tasty, but the fries are pretty standard, and the nachos are just okay. Unfortunately, the main course falls short. The pizzas, especially the Meat Lovers, were overly salty and perhaps some of the worst I’ve had in Vancouver. The fish and chips were disappointingly bland, and needing to request salt for a dish is far from ideal.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t recommend Mahony's for the main course.

We had a seat in the corner. That was not a good location. There were lots of propane tanks next to us that is both hazard and nothing standard in any restaurant.
