Earls Station Square for my birthday. Laren was our sever for the evening and he was great until an order mix up which put a damper on the rest of our time at Earls.\n\nI ordered the Cajun Blackened Chicken but instead was served a salmon dish. When I informed Laren about the wrong order, I was met with doubt and annoyance. Laren did not offer to correct the mistake right away and it seemed he wanted to persuade me to keep the salmon. At no point did Laren show accountability for his mistake nor did he apologize for it, it almost appeared that he casted blame my way like I misremembered what I ordered. I had deliberated between a burger and the Cajun Blackened Chicken when I reviewed the menu, not once did I even consider the salmon. I honestly felt gaslit by Laren during this whole interaction… I was certain I ordered the chicken…\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to share a proper meal with my family on my birthday. By the time the correct dish was served, my parents were already finished with their food. What was supposed to be a joyous occasion was shadowed by Laren’s poor attitude and the awkward atmosphere that followed the conversation about the mix up. I felt it was obvious he avoided our table the rest of the evening while he was attentive to others around us. We also waited quite a while for our bill, which furthered the frustration.\n\nThe food somewhat compensated for the poor customer service. All of our dishes were delicious and well made. In addition, I was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary brownie at the end of our meal (not the birthday dessert special, which I felt too awkward to ask Laren about).\n\nAlthough the food was very appetizing, it’s really a shame that Laren’s sour attitude and lack of professionalism made our dining experience uncomfortable and subpar."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPl0b02dlIbOIgXLcQPnM_0BPk9NI9LzdhBP2nz\u0026fid=0x0:0x1e8568236be22147""],""When"":""2024-12-17""},{""Name"":""Thais Oliveira"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKXD1ghyGnpuIJs3_L2s_WmL-t8i8bpNdTnvYmAiDTd_aiIWg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This was the best dining experience I’ve ever had.

Otherwise, I will be talking about my experiences and will base my rating on the 3 categories (food, service, environment/atmosphere)\n\nWhen walking into the restaurant, it was very tight and compact. No more than 6-7 people can fit inside, hence the seats outside and behind the restaurant. Restaurant holds the 50s theme inside and uses an old milkshake mixing machine, which was a nice touch. No washroom available, so make sure you have something to clean your hands with.\n\nService was neutral, nothing much to talk about. We order, wait, get the food, and eat. Honestly, it doesn't make a memorable experience, but my expectations weren't high.\n\nThe food, however, impressed me. Thick cut grandma fries were alright, and some don't maintain crispness for a long period of time. The LA burger, on the other hand, was very nice. Housemade bun held all the ingredients together and did not crumble. The patty was nicely seasoned and had the grill char flavor. The mushrooms, bacon,cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes combined nicely offer a perfectly balanced burger. One tiny gripe I had was that my burger had more mustard than anticipated.\n\nWhen it came down to the milkshake, I was thoroughly impressed. Perfect balance of sweetness, and you can taste the ice cream, milk, and then the strawberry. Simply amazing!\n\nBefore I left, I decided to try the bulldog. It was alright, but bun held everything together but proved to be messy to consume. The amount of mustard added was again too much, and other than the sausage (which was nice and had a nice slight char smoky flavor and the casing pops) was all I tasted. I'm not too impressed with it compared to the burger.\n\nOverall, it's an impressive burger spot and definitely hits the spot if you are looking for a quality burger. Probably would recommend eating on an outside table, bringing your own hand wipes, and don't expect an amazing customer service from the establishment. Would definitely come back if im passing by Burnaby and craving a burger and milkshake.

Never going back tot his terrible restaurant."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN6ClNms4GJLWmantRvYVX7BQAqSW5FG6amsGZQ\u0026fid=0x0:0xdbb9c8827a53dea9""],""When"":""2024-4-23""}]",

Where shall I start? Ordered a three piece combo, for take out. and later when getting ready to eat, I opened the box and found only two pieces. Then, one of those two pieces was a half-drumstick - literally half of it was broken off! (In the photo is the bone of a whole drumstick - looks deformed!)When I went back to ask what they can do, she said I can only have a two piece. Basically, to compensate for me having to spend as much gas just to go back there I was not even breaking even. Then, to begin with,  I was told I could choose a fountain drink or bottled pop as part of my combo, so I chose the bottled pop. I noticed how we an Additonal charge of 50 cents on the till. The cashier did not say it was “extra” just that I could choose between the two. So, I said never mind then. I will have a fountain drink. Then she goes “oh, that’s out of order, have a bottled drink then. Hmmm, it was what I wanted after all but kinda makes you wonder about her saying “you can choose” between them. Why did I give two stars vs one? The one normal piece of chicken I actually ate, it was quite good.\n\nUpdate: Because this place is so convenient I went again, but yet again, I was disappointed. Similar to last time it was poor service and substandard chicken. The three pictures added is a view of the tough leathery surface of a chicken thigh underneath the crispy skin.  When I complained and showed the piece to the lady at the counter, she  said “but you ate most of it and then found out?”  Hmmm. So I peeled back more of the crispy skin to show her the full scope of the tough surface. Only then did she reluctantly give me a replacement piece. Not sure about how common this is, but never have I ever gotten chicken like this anywhere else - not Churches, not KFC, and certainly not Jollibee."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBYPI4xcDnG-LCCaS3ORoEnGsXJaRElj3bGDNG\u0026fid=0x0:0x1d3f24bc3ca4a38c""],""When"":""2022-8-7""},{""Name"":""Evangelina Y.

If this was the result of following regulations, then I wonder how other burger restaurants manage to serve juicy patties while adhering to the same rules.\n\nIn the end, the male manager waived the charge for the burger, but he offered no apology—just excuses. I have to ask: was this burger truly worth selling? Was it something to be proud of? This meal completely ruined my evening. In the 30 minutes we spent at the restaurant, the only thing I managed to eat was the truffle fries.\n\nThis was an incredibly disappointing experience. If this is the standard for the burgers and service at this establishment, I will not be returning to Bin4."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO9WW2pYrkwOp27gx0H9ltMpvx0Hz9Jqk3uH_af\u0026fid=0x0:0x37e0badfec615773""],""When"":""2024-12-20""},{""Name"":""mo mp"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU5PCaSpKxxaEFa5TlF8cw5g3dBgpV1qAn1IYhAD5HYr_z2gBw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Bin 4 Burger Lounge in Burnaby offers a gourmet burger experience that’s hard to beat.

Which is many hours later, and meant the world to me, since I love their food and would obviously be hungry after class. I have to say, I’ve had many interactions ordering food and calling restaurants, and this was definitely one of the best calls I’ve had. Quick, efficient, and effective! I did head over when my class finished, and they knew exactly what I had ordered! I mentioned mines probably the one that’s been sitting there for hours haha and I thought I’d be getting that, and honestly I would’ve been happy with that. But they knew my situation, and without a second thought they completely remade my order for me!

The smell of it stinked up our house of this gross burnt flavour. We could not eat the chicken and had to throw it out\n\n2. The chicken we ordered was original, but we received the spicy version (see picture which shows there is the spicy seasoning used in the chicken)\n\n3. The chicken skin was soggy\n\n4. We could not/ have not been able to get a hold of the restaurant. Before delivery we wanted to call to ensure our order was able to go through as when we saw the online review option it said the item we placed was unavailable. We also wanted to ask for napkins and ketchup/hot sauce. We called after receiving the order to also try to let the restaurant know about our awful tasting chicken. All 7 times we called they did not pick up.\n\nWhy have a phone number provided/ have a phone number if they won’t answer it? Not only did they have us terrible food, b hurt they also gave terrible service for an overall awful experience.

I have a couple of photos attached. These photos are showing expectation and reality. See if you can spot the difference. I purchased two Baconator Burger meals that came with fries and drinks. Unfortunately, we looked at the pictures that were displayed, and we both wanted baconators, and when we got them, we said that they can't be the same thing. You be the judge.\nAfter mentioning it to a basic manager, I asked her to bring me the store manager and she said she would and she never did. Upon leaving the store I managed to speak with the store manager or so she said add her comment was these are the old pictures. I said well this is what we saw and what we were expecting and certainly not what we got. For this kind of money I would have rather gone to A\u0026W and or Burger King and for a few dollars more I could go to White Spot and get a much better product with the ambiance. Be sure to respond to this and talk about it, Wendy's is not the only one but there's certainly one of the worst."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO5a08HG0vi97U2uGXdpHAlSiaR9M1ndZA9cwjf\u0026fid=0x0:0xf4ceb47c30b2e520""],""When"":""2024-6-17""},{""Name"":""Munchica"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbQ6ACs51IPQJlRLrmnunOErED8bimOf5-y1uov4EWpuZvjQQjrA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The new French onion triple cheeseburger is delicious.

The staff is always making improvements, so if your experience happens to not be 100%, you can rest assured that on your next visit it will be much improved.  For example they improved the freshness of their chips and salsa by refilling throughout the day instead of at the end of the day as it has a 24 hour shelf life only.\n\nTheir chips and tacos are also custom made and not off-the-shelf that you get at the grocery store.  Their taco shell appears to have less (or none?) preservatives than what you will find in a grocery store too.\n\nThey seem to play the long game at this location so improvements are always a theme and your experience goes from triple-A to five-star A's in no time.\n\nNote: Under \""which dishes do you recommend\"" there isn't an option for what I actually prefer to order, so please look at their menu to decide if you would like to eat here.  They have waaaay more options than what is listed under Google.\n\nWhat is neat about the Kingsway, Burnaby location is as of the time of this writing they open till 4am Wednesdays to Sundays.\n\nSo it is great for those with hectic schedules and need to grab a bite to eat.  Some days can get crazy busy for me and before I know it I look up at the clock and everywhere is closed, but luckily this Quesada is opened late for the majority of the week and because they have a nice variety of vegetables in a low carb taco, it matches my overall diet and supports my weekly anaerobic and aerobic training. I train in the 6:30 to 7:00 minute mile pace 3 to 4 days straight then 1 day off then repeat and I know when a certain food takes away my strength, power and endurance.  Their a la cart tacos helps to support my year round training."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Michael X1"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLDknbSOU7cCHAxgCADDoNzqRfASOWZwBKih-RAjP8rc4RgdQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""Don't order the 14\"" Beef Burrito, just order the 10\"" it's like they don't understand that if you order a bigger size you need to put more in it.

Here’s a rundown of what I experienced:\n\nThe first dish was a beautifully presented plate of clams paired with slices of sponge gourd, all nestled in a light, flavorful broth. The clams were fresh, and the subtle sweetness of the sponge gourd complemented them perfectly. The lightness of this dish made it a refreshing starter, ideal for those who enjoy delicate flavors.\n\nI also had clams in black bean sauce. This dish had a rich, savory profile with a slight hint of heat. The black bean sauce was robust, yet it didn't overpower the natural taste of the clams. Topped with fresh green onions, this dish was a delightful contrast to the lighter first course.\n\nFinally, I tried their beef noodle soup with pickled greens, I think it was A2. The broth was deeply flavorful, likely from hours of simmering, and had a wonderful depth that was both comforting and satisfying. The addition of pickled greens brought a tangy, slightly spicy element to the dish, balancing out the richness of the beef and broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the beef was tender, making each spoonful a perfect bite.\n\nThe service at No. 1 Noodle House was equally impressive. Stone, Lucy, and Lily were attentive, friendly, and made sure that every aspect of the dining experience was seamless. Their recommendations were spot-on, and they truly went out of their way to ensure we had a great meal. It’s clear that they take pride in their work, which added a personal touch to our visit.\n\nNo. 1 Beef Noodle offers a great selection of well-prepared dishes that cater to a variety of tastes. Whether you’re in the mood for something light and refreshing or rich and savory, there’s something here for everyone. The food presentation is also noteworthy, with each dish arriving at the table looking as good as it tastes. Combined with the excellent service from Stone, Lucy, and Lily, I highly recommend giving this place a try if you’re in the area and craving some quality Asian cuisine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQ_QiwvhZe0gBoNEfgehVEjSmDfO-mTYXGzvOs\u0026fid=0x0:0x6a548458c192f1e6""],""When"":""2024-8-10""}]",

People who don't like food service shouldn't be hired so their business will not get affected with bad server attitudes.\n\nI will be adding 1 star since customer service has upgraded, they have respected the social distancing and made extra precautions, the business has outdoor seating, and the food tastes a bit better than before.\n\n--\nMarch 15, 2020\nfood is not dry anymore. me and my husband come here more than the landmark. the veggies might be over fried cz it just sits there after 1pm.

was my first time experiencing this style of hot pot, and it was quite unique. You start by selecting your ingredients from an extensive array of options, including sliced meats, processed meatballs, noodles, fresh vegetables, and more.

Next, you select a broth, and the restaurant cooks everything together before serving it to you.\n\nWhile it takes away the interactive fun of cooking it yourself, the end result is undeniably delicious, even if it looks like a big bowl of slop. It's a different approach to hot pot, but one that’s worth trying for the flavour alone.

However, it’s easy to get carried away!\n\nWe ended up selecting a bit more than we anticipated, resulting in a bill of around $100 for two hotpots and a bubble tea. On the other hand, my friends, who were a bit more restrained, managed to keep their meals under $20, with some people even spending under $10. The broth base we chose was the Signature Ma La Tang, which added a nice kick to the hotpot.\n\nOne of the highlights was the complimentary black tea-flavored ice cream they served at the end of the meal—a pleasant and refreshing way to wrap things up.

It wasn't too busy and we were able to put in an order without waiting at all. A quick scan of the menu makes you think about other deep-fried chicken outlets like Church's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Popeye's Chicken. We ordered a chicken sandwich and a 10-piece order of regular (not spicy) fried chicken wings, with a Family/Large order of French fries. The service staff was friendly and courteous, and the food came out in a few minutes after we placed the order. We carried away instead of eating in the restaurant because we were trying to get back to the nearby Hilton hotel, but we would have ate the food there, given there were several tables and chairs inside the restaurant (they also have tables and chairs outside on a small patio, if the weather was nicer/warmer). All in all a decent service of deep-fried goodness, but the chicken wings seemed a bit pricey ($18-plus for an order of 10 wings that weren't really that big). Nowhere to park your car except along Kingsway (if that's possible) or one of the side/cross streets."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMTQPb0F6Z6USIK75qpOJtj_9I3hehlP2fCZcgi\u0026fid=0x0:0xd844dd14ce21ca3c""],""When"":""2024-3-2""},{""Name"":""Reda Escaros"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUJ6JK_AzWcA5IOpU4A1k3FXEyBtcc9oS5vU3PaE4gVhERm-ZYh=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Excellent food quality and taste,  service is fast and efficient, the place is clean and tidy, nice patio with lot of space,  good dessert menu,  friendly staff,  convenient location close to skytrain and bus stops, parking at the strip mall next door is free"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMxUu4JCP294YRDyssKYO0B0_NEr3q9u1PA-Vfk\u0026fid=0x0:0xd844dd14ce21ca3c""],""When"":""2024-9-18""},{""Name"":""Jasmine Hue"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKqkEG8hdpj1GWbUCRuCfqshr_1LIMOmkiCQxVcwwWQuNuLbw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Our first time trying with friends.

My feelings for the one star downgrade from the initial 5 stars was cemented from my past visit this weekend.\n\nFirst off, the chicken pieces have become smaller, as you can see from pictures below from 3 years ago, even 12 pieces were hard to fit inside one box, now you can fit 16 pieces in one box and there’s still room.\n\nAlso they’ve increased their price from the initial $50 for a 16 piece family meal, to now $70 for the same meal. I don’t mind the price increase, but combined with the smaller portion, it’s inflation plus shrinklation. Which is unacceptable.\n\nNext off, the quality of the food. There were burnt pieces on the chicken, as well as some soggy parts. I truly don’t understand how that’s possible. The fries were lukewarm at best and becomes cold by the time you get home (a 10 minute drive for us). There were also burnt bits on many fries, as well as overcooked dried up fries mixed in.\n\nThe service was fine though, we got our order and was served pretty promptly. But they now charge $0.25 for a paper bag even though this location is in Burnaby and not in Vancouver. I understand restaurants that charge the fee because of the by law from the city of Vancouver, but I’ve also noticed other restaurants that are outside of Vancouver copying the same thing. To me, that’s just plain greed for charging what used to be the cost of business. Much like the box, or the napkins or the straws. You don’t start nickel and dimming your customers, it’s just bad business practice and shows me profit is your main objective and the customer experience is not important.\n\nNeedless to say, I won’t be visiting this location of church’s anymore, which is a true pity.\n\nOriginal review from 2021:\n\nMy favourite fried chicken chain restaurant will have to go to Church’s. This location is always busy, and they’re open 24-7.\n\nService is always speedy here, even though they don’t have that many staff behind the counter. I always go for their family combos and enjoy having left overs for lunches the next day.\n\nChurch’s big pieces of chicken and gives you thighs by default. Their chicken is always crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. I think their key is brining. Unlike KFC some pieces are tiny and the crust is soggy by the time you get home. KFC also uses lots of MSG in their seasoning which makes you super thirsty afterwards.\n\nTheir sides are decent, but I don’t like their biscuits. It’s usually dry and hard. Otherwise their potato salad and macaroni salad is on point. The fries can be a hit and miss at times. Depends when they came out the fryer. Sometimes I pop them into the toaster over for awhile when I get home if they get cold and soggy on the way back.\n\nI’ve been to this location many times now, and I can’t recall a bad experience so far. From time to time they also do special promotions out on their windows too."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPt7ZyK26Fqbj6mw0f8xhsC0ErY2Yjy2d8XI41G\u0026fid=0x0:0x6a1d87799bbe8d6e""],""When"":""2021-6-1""},{""Name"":""JayVanCitLife"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUyAsdhrRr255MPrce1_YiiQwAOZbCMDqAqNn3u59N6sirq26U=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""It’s been a decade or two since I visited a Church’s Chicken.

Subway location ok Canada Way and my overall experience left me quite disappointed, resulting in a rating of just two stars. While the cleanliness of the restaurant was acceptable, the quality of the food fell far below my expectations. The service, on the other hand, was just satisfactory.\n\nMy biggest concern centered around the food itself, particularly the tomatoes and lettuce. The tomatoes, to my dismay, appeared distressingly old and unappetizing. Seeking a fresher alternative, I politely requested the sandwich maker to provide me with tomatoes from the middle rather than the ends. To my surprise, her response was an outright refusal, leaving me quite surprised..\n\nIn light of this experience, I believe that this particular Subway location could greatly benefit from improvements in their food quality. They definitely use ‘yesterdays’ food.  It is disheartening to encounter such lackluster ingredients, especially when fresh produce is a vital component of a satisfying #SUBWAY sandwich. I believe thats because franchise owner isn't willing to ‘’throw away’’ old food. I sincerely hope that they take customer feedback seriously and strive to enhance their offerings."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPKILvMmnyxXmJuEryT4XHE8a7OIIGTAMZBs4BY\u0026fid=0x0:0xe297887e4f3c9a47""],""When"":""2024-4-23""},{""Name"":""Jeremy Nguyen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWwZnv6XBC6J9pwIa9xaO_L8M72gjenL1nD3ufdSrddJzNo1BKq=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Subway isn't just about food—it's a journey of flavor and freshness.

My parents are so lucky to have such a nice place to go every morning. Skylights and giant floor to ceiling two story windows, and a great place to meet your neighbours and go for a walk.\n\nIt is going to be a terrible blow to the community when they destroy this mall to make way for residential towers and force people to the streets. This is the best place in all kinds of weather for seniors and everyone else to walk in a safe and climate stable environment.

At these A\u0026W Brew Bars, you can get a variety of frozen beverages, including special blends of frozen root beer drinks that aren't offered at regular A\u0026W stores.\n\nWe decided to pay a visit to our nearest A\u0026W Brew Bar and see what the hype was about. The cups get filled at this special dispenser where you can see on the screen, what percentage of the cup has been filled. This was kind of fun to watch.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nFrozen A\u0026W Root Beer\nA\u0026W Root Beer Sweet Cream Shake\nA\u0026W Root Beer Mocha Shake\n\nThere's no denying that A\u0026W makes very good root beer, so any kind of beverage with their root beer in it is bound to be tasty. All 3 of our drinks were yummy; the Root Beer Mocha Shake was the most unique.\n\nWhile the drinks were tasty, it really felt like an overrated experience that really didn't merit the price tag attached to it. These were basically glorified Slushy drinks. Again, nothing wrong with the drinks. They were all tasty. But to us...considering how much they charged for the drinks, it didn't seem like very good value to us. There are many other places we'd prefer to go to for a slushy drink than A\u0026W Brew Bar.

Well not in this case.  The smallest amount I have ever seen given at a subway. Multiple times we had to say we wanted more. Definitely won't be going back to this subway for a long time.

Only 2 tables open for dine-in, but feel free to order take-out or delivery.\n\nMy order:\n\n-Japanese Style Cheesesteak: my personal favourite - juicy sautéed mushrooms \u0026 onions, aged cheddar, wasabi mayo and of course premium ribeye steak slices. It’s saucy, and the cheese blend enhances the flavour.\n-Koagie (Korean Hoagie): Kimchi was good (not too sour or spicy), so I could comfortably eat it.\n-New Yorker: the classic if you don't want to venture away from a\n\""normal Philly cheesesteak\"" - topped with fresh tomatoes and lettuce\n\nOverall, the hoagie roll was soft on the inside, and a good chewy texture on the outside. I reheated mines in the microwave, and it still tasted good several hours later. These cheeseteaks are more saucy than the traditional cheesesteaks, which I personally enjoyed as every bite was filled with flavour. Very filling - best to share if you want to try different flavours. I also really liked their assortment of cheeses (no fake Cheez-Whiz stuff, sorry if you like that though), I think they use aged cheddar, provolone, and some others in a cheese blend. They definitely don't cheap out, and use a generous portion of tender/sliced prime rib steak. All cheesesteaks are made-to-order on a grill when you place your order.\n\n-Onion Rings: skinny-style\n-Deep Fried Pickles: good thick cut of pickles to breading ratio\n-ACC Fries (Garlic Butter \u0026 Parmesan): classic thick cut fries with a very \""potato-y\"" flavour\n-White Chocolate Blueberry Milkshake: quite sweet, definitely for people that have a sweet tooth\n\nAlso, I definitely have to mention the house-made sauces, they're so good for dipping the onion rings, pickles, and fries (cheesesteaks were saucy enough, so I didn't need it there). My personal favourites were the roasted garlic aioli, smoke Chipotle BBQ (not to overpowering or salty), and mustard (real mustard seeds)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPy4x4SxlJVE85YyYd_JGDKxnrGdZkXh6kVcPFk\u0026fid=0x0:0xac3531c6b4a6f4ed""],""When"":""2021-3-11""},{""Name"":""Dimitri Pelosof"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIfM58KLNF27k8gTDOAVxOk2C6YwnGFyNuoc3mVfuH_B24uvA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Big shot was so amazing the staff member truffle aioli sauce is bomb would definitely come back again best cheesesteak I ever had."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPOB1N550TcmKkU4hbjaA_E1bPslT_EyeIYt90u\u0026fid=0x0:0xac3531c6b4a6f4ed""],""When"":""2024-8-3""},{""Name"":""tarneema propa"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXwd9dHiU9egWWKWk0jQDOep6xbwkVQ_SHmBqvP7L114SCcbxlJ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Recently the poutine which I always order from here is  not up to the standard.

I liked them all (Korean Hoagie, Lobster Shrimp, Japanese Style), but my favourite was the Japanese Style. It had a great umami flavour.\n\nBoth that one and the Koagie had plenty of filling, the seafood had significantly less (but I expected that) - good dill flavour, though. I'd skip the sides, but will definitely be back for the innovative cheesesteaks!\n\nEdit: After seeing the company's Instagram story and other photos, I realize that they were running a free caviar promotion on the lobster shrimp melt. The staff forgot to give it for our order (which was done directly at the shop) so that was unfortunate.

Someone needs to lead a better example so all others can follow how could they, and how should they. Plus they're always so chincy with the toppings here! Get urself a Safeway sandwich instead.

Returned to this location. Ripped bread. Slaps on meat unevenly. Like my end doesn't have meat. Can u please cover evenly ... your given enough meat. Just no care. That goes with cheese. After toasting. We get to veggies. Same thing. So I politely asked could I get more lettuce at the end pieces of my sandwich and explained to her to try to spread out evenly. Tomatoes I also reminded and reiterated. Then same goes with all my other toppings. No care. No love. No customer service. Holdom is only a bit off down the road. It's the one I've been going too.

Lemme tell ya, the prices weren’t like they use to be that’s for sure.\n\nIt was 2:30am in the morning and I had a hankering for ice cream. I didn’t know this location was open till 5am! So I went for a drive. I never tried the strawberry cheesecake blizzard before, ever. It’s definitely my new blizzard favourite now. Generous chunks of cheese cakes. Mixed with chunks of strawberries and syrup. Man… it really hit the spot. I’m usually a Oreo or chocolate guy but this one really impressed me. Thank you for the cool treat! I wish I took a better picture but it was so good I gobbled it up so quickly!\n\nAs for service I mean… what do you expect. It’s graveyard. There were 2 guys hustling away stocking and cleaning. One guy at the cashier had a negative tone taking my order. He probably had a check list of duties going on from his boss. Or perhaps he has another job or problems at home. Second guy made the blizzard. I was wondering while he was making it if he was going to hand it to me upside down, like I always did when I was a teen.

Every one of my experiences, minus 1, has been great.\n\nThe one that wasn't so great was a mixup in my order request I made on the app for pickup. Specifically, the special instructions I added weren't followed, when on past orders they have been. I asked for mashed potatoes as my 2 large sides instead of the salads. For some reason their website, app and drive through menu don't list mashed potatoes as an option, even though they have them. Also, I upgraded my 2 fries to mega individual for an additional $1 total. I also asked for thigh only dark meat for the chicken. These 3 requests weren't met. I didn't check everything until I got home because the drive through was busy and it would have been a hassle opening all those containers in my car.\n\nI provided feedback through the app. The next day I got a call from the store manager. She apologized and offered me 6 pieces of chicken, 2 large mashed potatoes and 1 large gravy as a resolution and acceptance of responsibility. I honestly wasn't expecting I would ever hear back at all. For this generous offer and the apology, which I accepted graciously, I give HUGE props to this store and manager for correcting and maintaining a positive customer relationship.\n\nThen today I get a letter from KFC corporate apologizing and including a $10 coupon toward any purchase. Again, I didn't ask for our expect this! Well done again!\n\nAlso, at the drive through the workers wear masks, use hand sanitizer frequently and will substitute drinks for gravy without hassle of charge.\n\nThe food is enjoyable; the chicken tastes fresh, moist and has that yummy 11 herbs and spices goodness! It's why I keep coming back to KFC. I'll keep coming back to this KFC because of the impeccable customer service!\n\nPS - there are really good coupons on their website that are customizable.\n\nPSS - their strawberry cheesecake is awesome!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNPbku4v19jb512LPUXFo9RnmlFgTZuC3vqAHHp\u0026fid=0x0:0xdecded6c05c2ef19""],""When"":""2020-9-10""},{""Name"":""Steve Wright"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIChg-sTXbvynXfOtQrXVIlLUNM015FBRILxInncYq16DD__w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Every time I order from here they gives you chicken soaking wet in grease.

She placed them on the table and this was the result.  we lost them in the end.  Report the complaint to the manager on Friday afternoon, exactly at 8:10 p.m.  She is a girl from the East.  She told me that he was required to receive the entire order at the time he received the burgers.  I didn't agree.  I think that in this restaurant this female manager lacks a lot of empathy and Christian values ​​of respect, consideration and kindness.  I hope this complaint gets where it needs to go.

Since no spots were empty I decided to park and eat inside instead.\n\nWhile I sat and ate next to the parking stalls I saw what was happening… totally not fair.

We ate inside the tables were gross, but once again McDonald's....what do you really expect here? Lots of parking as we came in late.

I waited and asked the manager or possibly supervisor, and got the same response. I had to wait in line again while my food was getting cold. I was disappointed that I had to pay for extra McChicken sauce. The approach could have been a lot better. For example, they could have said, \""Sorry sir, we charge for McChicken sauce at this location. In the future, please pay at the till, but here is your McChicken sauce for today. Sorry about that.\""\n\nOR POST AT THE TILL WE CHARGE FOR EXTRA CONDIMENTS??? CHEAP FRANCHISEE...\n\nWhen I tried to get a Coke, both Coke machines were broken.

I've been waiting for almost five months since I first saw their signs, and it officially opened about a week ago. It's located inside the Lelem Village, which is great because there's a nice outdoor space where you can sit and enjoy the summer. There are also outdoor games available there.\n\nThe staff are nice and kind—I asked for additional sauce, and they happily gave it to me, so I'm giving them a 10/10 😛. The quality of the food is the same as at all other Popeyes locations: it's nice and tasty, perfect if you enjoy fast food. Everything is orderly and clean, and you can order ahead using the app and pick it up when you get there.\n\nI definitely recommend their hot wings and butterfly shrimp; both were really nice and tasty. Try all the different sauces—personally, I prefer the buttermilk ranch, but I also like the Cajun cocktail sauce, which is pretty unique to me.\n\nI'll definitely try more and update my review if anything changes. 🍤 🍗 🍟\n\n[Update, 2024, September]\nIt's been a while since I posted another review, but everything is still just as good. They’re now available on their website, and you can order ahead. The rewards in the app could be improved—they don’t quite match up to others, but still better than nothing. This time, I ordered the classic chicken burger along with fried onions and mashed potatoes. The onions are on another level—I really love them. The mashed potatoes are a bit spicy but still tasty. As for the burger, I personally prefer it with a bit of ranch, but honestly, with or without, it's still delicious. The staff are amazing as always, and overall, it's still a 5/5 experience. 🍗 🧅"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPBd9guMOXCE60RDnZXy9Hvbx18VQHuJpMdUBTO\u0026fid=0x0:0x7118c4a8819bcd18""],""When"":""2024-7-19""},{""Name"":""Kamalnoor Singh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK1TIHNOXScihCYhT1oo2KAGBU-6wfqxhlW7bvXUQrGKX2MvQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The quality of chicken was really good.

Recently, I noticed a small sliver of a storefront open up on Edmonds Street in Burnaby. The thing that caught my eye was that there wasn’t a door to get into the place! As it turns out, the shop’s entrance is actually located in the back parking lot… talk about a hole-in-the-wall!\n\nYour best bet is to put your order in via their app as it takes a while for your chicken to be prepped. I opted for their Half and Half ($24) with a mix of their original and soy garlic chicken (my order also came with pickled radish and a can of pop). In all honesty, both versions were similar in flavour. The good thing is that they know how to make chicken. The outside had a nice crisp to it while the meat on the inside was tender and juicy.\n\nThe following week, I decided to try their Padak Padak ($14 for half order) which is their sweet soy-mustard sauce chicken topped off with green onions curls and added a side of their Shake Shake Fries ($3) with cheese seasoning. I’m sure some people like the cheese seasoning on their fries but it didn’t do too much for me.\n\nOn the good side, the chicken is just as tender and juicy on the inside as on my last visit. However, there’s not much variety here in terms of flavour. Overall, if you like crispy Korean fried chicken that’s tender on the inside, you’ll probably like this place.

My Order number was 284 $27.24.\n\n1) I had part of my order to go and the other part to dine in . The cashier asks me do you need a paper bag for the To Go order . Is this even a question ? How is any customer to carry the half covered fries and the burgher box that’s half opened outside ? Even if you’re going in your own vehicle ? Let alone people taking the bus / cycle , scooter etc . Then the despatching girl asks me do you need napkins ? Really ? I had to ask for ketch up !! When these food chains were run by the original people in North America service was priority . They never asked these impractical questions !! Most of the food chains are now bought over by people whose main concern is not service but scrounge on every penny they can save . After waiting for over 25 minutes I finally got my order and the fries were old ones and the salad leaves were just crushed they were almost blackened.The server never apologized for the order being delayed . They could not be careless !! At the kitchen they chit chat and they were in their own worlds !! Not customer centric at all and no passion in what they do !!\n\n2 ) Humanity aspect - The portion that I dines I went upstairs . There’s was a gentleman who was dining and he was not well and he suddenly dropped on the floor . I went down and informed the kitchen staff that a customer had just fallen on the floor . They just looked at the camera and could not care less and went on about their work . I went back up and checked and the man was still on the ground no response . No one came up . I went back again to the kitchen and informed the staff that he is still not responding. To which one girl in the staff said oh we just called the security!!\n\nI was so disappointed at how very callous and inhumane response of the entire team !! Security ? They should call 911 !! It could be a life and death situation for that person ?\n\nThis brings to the question what type of business ethics does MacDonalds operate ? Don’t they value humans ? What’s the point of collecting money for Ronald McDonald hospitals if the organization does not foster a humane culture with ethics in their staff ???\n\nVery disappointing of the Brand and the type of staff you employ ."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mariena Bui"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU6Nw1jeBXne8haJacgZytBHrMEqU2gmOMAF3l5QWK0CwO3rXPJ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I ordered a smoothie and fries and I had a great experience as they were both nice and fresh"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOIyjmeB0ZTcBbP5O9IkIEj10zlEVOTuIerY3Gt\u0026fid=0x0:0xeba8183922aa5fba""],""When"":""2024-9-12""},{""Name"":""Özge DOĞAN"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXGoS7H4h6WX2AItQ57BUUk9fSiOEugT2AI-ymBl-Yuc2zUoRml=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""As an employee, would you put this lettuce in the sandwich you made for yourself?

You start feeling the spice the longer you eat it and all the components add in multiple different textures. (Crunchy fried outside , fluffy buns, soft, spiced mashed potatoe Vada).\nWith that said, it can get heavy after a while.

this McDonald’s for the first time, Unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant. The day I decided to finally try it, there was a long line of six people waiting to order. I understand that demand is always high at McDonald’s, so I was prepared to wait my turn and then wait again for my food.\n\nHowever, the wait turned out to be much longer than I expected. I noticed there were only two employees—one handling orders and food preparation, while the other seemed busy with some sort of inventory task. We politely asked a couple of times if the wait would be much longer, and each time, the employee responded with a slightly irritated attitude, saying it wouldn’t be too long. I understood they were likely under pressure, so I waited patiently. Almost 40 minutes later, I finally received my order, which turned out to be incorrect. At that point, though, I was too hungry to complain, so I decided to accept it as it was.\n\nI sat down with my partner, poured my drink, and was just about to take a bite of my burger when the same employee came over and told us they were closing, and we had to leave. I asked if we could just have a few minutes to finish our food while they cleaned up or closed out their registers. She bluntly told me no. Frustrated, hungry, and after spending over an hour just to get a burger, I ended up eating my food standing outside on the street.\n\nAnother customer in a similar situation agreed with me, saying they should have informed us before ordering that dining in would not be allowed. It would’ve been reasonable to at least let us finish eating inside for a few minutes while they wrapped up their tasks.\n\nIn all honesty, I can’t understand why they couldn’t give us even 10 extra minutes to finish our meals in the dining area before closing."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""SUNGSHIN LEE"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXTHEUJEH0mZSgA5db_QMPnswjUhhpjoXIbFsCVYlhI913rxbiN=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Indian girl with make ups at cashier has attitude and gets orders wrong.\n\nMy mcchicken burger bread was torn off in the edge and it had spicy sauce on it when i ordered just regular one.\n\nI ordered 2 double qt pounder w cheese and mcchicken instead got 2 mcchicken.

absolutely delicious.  My favourite items on the menu are the Northern Pho with fatty flank and the Stir Fried Lemon-Grass Beef on Vermicelli (10 out of 10). Highly recommend both and I have ate everywhere including Pho Duy, Cafe Dang Anh, Linh Cafe, and Hoang Yen.\n\nI am from Hanoi and this dish reminds me of Bun Bo Nam Bo.  IYKYK.\n\n(My only issue is their Spring Rolls, they use egg wrappers and the inside is like a Chinese egg roll.)\n\nI prefer the ones at Cafe Dang Anh, with use of thin rice papers.\n\nBut the star ⭐️ is the service.  The attention to detail and care of the ingredients and presentation.\n\nI have ordered the last 3 nights in a row and everything was packed so neatly and portioned out nicely.   They really care and deserve recognition."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOhN5GVhVEg-pfvPDU3ldmdvlXCF-zMk0Kjvv0\u0026fid=0x0:0xa22d891ed787d7bd""],""When"":""2024-6-29""},{""Name"":""Lister Chen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVWbNvO55wOzkDRxCcJ-fMoCcdWyut5hlx-H_zUreRnwso9_V0=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Fav Vietnamese restaurant in south Burnaby.

I understand that special occasions like New Year's Day may present operational challenges, but consistency in food quality remains paramount.\n\nRegrettably, I'm inclined to withhold future visits for the time being.

around 5 pm and was deeply disappointed with the quality of the food. While the rice was cooked perfectly, the chicken I was served was not only old but also overcooked to the point of being dry and tough. It lacked moisture, making it nearly inedible, and the flavor was bland, indicating that the chicken had been sitting out for a while before it was served. A restaurant should prioritize fresh ingredients and proper cooking techniques, but unfortunately, this meal failed on both counts.

We were sat at a higher table with barstool seats, which were hard to move (as they don't glide on the flooring). Being middle-aged, some in the group needed help from others to be \""pushed\"" closer to the table. The food was good. I had the Crispy Cauliflower and Crispy Yam \u0026 Avocado Roll (which was average for the $11 price). The cauliflower had a nice breading and was flavourful, and felt like a slightly smaller portion (\""social hour\"" portion).\n\nWe had some concerns with the lack of service. We constantly had to flag down our waitress as we wanted to place part of our order before 6 pm to take advantage of the social hour pricing. My glass of water never was refilled during the meal. For a large group, it would have been nice to get checked in on from time-to-time, as a courtesy. Because of our group size, we still had to pay the automatic 18% gratuity, but we didn't think the service warranted that amount. The food itself did come out in a timely manner and was done correctly with some diners' special requests. When asked, our server was able to take a group photo of our table.\n\nAmple parking in the parkade below with a 3-hour limit, which I was told was a non-factor after 6 pm when I called the restaurant ahead of time. Overall, we had an average experience! While the food was decent, the service for our larger group left a bit to be desired (3 stars)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMRMdbceD5gvubL_XIV_xZyV73uBO4uvNPN8nFX\u0026fid=0x0:0x1f96fae1d97e6d13""],""When"":""2024-8-30""},{""Name"":""Chris Yeung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUcT6Z40EZW4C3yt0N7VoX3tM1V1mzzAe7xxRrgBiMmtInx7b7I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went to Brown's Socialhouse Brentwood to celebrate a friend's birthday.

It's suggested you make reservations because this Earl's gets very busy. It has a dining area inside and a lounge area plus an outside patio. Inside is nicely decorated with a lot of hanging plants and retro lighting and seating. Its very clean inside.  We were sat down quickly, and our waitress greeted us right away. Lucky for us, Earl's serves a brunch menu till 2 pm, so that's what we ordered. My wife had the egg breakfast while my wife's friend and I had the crab cake benny. All of our food tasted great.

I paid $16.99, as their menu described, so I just can't figure it out. Did only this location raise the price? Either way, they need to update the menu. I might be overreacting, but I kind of felt scammed.\n\nI visited this location around 9PM, but there was no one at the front, so I waited for a while. When no one came, I called the store, but no one answered. After waiting a bit longer, a server finally appeared and took my takeout order. I was told it would take 10-20 minutes to prepare my food. I got my order after about 20 minutes, which was fine.\nThe store didn’t seem busy, so I think they may be understaffed. Prices are the same as on third-party platforms, so I think it's more convenient to just order through them.\n\nLastly, I usually go to the downtown location, and I really enjoy the taste, the crispy tempura, and the delicious sauce there so .. 2stars for the Brentwood lolation but I'd give the downtown location 5 stars."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMbbZ3e6bXK0XGg2HyShtChf8BPjdBw-AxT6yNW\u0026fid=0x0:0xee3e26a6ee0d36cd""],""When"":""2024-12-22""},{""Name"":""Nikki Sy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBjATsJMmB41G9yqWFoEPo05_lPP8oOi4rOJgcyxBVDlQkbFzp=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""My husband and i ordered deluxe omelette curry and beef curry.

The staff were unhelpful and defensive when I gave them feedback, insisting they always cook fresh food, even though I showed them the disgusting chicken.\n\nWhen I asked for a replacement, the staff said it would take 30 minutes, then changed to 20 minutes, and finally said 13 minutes after checking the oven. Clearly, they don’t care about providing good customer service. They refused to give me a refund, and I had no choice but to accept two drumsticks instead of the thigh I originally ordered.\n\nIf you buy chicken from this place, be cautious. If it looks red like in the picture, do not buy it—demand a replacement. If it’s soft like the drumstick, then it’s safe to buy. This was a very bad experience, and it’s unfortunate because it’s my second time dealing with this. Last time, I arrived at the store to complain, but it was already closed.

The poke itself was good, as diners have the ability to choose from a variety of toppings (no limit for the \""regular\"" toppings). The amount of vegetables included is fair, and the bowls overall were solid. Standard toppings like imitation crab, wakame, pineapple, edamame, and a variety of onions. The most unique complimentary topping was pickled radish. I did appreciate that you could get plain fish if you didn't want a pre-marinated option.\n\nWe had a service issue which caused us to be at the store for much longer than expected. It became clear early on we were being helped by a new staff member. They had to re-do my bowl after I asked for their gluten-friendly Ponzu sauce option, and they initially used the regular sauce on the side. They were unsure if it was gluten-friendly or not, but used it anyways until it came to light later when they consulted with another employee. We also had to repeat multiple times that we wanted all the complimentary toppings aside from the ginger. In the bowl re-do, I watched the staffer almost include ginger so had to step in vocally as a reminder.\n\nFor one of our bowls, we asked if they could include a bit more fish, as it didn't look like a full scoop. Earlier, a more experienced female staffer told us that the fish they use is fresh and they don't always leave them out in the open. They indicated that if we ordered the non-spicy fish, they would get it fresh for our bowls (likely from the back). Yet, the staffer helping us was essentially scraping the nearly empty bins for fish and therefore, their one scoop wasn't really a \""full\"" scoop. When watching the other employees prepare bowls for others, we noticed they were more generous with their protein scoops. While the employee did apologize a couple of times for the bowl re-do, it was awkward for us as we didn't want to feel like we had to watch them prepare it, but it ended up being kind of necessary. There was also a lack of urgency because at that point, two other employees were building bowls for new customers. Someone, perhaps the store manager, did step in at one point to inform us of the toppings which were gluten-friendly (or not).\n\nOur first Steve's Poke Bar experience was an alright one! The fruit tea was delicious, and the poke itself was good. The service was not as positive due to the mishaps, but we'll probably be back as the regular prices are affordable. We also signed up for their rewards program using our phone number, although we weren't quite sure what it entails when we provided our number."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOdZR7GIBP6txxQK4KAObuh22ntSLRMKcGBqJIE\u0026fid=0x0:0xd578361c2fe014e2""],""When"":""2024-4-1""},{""Name"":""Dina H"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIfsq97R4sgDIOe7gesF05bhBwqVTm4mfLDvrvgUPwpnj6y7A=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Good portions.

The nearby vendor had a long line, a telltale sign of popularity, and I now understand why. In contrast, I chose the less crowded option, thinking the higher price and lack of a line might indicate better quality or faster service. Unfortunately, I was sorely mistaken.\n\n### Pricing Concerns\n\nThe first red flag was the price. The lunch box I ordered cost $18, a full $2 more expensive than similar offerings from the adjacent vendor. For a food court setting, this is quite steep. One would expect that such a price difference would be justified by superior food quality or portion size, but this was not the case.\n\n### Disappointing Food Quality\n\nThe food itself was a major letdown. Despite the higher cost, the quality was subpar. The beef brisket in my dish was particularly problematic. It was clear that the chef had not properly prepared it, as the meat had two distinct colors, indicating it had been cooked separately and perhaps inconsistently. This lack of attention to detail is unacceptable, especially when the cost is already higher than average.\n\n### Beverage and Dessert Woes\n\nThe milk tea, a staple in Hong Kong style fast food, was also disappointing. It had a slightly sour taste, suggesting it was not fresh. This is particularly surprising and disheartening considering it was off lunch time when the tea should have been recently brewed. The dessert, which I had hoped would redeem the meal, was an even bigger letdown. After just one sip, I decided it wasn't worth consuming. It seemed like a poor attempt to bulk up the meal to justify the high price, but it failed miserably in quality.\n\n### Overall Experience\n\nThe overall experience was very disappointing. The higher price was not justified by the quality of the food or the dining experience. It felt like a blatant attempt to charge more without offering anything extra in return. Given the poor quality of the meal, I found it hard to understand the business strategy behind such pricing.\n\n### A Second Chance\n\nDespite this negative experience, I intend to give this vendor one more chance. Sometimes, restaurants have off days, and I believe in giving second chances. However, if the quality does not improve, it will definitely be my last visit. I hope the next experience will be better and that the vendor will live up to the expectations set by their pricing.\n\nIn conclusion, a visit to this Hong Kong style fast food vendor at Crystal Mall was far from satisfactory. Overpricing, poor food quality, and disappointing beverages and desserts all contributed to a regrettable dining experience. Here’s hoping that the next visit proves to be a redemption."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP5vHbOgCpjv77d1K6PjixqNMg2jqa4l0QSq3j6\u0026fid=0x0:0x4a9b11486a79e64a""],""When"":""2024-5-20""},{""Name"":""Anne Lore"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVrUoJa9WyIOEqFyo55SuUiJv6i3qv3PIOgCQYpFht8mdTbsqvf1A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""This used to be my go-to spot at Crystal Mall for its variety, but the quality has dropped.

Called back the restaurant and inquired if they revised the recipe and/or just missing the sauce (comparing to picture shown)?? The staff responded they are certain there is sauce but if still unsatisfied we can pick-up a \""free sauce for our next visit\"" as a solution for missing in this order. Phone was placed on table while inquiring with packaging/kitchen staff that handled the order. Loud strong vocals in Mandarin argumentatively of certainty in preparation and in no way for error..fighting back with FOH staff via convo on phone. Few months earlier, this same situation occured WITHOUT sauce - and when contacted via app, uber just thanks you for your feedback regarding missing sauce (no refund), and left unable to enjoy the dish properly. This is the second time. This is the 2/2 orders we made for this dish and we find this troublesome, time consuming and distressing over a simple dish.\n\nAt the end, drove all the way back to Bubble World Burnaby and they gave a replacement, while showing them the order made incorrectly.\n\nThey suggested for next time to ask uber for full refund on entire uber based on this one dish error.

My hunger was ferocious, and the enticing aromas of sizzling teriyaki lured me into the siren’s trap that is Koya Japan. Little did I know I was about to embark on a culinary nightmare so profound, Gordon Ramsay himself would weep.\n\nThe line moved slower than a glacier, as though each customer before me was hand-forging their teriyaki dreams from scratch. At last, it was my turn. I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki Bento—a safe, classic choice, or so I thought. The price? A staggering $14.95. For that price, I expected a taste of Mount Fuji itself.\n\nThe first red flag? The chicken looked like it had fought valiantly in a grease war and lost. It was drowned—no, submerged—in teriyaki sauce so syrupy and overwhelming it could have doubled as engine oil. The vegetables were limp, lifeless, and tasted like they’d been resurrected from last week’s compost pile. And the rice? A soggy blob that clung to my fork as though it feared the outside world.\n\nAh, but let’s talk about the “tempura,” if we dare call it that. The batter was a soggy, oil-soaked crime against all things crunchy. Each bite felt like chewing on a damp napkin. The shrimp? A whisper of protein lost in a sea of grease. I could feel my arteries pleading for mercy.\n\nAs I sat there in the crowded food court, staring at my meal like a tragic Shakespearean hero surveying the ruins of his life, I noticed something curious: the staff, moving with the urgency of sloths on a coffee break, were haphazardly slapping together orders. Quality control? Nonexistent. Passion? A distant memory.\n\nI left Koya Japan not just disappointed but personally offended. Offended that this establishment dares to peddle such lackluster meals in one of Canada’s busiest malls. Offended that I spent $14.95 to feel betrayed. My stomach churned with regret, and my soul yearned for the innocence I had lost.\n\nTo the brave souls considering Koya Japan: turn back now. Go anywhere else. Heck, eat at home. The culinary gods will thank you, and your wallet will too.\n\nOne star—and that’s only because zero stars isn’t an option."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOcFXLI0fHSydf5iCK8407MQGzii8eGDtxqjqTe\u0026fid=0x0:0x47770b74a4caa896""],""When"":""2024-12-14""},{""Name"":""Michael Kashkov"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUHQqdkZ8UrMNX3JXJAPLi5tzL0seRzCv7BAbjOzZvIyrXvPY1SuA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I cannot believe that I still can get a decent portion of ramen for approx $12 and not be hungry afterwards.

The food and service at this location were consistent with the standards we've experienced at other ZUBU spots.  However, we were slightly disappointed with the ramen noodles — they were soft and overcooked. This was unexpected since ZUBU typically delivers on quality.  We also noticed a steady stream of takeout orders, which may have impacted the kitchen's focus.\n\nOn a brighter note, we redeemed our ZUBU rewards points for their 5-piece Crispy Chicken and Pan-Fried Pork Gyoza, both of which were delicious!  If you're a fan of ZUBU, downloading their app is a must — it’s an easy way to earn rewards and enjoy perks during every visit.\n\nOverall, ZUBU Metrotown is a decent option for a casual bite during a shopping trip, but we hope they can improve consistency, especially with their ramen.\n\n📝📝\n\nFood: 🍜🍜🍜 Can Try!\nService: 👩‍🍳👩‍🍳👩‍🍳👩‍🍳\nKids: 👶👶👶👶 Yay!

Individual portions are even smaller than a mini and the cumulative size of all three is probably similar to that of a mini ( by weight/volume) which doesn't seem to be worth the price as I could get a regular sized ramen for cheaper. See picture of empty bowls for size comparison between mini and those in the flight ( keep in mind that the it's typically filled to slightly below the zubu word on the bowl and that is the narrowest parts of the bowl which creates an optical illusion that it's alot larger than it actually is).

This smallish shop has a few tables on one side of the store and a stand-up counter on the opposite side. Their menu is fairly basic but odds are that you’re coming here for their noodles.\n\nThe server had recommended that I try their Spicy \u0026 Sour Pork Noodles in Soup ($12) so I took him up on his suggestion. I found that the soup was not overly spicy or sour but it is noticeable (especially if you’re unfamiliar with this combination of flavours). I did enjoy the texture and the varying thickness of the long and wide noodles (I need to work on my noodle pull technique). The dish also contained a small amount of thin beef, cut up tofu puffs, and veggies but it felt a bit sparse.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my meal to arrive, I could hear a loud slapping sound coming from the kitchen… assuming it was from them making their noodles. Overall, I was a bit undecided about this dish so I made a note to come back here and try one of their non-soup noodles to see how that compared.\n\nIt actually took me about 4 months before I finally managed to come back for a revisit and this time I ordered the Fried Beef Sauce Noodles ($12). As expected, the English on the menu isn’t very descriptive but I wound up pleased with this dish. Again, there was the loud noodle slapping noise coming from the kitchen while I waited. And they had to ask me to move over to the counter because a larger party came in after me.\n\nThis bowl had a generous portion of long, broad noodles of varying thickness topped off with well-seasoned fried ground beef, sprouts, and a few pieces of veggies. You have to kind of mix it up before you eat and the sauce was only mildly spicy but I did think this turned out quite good."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOoVqnGVt95tlYxcbm0O34WXMImenZz2Q1fGh6s\u0026fid=0x0:0x508af482b715f32e""],""When"":""2019-6-11""},{""Name"":""Jim Fong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV3tXWnX8xFhA_qZcSgIAVcjedjNVtb5Riz6aB4ltUNzTkDmgfU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Food were served in plastic takeout containers.

Dumpling House frequently when it first opened, but I stopped going after noticing a decline in quality. However, I decided to return last week, and I’m pleased to say that things have improved considerably.\n\nThe Xiaolongbao and dumplings are as delightful as ever, juicy, flavourful, and expertly made. The Pot Stickers are also excellent, with their perfectly crisp bases and tender, well-seasoned filling. The Camphor and Tea Smoked Duck is a standout dish, featuring tender, smoky meat and beautifully crispy skin. Another must-try is the Deep-Fried Tofu in Garlic Sauce, which boasts a satisfyingly crispy texture and a rich, garlicky sauce that’s truly indulgent.\n\nWhile some dishes remain slightly greasy, it’s within an acceptable range and doesn’t overshadow the flavours. Dynasty Dumpling House seems to have regained much of its original quality, making it a fantastic choice for authentic dumplings and a variety of other flavour-packed dishes.

So keep in mind that if you are visiting with a group, be sure to phone in and reserve a spot, especially on the weekend. Parking was a little cramped underground, so you may want to park at the mall or even take transit here. My group was greeted at the door, and ushered in by an attendant fairly quickly (due to our reservation). Service at the time was a little slow, but this is inevitable when the restaurant is full, so no problem at all. The food variety was alright with your meats like lamb or beef, vegetables, and other appetizers. Note: upgrading to deluxe would allow you more seafood options for around $10 more, but honestly didn't really seem worth it. For our first and second orders, we did notice however that some of the items did not show up but to be fair, with the variety of food options, it wasn't that big of a deal. Both the regular and spicy broth were excellent, with the sauce bar full of options to create dipping sauces. Bonus free ice cream bars at the end of our meal too. Just keep in mind, last call is at 10:30pm so be sure to order before that time. Also kudos to your servers, as they went from table to table to personally ask if anything else was needed before the last call.

Everything was delicious! However, I am deeply disappointed with the oyster motoyaki. $8 for 3 tiny cut up chunks of oyster in a egg tart sized tin. I have ordered this for years in different restaurants never have I ever received such sad quantity of oyster motoyaki (with the exception of all you eat portions). I'm so BAFFLED AS HOW CAN THIS BE ACCEPTABLE TO CHARGE $8 FOR ALMOST NO FOOD to be completely honest. I went to the restaurant in person today to speak to the staff. They wouldn't do anything except say that each chef prepares whatever portion they like and they have no control. And that is how they serve the food and how they charge the food. Not sure how they can accept that type of service. I am actually furious!!! Fuming!!\n\nAlso forgot to add - how dismissal the staff was who kept telling me they have no control on how the chef prepares the dish and told me just not to order it next time. I wasn't there to blame anyone (seems like that's what they were concern about). I wanted to let the staff know that to charge that amount for this little oyster is outrageous!!!! Yes inflation is terrible and food cost has risen, but this was the most expensive item in the whole order. It just doesn't make any sense that they would be proud to serve this.\n\nUPDATE: I have listened to their suggestion to not order oyster motoyaki at their restaurant. I've haven't been back and don't plan to. I've been enjoying oyster motoyaki at other Japanese restaurants 😅😊 toodles!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNUgbYyZW17JD0X5NtXs1gNnav-AN9NYpN8J-EH\u0026fid=0x0:0x38427c9559d6dad5""],""When"":""2023-9-8""}]",

It would be if you asked before taking pictures in the store.\n\nOverall a nice dining environment, however the retro style decor and interior design could possibly give off a rusty/musty feel. The store is very clean however, so rest assured.\n\nThe store owner, young man with black mask and black cap, is friendly once you talk to him.\n\nThe fried chicken tastes alright, slightly sweet fried batter outside and juicy chicken on the inside.\n\nHowever, compared to other Korean fried chicken places I don't notice too great of a difference in flavor.\n\nThere is a great difference in price though, something I love about this place! You can get 6-7 pieces of chicken for $11, which is their \""small\"" order.\n\nOther places only have a half/full order, while K chicken has a small order- kind of like a taster.\n\nWould come back again!

The garlic sauce they use was a delicious add to the burger. The only thing I wish they offered was half orders of the chicken bites so I could have tried more flavors at once.

Instead of an initial apology, what we got was doubt until they realize that it was in fact a roach in the food. They offered to make another bowl but I instead requested a refund. Afterwards, I was offered another bowl to which I rejected and asked them to check their ingredients just to make sure. The server said it was probably from the lettuce and barely expressed an apology which was concerning. However, upon examining the photo we took, the roach looked cooked. We then assumed that the roach was fried in one of the display lights and then fell onto the guac. It was also noticeable that this branch was messy, unclean, and did not feel up to standard. This experience was overall upsetting as Chipotle as we usually have a good experience in either downtown or in the Metrotown branches. Hoping that the CFIA does something about this as this is a health and cleanliness issue as confirmed by the other 1 star reviews as well.
