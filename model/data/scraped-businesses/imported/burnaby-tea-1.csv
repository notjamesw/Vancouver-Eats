I found that interaction suspicious and to my surprise I was right, the mango chunks were indeed old and not edible at all. I knew the taste was off as soon as I ate it since it was way too mushy so I took a piece out and it was brown meaning the mango chunks had rotten. I contacted chatime customer support the same day of purchase and it says they reply within 10 business days. However, is been over a month since the incident and all I got is dead silence. I have both proof of purchase and pictures of the mango being brown and gone bad but no reply. I had gotten sick from consuming just a few sips fortunately I threw away the drink otherwise I would have probably ended up with a bad case of food poisoning. However, the lack of reply and accountability of Chatime has soured my experience with ever going back there as someone who used to buy it once a week for $10 each time I expected at least something edible and if the employees knew something was up they should of spoken up and asked to change my order.

In all these years, I cannot recall a single bad experience. My friend who lives next door told me her entire life’s story at the table by the window. I’ve stared at the same cabinet full off bubble-tea related gifts for years. I’ve watched as their decor changed slightly, adding plushes and cactuses, and the small changes in their menu. I’ve genuinely saved money through their student deals, and the amount of toppings they offer is top tier. I don’t know where I would be without a small, comforting place nuzzled in my life like Tealips. Coco’s mass produced pearls got nothing on my love like Tealips. I’ve sat at those tables as a child, with a mask on during COVID, and even now as a struggling student. In the grand scheme of all things of life, so much is moving, but not Tealips.

The tea tastes very different from most other places--- I suspect it's a combination of the type of creamer and the type of tea they use. The milk tea here tastes almost creamy; the sweetener in combination with the creaminess always made the tea taste a little like cake.

I went with their house special with wontons and hand sliced noodles. The broth was hot and didn’t taste too artificial. Portions were good as well.\n\nWe also ordered several fried baskets like chicken baskets and squid baskets to share amongst ourselves. The portions were so large that we couldn’t finish it even though there were quite a bit of us there.

They even played the 'happy birthday' song which was great!\n\nThe interior and lighting was also nice. It was modern and brightly lit and seating was comfy.\n\nThe only con I would say is the parking. I would advise to park at the BCIT parking lot nearby and just walk here during busy hours because it's a nightmare finding parking here when every Asian person is parked on a lane with their hazard lights on.\n\nOverall, this was a great establishment to have a birthday dinner with lots of people.

Here’s a rundown of what I experienced:\n\nThe first dish was a beautifully presented plate of clams paired with slices of sponge gourd, all nestled in a light, flavorful broth. The clams were fresh, and the subtle sweetness of the sponge gourd complemented them perfectly. The lightness of this dish made it a refreshing starter, ideal for those who enjoy delicate flavors.\n\nI also had clams in black bean sauce. This dish had a rich, savory profile with a slight hint of heat. The black bean sauce was robust, yet it didn't overpower the natural taste of the clams. Topped with fresh green onions, this dish was a delightful contrast to the lighter first course.\n\nFinally, I tried their beef noodle soup with pickled greens, I think it was A2. The broth was deeply flavorful, likely from hours of simmering, and had a wonderful depth that was both comforting and satisfying. The addition of pickled greens brought a tangy, slightly spicy element to the dish, balancing out the richness of the beef and broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the beef was tender, making each spoonful a perfect bite.\n\nThe service at No. 1 Noodle House was equally impressive. Stone, Lucy, and Lily were attentive, friendly, and made sure that every aspect of the dining experience was seamless. Their recommendations were spot-on, and they truly went out of their way to ensure we had a great meal. It’s clear that they take pride in their work, which added a personal touch to our visit.\n\nNo. 1 Beef Noodle offers a great selection of well-prepared dishes that cater to a variety of tastes. Whether you’re in the mood for something light and refreshing or rich and savory, there’s something here for everyone.

Nice creamy texture, good mixture of all the toppings (you won't run out of sago before you're done with the drink). This is my second time getting it, probably my fave drink here.\n\nVery Mulberry Heytea ($8.99): This was recommended as a highly popular item, but I'm personally not a fan. It's a dark purple colour, tastes just like grape to me. I don't really like grape generally. Nice slush texture, similar to the mango one.\n\nPure Regal Aqua Green Jasmine Tea ($4.99): Just a regular ol' jasmine tea. Super light and refreshing for a palate cleanser.\n\nNo where to sit! take-out only. You can walk around Crystal Mall or go up to the food court.

My fiancé and I visited Sun Tea tonight, October 4, 2024, around 7-7:15 PM. We were excited to try this location, smiling as we looked at the menu. However, the experience quickly became disappointing due to the attitude of the cashier.\n\nWhile I was looking at the menu, I asked the cashier a few questions, but he seemed uninterested and visibly annoyed. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he might be tired so it’s okay.\n\nThe first question I asked was which category of drinks could be substituted with a milk alternative. He said \""fresh milk\"" in a tone that made it clear he was irritated. Again, I let it go, understanding he might be having a rough day.\n\nThe second question I asked was whether they could make drinks in the fresh milk category hot, since the menu didn't specify, although I saw hot cups available. He simply replied, \""No, we don't make hot drinks.\""\n\nWhen it came time to order, I asked for a Sago Taro Fresh Milk with oat milk. He said, \""No, we don’t have that,\"" and then looked at his co-workers and laughed. They all laughed…. He probably thought we wouldn’t notice… If Drink was not available, I wished they marked it as unavailable or sold out, so I found this reaction inappropriate and upsetting.\n\nFeeling uncomfortable, I decided to order something else and chose the Sugar Pearl Matcha with oat milk. It was clear to me that the cashier noticed my change in tone, as his attitude suddenly improved. He even offered, \""Would you like to make that hot?\"" I replied, \""But you said you can't make it hot, right?

ETea was able to throw in a discount so the drinks came out to just under $100, the drinks were ready at the time I was picking up, and my entire team greatly enjoyed the afternoon treat! Thank you for accommodating my team and making all of our bubble tea dreams come true, ETea! 😊\n\nAdditionally, we live in the neighborhood and really enjoy going to ETea for snacks or a meal. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. Our kids usually order the popcorn chicken rice or chicken wings, and the adults usually get the garlic scallop fried rice (ask for their hot oil sauce!), laksa, or curry. Their fresh fruit slush bubble teas are refreshing, and when we ask for the toppings on the side (when we dine in), the staff are always happy to accommodate us and bring us extra cups and little spoons for our kids to pick and scoop the various toppings into their individual cups.

They happen to be on the Fantuan App so I ordered our drinks using Fantuan. I ordered a Pu'erh Sparkling Tea for my husband and Pu'erh Milk Tea at 50% sweetness for myself.\n\nPu'erh Sparkling Tea: A huge disappointment. We couldn't detect any sparkle in it, it wasn't at all sweet, and was very much lacking in flavor.\n\nPu'erh Milk Tea: This drink was wonderful. It was very tasty and instead of the usual sphere shaped pearls that bubble tea drinks usually contain, it had these cube shaped jellies in it. These cubes seem to be what Ben Gong's Tea is known for as I had seen them in photos many times in the past before we finally tried out this location of Ben Gong's Tea store. I enjoyed the cube shaped jellies. They were fun to chew on and felt lighter in my stomach than pearls, which left more room in my stomach for dinner afterwards. My one complaint about this drink is that while it was tasty, it was...too tasty?! This is the drink that I had ordered at 50% sweetness. We suspect that they mixed up our drinks by making this Pu'erh Milk Tea at 100% sweetness and making the Pu'erh Sparkling Tea at 50% sweetness.\n\nService: Fair\nOur drinks were ready in timely manner; in fact they were ready for pickup ahead of the time that I had selected on Fantuan, and the people working conducted themselves with the average manners that might be expected anywhere else. Yes, we do think they mixed up the sweetness levels of our drinks, but people do mistakes from time to time. So, rather than mark them as \""poor\"" for the mistake, I rate them as Fair.\n\nParking: Paid parking in the parking lots at SFU.\nLocation: At the MBC food court inside the Maggie Benson Centre at SFU."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNmbUYHh2mstlTq3F72VFSb51D6K0ylsj71IUGk\u0026fid=0x0:0xa24f5b15628e471d""],""When"":""2022-12-8""},{""Name"":""Katelyn"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLQIwBxiymLsTGTi8q9SuUfVg6cYF3oto9uF9nYpHXKwqlEK_o=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""ordered a green tea boba milk tea and it tasted very diluted. expensive af too"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ian Z"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXRD69bLI6epbo8wWFLN_HxNGw8DOAiqjSEQ72lgsfa3MmR2Jk=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We ordered drinks and it took us ten minutes to get to the shop which is inside a building.

The scone was a big surprise to us - it was served a little warm, and the inside was super moist. The earl grey flavour was also very pleasant and strong. The Mocha Cube Loaf was moist - the texture is quite like a banana bread but mocha flavoured, but this probably has the most subtle flavour out of everything we ordered.\nThe Spanish Latte came with a very cute bear latte art.

This is probably going to be the last time and maybe it's good for them that they don't have me as their customer. The drinks are okay but there is no customer service at this place, especially this time when they made me walk back with the drinks. The person who made my drinks doesn’t seem to be okay with my feedback based on how he reacted, but I think I’m entitled to give feedback as a customer. The reason I give them 2 stars is because they at least made a new drink and up size for me this time, it’s wed anyway, otherwise I would rate them 1 star. I know that he may think he's very good at his job and probably believes he made the very best drinks, but if he put his ego down and listened to customers, he would understand that the drink tastes different this time. That's all I wanted to say. He wasn’t rude or anything, but his facial expressions and words sounded ironic. He seems upset when his colleague’s asking what’s going on. In the end, I just walked away with the new drinks he made (which actually taste better, saying this with no bias).

I'm not a frequent flier at this Mall so perhaps these places have been here quite some time, but at the very least, it does seem like there is an inordinate amount of bbt houses all sequestered in this sector.\n\nTae Tea is a fairly new addition to Crystal Mall. Easily accessible as a place you have to walk past in order to get into the actual Mall, they have as good a chance as any other bbt place for success.\n\nI was in the area with my aunt so we decided to stop in. The 20% off all drinks statement stuck onto the window was very appealing, and even more so were the $6.70 drinks, making this one of the most reasonably priced places around.\n\nI'm not really sure how to describe the decor, as like a lot of bbt places here at Crystal Mall, the shop is so tiny that there really is not much room for anything other than the menu, their logo and the requisite fire alarm. However, they did have an astronaut statue set up in one corner and a gigantic moon slapped onto one of the walls, so let's call this Cute Space Chic.\n\nTook awhile to read through their menu as they certainly played to a little bit of everything in terms of their selections of Milk Teas {made with organic milk in case you're wondering}, Fruits, Slushes and Yogurt.\n\nEvery place seems to have a shtick or gimmick and one or two drinks that they are famed for, and here the shtick/gimmick by my estimation would probably be the Blood Rice inclusion in a few drinks which I have to admit that I have not seen anywhere else. Nor am I tempted to try it.\n\nThey also have grape themed drinks, Creme Brulee Milk Tea and Caramel Mochi. Honestly who needs to find a dessert place when these bbt houses are basically taking care of the dessert portion and the drink with their 2 in 1 concoctions.\n\nOne of the things I found really amusing was that I wanted to pay by cash and the guy told me that while they prefer card they do accept cash, and proceeded to slide open this small section of plastic with an adorable bear etched onto it in order to take said cash. It was like doing a transaction at a bank, which I found vaguely amusing.\n\nThey ran out of my first drink choice of Spring Peach Oolong so I tried their Fruit Ceiling while my aunt grabbed a Lychee Crush. I don't know if the name got lost in translation since the Ceiling kind of threw me off, but my aunt joked maybe it was so named because they fill the fruits to the Ceiling... of your cup.\n\nThe Lychee Crush was really good, but then again, it's one of those drinks that are hard to screw up. I was in for a shock with my Fruit Ceiling though, because it is the best Fruit Tea I've ever come across. It was the perfect amount of sweet, my preferred watery consistency, made with fresh fruit, and more importantly, there were no seeds floating around to hinder the taste or experience.\n\nI will absolutely be going back and recommending this place to everyone I know, so do yourself a favor and Tae~k a chance with Tae Tea."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPGqR8N-ugvw7kcG8w2okwChRZ1nTuQeSR39RXg\u0026fid=0x0:0x34751812440ab34""],""When"":""2023-12-15""},{""Name"":""Steven"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXnQiOkF5sJ1SPN7-mjrJfpw0uWYTc5vuRtXWGOkGAglcsEiJmP=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""First, I tried to order the mango pomelo, but was told the mango was out of season which is fair.

Why not at least cover them up on your menu?\n\nI ended up ordering the Fancy Grape. I was not expecting it to contain tea because it doesn’t have “tea” in the name (nor 茶 in the Chinese name). The tea flavour was way too strong. I ended up throwing it away because I can’t have caffeine in the evening, and because it tasted disgusting.\n\nI pointed this out to the cashier, but he didn’t even try to provide me any compensation.

They do brew their tea fresh and on top of that, their fresh fruits are literally squished and blended fresh as well. It was quite delicious. They have tons of options as well. The menu is the typical Chinese style of Boba with TONS of choices and mixes and matches for your type of drink. On top of that, they have special flavors like Salted Egg and tons of Asian mixings like red rice and tea flavour foam. It really was very different, and I can only see Crystal Mall being a place which has something like this!\n\nI do enjoy such innovations and new flavours and fun things like this, but at the same time, I wish it was more available everywhere else.

Each sip was a burst of tropical bliss, perfectly sweet, and refreshingly tangy, capturing the essence of the fruit wonderfully.\n\nThe overall experience at Paradise Juice was delightful. The combination of genuine warmth from the owner, the exceptional quality of the juice, and the reasonable pricing makes it a must-visit spot for anyone in Crystal Mall. It's a small, unassuming place, but it packs a punch with its authentic, homemade-style juices."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP1Ar410OzNInhj5jyT7wR8S1n3OWWOSIcCEmI\u0026fid=0x0:0xd9ebc3427dc8c85""],""When"":""2023-12-23""},{""Name"":""Munchica"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbQ6ACs51IPQJlRLrmnunOErED8bimOf5-y1uov4EWpuZvjQQjrA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing hidden 💎 gem for 100% fresh squeezed juice at a great price!

been here a few times and the staff have been consistently unwelcoming with bad customer service. The first time the girl got my order wrong. Then she refused to correct my drink and instead insisted that I ordered it. I left unhappy and none of the staff seemed to care.\nYesterday we decided to try it out again. Arrived and there was a BIG sign right in front of the till that said “After school special, 2 large drinks for $10”. So I ordered two of the golden aged milk tea with pearls. The lady said ok and asked what level of sugar and ice I wanted. She tried to enter it into the till. She had troubles applying the special deal and then asked her colleague. They spoke in their own language and tried to figure out how to input the deal. They could not figure it out and looked confused. Then a few minutes later she looks at me and says “The special is no longer available!”. I asked her why would you advertise something on a huge sign that is not available and then told her to take the sign away so as not to confuse customers.

While she bought herself the ever so fancy Bunny Jelly Mango Smoothie, I ordered a Passionfruit Green Tea with Lychee Coconut Jelly from the Happy Hour menu.\n\nTwo thumbs up to both drinks, and I know from previous visits that they do very nice brown sugar pearls for anyone who's a brown sugar pearl fan.The store is clean, bright and spacious with several tables well spaced apart from each other.\n\nService: Good\nParking: Free parking on the street and side streets\nLocation: 6271 Kingsway, Burnaby"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPRjJbk820_xpu56CJCHjrC7yxuZh8_5SVrTEB7\u0026fid=0x0:0x95697b070e540101""],""When"":""2023-4-28""},{""Name"":""DK NG"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKDL3iKzA-KwRBp_QW-T4bxIzouYpU82YVrkKDRjecsEEcAnsE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Another new store!

World Burnaby:\n\nThe sole purpose of this review is to assist and friendly remind the restaurant of their inconsistency with this highly rated dish and their response in handling the situation.\n\nPINEAPPLE SHRIMP BALLS - received has NO SAUCE. Called back the restaurant and inquired if they revised the recipe and/or just missing the sauce (comparing to picture shown)?? The staff responded they are certain there is sauce but if still unsatisfied we can pick-up a \""free sauce for our next visit\"" as a solution for missing in this order. Phone was placed on table while inquiring with packaging/kitchen staff that handled the order. Loud strong vocals in Mandarin argumentatively of certainty in preparation and in no way for error..fighting back with FOH staff via convo on phone. Few months earlier, this same situation occured WITHOUT sauce - and when contacted via app, uber just thanks you for your feedback regarding missing sauce (no refund), and left unable to enjoy the dish properly. This is the second time. This is the 2/2 orders we made for this dish and we find this troublesome, time consuming and distressing over a simple dish.\n\nAt the end, drove all the way back to Bubble World Burnaby and they gave a replacement, while showing them the order made incorrectly.\n\nThey suggested for next time to ask uber for full refund on entire uber based on this one dish error. That would completely unfair for the business and I don't recommend doing that in response.\n\nDon't recommend ordering this dish/ Recommend ordering Chicken Nuggets \u0026 Taro Milk Slush instead."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMThQtfoNX2hDtxUoCJa23FdHDbQ16cOcpCc_Vr\u0026fid=0x0:0x554265aac79f232c""],""When"":""2024-10-10""},{""Name"":""Miss Lynne"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXwRhjfH5-OHpuQthobphDEGqrTSpZc4Skj0JUJTU7B1tP8bS8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""My friend \u0026 I was waiting 15mins for seating and I noticed 3 tables available but the girl did not seat anyone.

I opted for an iced americano and a chocolate chip cookie, simple items that were hard to mess up. The staff were warm but seemed slightly uncoordinated. For instance, I ordered a small iced americano but received a larger size instead. This wasn't a problem for me, but it could be concerning if another customer experienced the reverse situation. Although I was the only one waiting, the barista had to call for me from across the counter and ask me what I ordered, which was strange. It seemed like they were new, so I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. As for the food, the chocolate chip cookie was mediocre. The center was unbaked and it tasted as if it were missing an ingredient.

Unfortunately, the experience fell short of our expectations.\n\nStarting with the pesto chicken focaccia: the bread itself was disappointing. Focaccia is typically known for its airy, slightly crisp, and flaky texture, but this version was far from it. The bottom bun was soggy, and overall, the sandwich lacked the fresh, well-textured bread that makes focaccia so enjoyable. The chicken itself was even more of a letdown—boiled chicken breast with no seasoning. It felt bland and lifeless, lacking any of the flavors you’d expect from a pesto chicken sandwich. We found ourselves reaching for the ketchup served with the tots, which speaks volumes about how little flavor the sandwich had on its own.\n\nThe salad that came with the combo was unremarkable as well. It consisted mostly of plain greens with no standout flavor or dressing that could complement the other parts of the meal.\n\nService was another area that needed improvement. After our food was brought out, our server didn’t check in with us, and we were left without basic essentials like salt and pepper, which could have helped improve the meal’s flavor. It was surprising that we weren’t offered any, as it seemed obvious we needed some seasoning to bring out the flavors of what we’d ordered.\n\nThe bacon croissant sandwich fared slightly better but still wasn’t impressive. The croissant was decent, though it didn’t have the flaky, buttery texture that a well-made croissant should have. While not as bland as the pesto chicken focaccia, it wasn’t memorable either.\n\nFinally, the Oreo iced latte was another disappointment. We had hoped for a drink with a unique twist, but it turned out to be just a standard iced latte with crushed Oreos on top. It tasted like a quick gimmick rather than a thoughtfully crafted beverage. We would have preferred an option to have it as a hot drink, which could have added a nice contrast to the flavors.\n\nOverall, this visit left us underwhelmed. Between the subpar food quality, lack of flavor, and inattentive service, we don’t see ourselves coming back to 1003 Brunch and Dessert. There’s potential here, but for the price, we expected a much better experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPUH29NlM-CmBLD_LOmlcSeukanEn_fDcv2d-TP\u0026fid=0x0:0xd6f82a5318716098""],""When"":""2024-11-11""},{""Name"":""cat"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUOpJ0p_oeAe5MdNgkzgRlfQlHruhwSqcfe0RoRC2l6Ja8sIdzz=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food was great!

this coffee shop. While the food offerings like the chicken pesto sandwich, lemon loaf, and cappuccino were just average, nothing particularly wowed me. The lukewarm cappuccino was a bit of a letdown, and the self-service pickup system could use some improvement—I almost missed my sandwich sitting on the counter. On the bright side, the place has a cozy atmosphere with stylish furniture, fitting well into the community vibe it aims for. Plus, the spacious layout and large tables make it a great spot for group gatherings. However, the parking situation can be a hassle. Although there's a lot in front of the community center, it tends to be busy, so be prepared to circle around to find a spot.

At that price, what did we have to lose? Wow, this Lobster Melt was no joke! It was affordable and delicious. My husband and I agreed to share a Lobster Melt sandwich with each other, but it only took about two bites at most for him to decide that he wanted to buy another one so that he could have it all to himself!\n\nThe Chocolate Lava Cake was also quite impressive.

They kinda overheated the Carbonara sauce, making it clumpy and scrambled, which made the pasta very dry. For it to be $22 (shrimp+fettuccine was additional 💰) was disappointing.\n\n🍝Chicken Alfredo with Homemade Fettuccine ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nDefinitely tasted better than the carbonara, everything was good. Although I can certainly make the same taste at home.\n\n🍕Margherita Pizza ⭐️⭐️\n\nIt was a bit different from we imagined, the crust tastes like those frozen ones, but the topping was good. The tomatoes were fresh and delicious, there was decent amount of cheese. $11 was fair, you get what you pay\n\n🌯Tuscan Chicken Panini ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nHonestly the best looking dish out of everything we ordered. It had lots of cheese and meat, $16 was fair\n\n☕️Drinks ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nDrinks were surprisingly good! We have ice-frapp and italian soda, both tasted really good, although a small frapp is $6 lol\n\n🍽️Service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nThe service was amazing, staff were very kind and attentive. Willing to make fresh fettuccine when they ran out 🙏🏻 I appreciate that!\n\nOverall:  2/5\n\nA bit pricey for what they served, maybe order their drinks and breakfast.

Recently, I have seen an employee named Jackie behave in a very disturbing way towards both colleagues and customers. As a psychologist, I can make some guesses from Jackie's perpetually aggressive uncomfortable gaze and perpetually sweaty face. Anyway... In the morning, while he was interfering with a colleague in an unpolite manner, I said with a smile that this was Jackie's rule, not Starbucks'. He angrily kicked me out of the store. I asked him why he was so rude because I hadn't seen other stores charge extra for the milk added to the coffee. When it started to get uglier, I said, why are you so nervous and making people unhappy? From the way people were looking at me and because I wanted the topic to end, I showed him my phone and asked him if he would fire me once again to dissuade him. It started to look even worse because I was calling the police, let alone being quiet or polite. You wouldn't want to see the gaze of employees and customers. I wrote this with the thought that maybe Starbucks officials could save customers and store employees from Jackie.

I think some people didn't have either and were disappointed especially after waiting in line so long. Tried the pineapple green tea since I loved it from yifang but it was watered down and the pineapples just felt like an afterthought. Also tried the soy milk black tea latte which tasted like sweetened soy milk with hardly any tea flavour. Then also had the qing green milk tea which was the best of the 3 drinks and had some light tea flavor. Came back another day since there was no line and got the orange guava tea which had so much pulp on the bottom with no guava flavor and the passionfruit pineapple Qing tea was another disappointment because it tasted like soap.

I had the picnic, which was great, and an iced Americano that was certainly above average—robust and refreshing. The daily soup was another highlight for me; it was rich, comforting, and exactly what I needed on a chilly day.\n\nThe café also boasts a charming outdoor seating area that I took note of for future visits. It seems like the perfect spot to enjoy a coffee and meal outdoors, especially with kids. The ambiance of the café, combined with its tasty offerings, makes it a fantastic place to chill with friends or enjoy a family outing.\n\nI’m already looking forward to my next visit to Café at Mandeville, to enjoy not just the ambiance and company but also to relish their food and drinks in the lovely outdoor setting."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNCucD3E4Z1C6Q9i-NFQJr961PEfp_wyO9KrYiQ\u0026fid=0x0:0xf13d8715535fd701""],""When"":""2024-11-14""},{""Name"":""Shirley Ann Harris"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLTufZ1O7YNqmevegFQNEbK68BixarB9ooeJyWD92O9OkSBiQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I've been to Mandeville gardens multiple times but have never eaten at their cafe!

All customers were enjoying themselves in their own ways.\nWe ordered a BLT and turkey meat panini with coffee. I loved my BLT as I could taste the freshness of the veggies from their crunch. The bacon was crisp like chips. While munching his panini, my husband kept praising how much turkey meat it was in the panini. He complemented that he has never had such a \""generous\"" panini before. Lol.\nI think we will soon become regulars to this cafe.

I personally rather pay for a more expensive cup of coffee than tip, as I usually only sit for 15-30min, and take my own cup/plates away before leaving.\n\nSmall cafe, about 4 small seats and a few by the bar so it does fill up fast. There's a large parking lot for the plaza, but it's paid parking only. Prices are pretty standard for a small local coffee shop. Overall, I'd recommend this place in Burnaby, walkable for both Royal Oak or Metrotown Skytrain station. It's a cute place to check out if you're ever craving a non-chain coffee shop in Burnaby!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNbOuj3gbTcj9acCPqWdnx3kX2STza0i0QMdfPd\u0026fid=0x0:0xda7ea3a05cbeab79""],""When"":""2024-12-24""},{""Name"":""Cindy Xu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkWnRcqRwVg_mpqM7f4VioaCJHawOmYOsqXy6htya5AhFjkbgY1w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The Hojicha tea latte has a very smooth taste and was served by Diana, who is so friendly to customers coming into this corner coffee shop.

The interior is beautiful and I love the attention to detail. There is a wide selection of tea to choose from and I enjoyed the Mumbai chai. I was surprised to see our teapot arrived with no tea bag or tea leaves inside. I don't order tea often but when I do, the tea is left to brew which is great for those of us who enjoy a stronger cup of tea.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian high tea and my partner had the standard. There was little difference between the two. His arrived with one chicken sandwich and my alternative was a tofu sandwich which unfortunately I didn't enjoy. The sweets were good but again, for the most part, my partner and I did not enjoy them. I appreciate that this is about individual taste rather than the actual quality of the sweets. It is not possible to order anything else from the menu on the weekend other than high tea.\n\nThe website lists a spring and a summer high tea amongst others. When our bill arrived, I was under the impression, given that we are still in spring, we would be charged for the spring high tea however this was not the case. When I asked, I was informed that the spring high tea menu ended on mother's day and that they are on the summer high tea menu. This surprised me as we are still very much in spring.\n\nOver the years I've tried several different high tea options both here in Canada and overseas and unfortunately this high tea wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOG-IuC0ze63cWkMnbZ8VLCG7_Jjxi5E8-xq15M\u0026fid=0x0:0xda28c3280cbe4ac6""],""When"":""2024-5-29""},{""Name"":""Andrea Smith"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLpuVBU8Cr4kuXCWAkWLm8v5JbEFLyz07AUAoxz_KpO9adA0u7P=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Went to the Wicked themed high tea and it was fantastic!

Upwards of $60 for a three tiered delight of sweets and savouries, you are paying for the \""experience\"".\n\nThis includes being surrounded by a medley of disparate but charming decor that somehow manages to look like it all belongs together, the use of fine china dishes, delicate teacups, and usually an actual bowl of sugar complete with a tiny metal spoon. A rounded pot filled with aromatic loose leaf tea rounds out this teaparty, a decidedly more adult affair than the one we used to have as kids using stuffies as guests.\n\nHigh Tea is a luxury to be sure, not an everyday event. The Secret Garden was my go to, but I was persuaded to try Neverland. I wasn't expecting anything different in terms of the novelty, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much better the service and overall encounter was.\n\nAt Secret Garden, you choose one tea and are stuck with it for the duration of your stay. It is also up to you to steep it for however long you see fit. Neverland is unique in that you are encouraged to try different teas after each teapot is drained. I think that I sampled at least four. Not only that, but they actually brew and steep the tea for you so that the guesswork is taken out of the equation. A great marketing strategy on their part, as if you happen to fall in love with a particular tea, it is available for purchase.\n\nFoodwise, the items at Secret Garden are laughably smaller than Neverland's. And the famed lemon tart and egg salad on a pink bun\nthat are constant fixtures on the Secret Garden High Tea menu have long since lost their appeal.\n\nI am a carnivore at heart and usually give vegetarian items a hard pass, but I found myself tentatively nibbling on the vegan savouries and finding them to be surprisingly delicious. That alone has ingratiated Neverland to me, because trust me, I'm the first one to decline any vegetable that crosses my path.\n\nOur server at Neverland was constantly checking up on us and ensuring that our table always had a steady stream of filled teapots for my party and I to mix and match. Once the server delivers your three tiered meal at Secret Garden they seem to disappear and only reappear to hand you the bill.\n\nSuffice to say you never need to settle for a merely passable High Tea service again. Head over to Neverland for a few hours of enchantment, where everyone is indeed mad as their sign implies, but in the best way possible."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTxNHm8VjDgHJRg-xkfdnVcN0KjdEhoJI3GqBo\u0026fid=0x0:0xda28c3280cbe4ac6""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""W"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVijg2B2FKhHEO0daffmmkqtpWCzt3aDQdnZOIHflF7afjJd1G7=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""2023: Mad Hatter's high tea.

I remembered clearly at the time of ordering to check for their closing hours to be sure that I can pick it up on time and that they weren't closing early for X'mas (both the Google hours and their main website said at the time of ordering that their store closes at 7 pm/ regular hours so I proceeded with ordering).\nWhen I got to the Richmond store on Dec 24th at 4:15 pm, I then realized from the sign posted outside their door that they actually closed at 4 pm. I want to thank the staff that they still opened the doors after hours when I knocked, thank you to one of the ladies who called her manager to let her know about the situation and thankfully, in the end, I was able to still pick up the order but I want to raise a few concerns here:\n1) I would not have ordered from Paragon if I knew ahead of time that they were closing early or I would have arranged someone to pick up for me. I have done my due diligence to check for their holiday hours on the day of placing the order. Their holiday hours should have been posted on their main website given that they have an online ordering system on this site and they have order pick up available on xmas Eve (even until today, Dec 24th, the holiday hours aren't posted). The hours on google were not updated until the day of. The receipt also does not indicate pick up deadline. I raised this concern to the staff at pickup that their hours aren't updated and her response was that this is posted on Instagram. There shouldn't be an assumption that all their customers follow  their Instagram or that their go-to would be to check Instagram for their hours, especially when there is a store website and the Instagram account is not the first link that is attached the Google business page. I could not find a phone number to call either to give them a heads up or inquire what to do in this case.\n2) It would be appreciative if the staff could have called the customers who did not pick up their orders (or even called 30 min before closing which some other stores would have done) or sent an email regarding this which will highlight more professionalism here. When asked about this, the staff answered that they have too many orders to call the customers (which is interesting because do they have many orders left behind by customers who do not pick up their order for the day they ordered for).\nIn summary, I still want to thank the staff for taking their time for helping me but I hope the store understands the frustration for a customer who is trying to rush from work and hoping to gift the cookies for an X'mas dinner.

They had good food, prices, and fast service.  And while the staff are doing an amazing job pushing the current place to 150%, the management decisions that brought it to where it is now, were clearly awful.  The food prices have gone up on average of two dollars since last year, while also shrinking the portion size by almost a third.  The quality of product has also fallen sharply.  There are two active lines of food here, one for Tim Hortons express, and the other for the grill, but management has apparently closed one of the two tills, forcing everyone to go through the grill checkout from the beginning of the grill line, even if you just wanted a coffee.  This negates the value of an express line, and was not a problem before the \""upgrade\"".\nNow the head chef lady, who has been working there forever, doing a great job cooking good food, is tethered to the only till, while her colleagues scramble faithfully to keep up.  This is not a fault of the staff, but rather, the management.  Merciless cost cutting is to blame.  If management were to push the cost cutting any further, this establishment would likely become profit negative.

If you haven't filled up on Tea, then the meal itself would require you another stomach.\n\nTo be fair, Afternoon Tea consists a lot of Bread, but the fillings were hitting all the right spots. The Crab Cake was also quite good, a bit salty, but a great addition to our meal. We also prdered Sushi, which was also good, but we were so full by the end!\n\nThere was a party also happening while we were dining, so keep in mind there is not a lot of privacy in the dining area.

It was ok; the pastry wasn’t light and flaky as I prefer; salted duck egg spongecake which was very sweet and the salted egg taste was barely noticeable; durian ice cream shake. This was a tad too sweet and didn’t have enough durian; red bean mixed with coconut milk (I didn’t try enough of it to comment on it; Vietnamese calamari. This was so good 👏👏I was surprised; deep fried pho noodles with stir fried beef and greens, another dish that surprised and delighted. 👍; pan-dan tofu with brown sugar pearls in coconut milk. I’d definitely recommend this! 👍👍 This is a very popular Vietnamese restaurant. Dinner time is very busy and reservations aren’t taken.

Do not lie to my face and say you clean the floors everyday. You can’t lie and say that this amount is accumulated in one single day.\n\nBest course of action is to make sure floors are done both before opening AND after closing…\nPlease clean the floors… seriously.\n\nThis is a food service business not to mention a business franchise. Fraser Health have already been notified about this.\n\n——————\nUpdate 10/16:\nAddressing the response received from BLENZ management - it is understandable that being in a mall with a pest issue is inevitable but the responses from that one employee (female, young Asian with glasses) is extremely offsetting and off brand. Overnight accumulation of rodent droppings is something you cannot prevent, I won’t deny that! However if this was something you have already been aware of and not actively trying to do more cleaning makes it very unappealing to consumers who drop in to purchase FOOD and DRINKS. These aren’t products that you can “clean” and “sanitize” after purchase before use.. these are products purchased to be consumed before they go bad.\n\nAgain, I know what a single night of rodent droppings accumulation looks like, it is definitely not what I saw and photographed. If cleaning was maintained twice a day, daily.. there wouldn’t be 1 speck visible during operating hours.

of the Hart House team are absolutely amazing.

Guests kept complimenting me on the food selections and dessert choices! Overall, Hart House is the perfect place for a lush green and quiet lunch and dinner, for exploring the grounds and Deer Lake, or for a major milestone event like your wedding day.

They offered a amuse-bouche that was very tasty and pleasant.\nEverything was well seasoned and delicious. Gnocchis melt in your mouth and fish/scallops were perfectly cooked. The scallops and the mushrooms in ricotta gnocchis were AMAZING! We felt the care that was put into cooking the food by the chefs.\nWould love to visit again to try other dishes soon.\n\nThe server was very nice, friendly and accommodating.\nThe only thing we missed was the overall service was slightly slow.

It’s really gross.\n\nThe one factor that made me decide to give this a lower rating was because of the price and their marketing. This is ridiculous! $7 for a drink? That’s a price of a meal at a food court!\n\nWe got one of the top 10 drinks from the poster. The toppings and pearls in the pictures looked refreshing. But when we ordered it, not only were there NO toppings or pearls, it was $6!! With no toppings? That is disappointing. They’re lying, with putting the picture of the toppings. If the toppings were included I wouldn’t have complained. He marketing isn’t honest.\n\nAs much as I want to go and leave a one star rating, I have to admit that the quality of their drinks are actually decent.

For the portions you get, it's very good value.\n\nI did have to signal to the waitress to take our orders because it was taking a while for someone to come, but it was smooth sailing after that. When the restaurant's full and you have to wait for a table, you can grab a number from their iPad at the entrance."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPwksGfPauNNIe53aTr3COdaEYiyH-A4ir3BEYh\u0026fid=0x0:0xb5e1aba68aa033f2""],""When"":""2024-5-21""},{""Name"":""Daniel Sung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ61DoMscspD7FnxbNGw4d3f5Af7KsUdL6bkhk3NlkyiWvRZg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Average solo hotpot.

The entire neighbourhood is a huge development in Burnaby.  It’s a very popular place to live and work.  There are tons of stores nearby so you can shop till you drop.  Then come to Starbucks for some R\u0026R.  The location is perfect for access or a meetup, because it’s literally right beside the Skytrain.  You can’t miss it.  It usually has a water fountain out front which adds to the experience, but sadly it wasn’t working on the day I visited.\n\nThis Starbucks sits on top of a McDonalds, and both places have large windows to sit beside and watch the world go by.  Starbucks has a unique wrap around corridor with ample seating so that you can get a good view, no matter where you sit.  Lots of light to say the least.  Perfect for the long Vancouver winters where light is the most valuable commodity.  Even the McDonalds below the Starbucks appears to have a very interesting open concept design.\n\nI was working on a tower nearby so I had to be at work early, and thankfully the Starbucks was open.  Their hours are amazing.  5:30AM-10:30PM on most days.  Great for construction workers or anyone with unusual  work hours.  Shooting the Starbucks at night was almost more interesting than the daytime because the light is so dramatic.  I also came to Starbucks during the day for coffee, and also took more pictures.  My day ended at 8:30PM so I was able to snap a few more night pictures at Starbucks, grab some of their delicious Avocado spread which I'm kind of addicted too, before hopping on the train.\n\nAs usual, wifi, food, ambiance, and coffee was great.  I know what I’m getting at Starbucks and I love that predictability.  Also, the staff were excellent.  Very friendly and helpful.  I was so surprised to see the option to tip the staff with a card.  Usually most Starbucks require a manual cash tip.  The nice barista said that this new tipping method “may” be rolled out to all Starbucks.  That would be great, as cash isn’t the most convenient thing to carry around.\n\nAll around great coffee shop in a very attractive mall that sits in a very attractive part of Burnaby.  Brentwood is popular and appears to be thriving.  Lots of towers going up around here, for good reason."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPXrPk4nn0x2hbUaNye5kS4vjhFfnblTAolt3uZ\u0026fid=0x0:0xd0051032d291910b""],""When"":""2023-4-6""},{""Name"":""Edgar Ignacio"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV7oexz4qXoBKr6ujKuYxwMvlf16ckv-ovFMKFmC4nzUqeMSoelFA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Very good location along Brentwood district with ample amount of seating inside the shop.

Living there has been like stepping into a storybook, with its tree-lined streets, charming shops, and a community that seems to know everything about everyone. But beneath the picturesque surface lies a complexity I’ve come to appreciate over the years.\n\nOne of the things I cherish most about Brentwood is the sense of belonging. The neighbors are warm and inviting, always ready to lend a hand or share a story. However, this closeness also comes with its challenges—gossip travels fast, and privacy can feel elusive. There’s a strange mix of comfort and tension in knowing that while people care deeply about each other, secrets rarely stay hidden for long.\n\nThe town’s beauty is undeniable. Early morning walks through its parks or evenings spent at local cafes have been some of my most peaceful moments. Yet, Brentwood isn’t just about charm; it’s also about resilience. I’ve seen the community come together during tough times, whether it’s rallying around a struggling neighbor or organizing events to support local causes.\n\nFor me, Brentwood isn’t just a place—it’s a feeling. It’s taught me the value of connection, the importance of community, and the complexity of human relationships. My experience here has shaped me in ways I never expected, making it a chapter of my life I’ll always treasure."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOytb9dmZF-Xi7n1Z8HORDwQxAmNCUlaPjE88aQ\u0026fid=0x0:0xa9a6f1bb9a10b040""],""When"":""2024-12-24""},{""Name"":""Brady Elliott"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKi1pj4abmRBJQ1ixuQcdi42JGVfbXcdJyhbFynVEdAbRi5RA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""If you like peace and quiet and a super outrageously uniquely designed mall that virtually is empty.

decent, clean and spacious. They have outside seating which I appreciate a lot!\n\nFood: Just tried their Jupiter sandwich. I had high hopes but it wasn’t able to deliver. It lacks any and all texture, a mostly haphazard construction of very mushy ingredients. A well soaked beef dip is still more interesting. The taste is not for my liking but it is not bad. There is not enough harmony between flavours, and zero texture is making it even more apparent. I believe having a better roasted beef that has a bite to it would elevate the sandwich at least one star!\n\nCost: It is not a cheap place, and with the lackluster sandwich, it is quite low value.\n\nOverall, this is a nice looking place with nice people working inside. If they improve their sandwiches, it’s well worth a visit.

slightly salty food, but not the friendliest of service. We went for the happy hour dim sum over the weekend. We made a reservation for 2:15 but since the dim sum happy hour doesn’t begin until 2:30, we were only seated around that time. Whether it was because we came for the happy hour, it was not very clear. Just as we were seating, they asked us whether we wanted tea and walked away without hearing our response which was really rude.\n\nAlso when they gave us the menu, it wasn’t clear which ones were included in the promotion on the menu provided and the server left so quickly we didn’t get a chance to ask. It was 2:40 pm at this point and we were hungry so we just ordered as is from the non-crossed off items.\n\nThe dessert was the first to arrive at the table, before any of the other food, which was unacceptable.

pleasure of dining at Brown Social House and left thoroughly impressed by both the cuisine and the service. I ordered the Butcher’s Block Burger, which featured a perfectly cooked, flavorful beef patty topped with crispy, smoky bacon and crisp, fresh lettuce. The attention to detail in the preparation was evident, as each component complemented the others beautifully, making for an incredibly satisfying and well-balanced burger.\n\nWhat truly set the experience apart, however, was the outstanding service. Erin, our waitress, was attentive and genuinely friendly, making sure our needs were met with efficiency and a warm demeanor. Her professionalism and positive attitude contributed to an inviting and enjoyable atmosphere. It’s clear that Brown Social House prioritizes both the quality of their food and the experience of their guests.\n\nFor anyone seeking a combination of excellent service and a delicious, thoughtfully crafted meal, I highly recommend Brown Social House.

We returned for brunch and had a wonderful experience. Special mention to our server, Ella, who was very attentive with our food, dietary intolerances, and hot water refills. We had the Angus Beef Hash and Blackened Chicken Wonton Soup. The wonton soup was great, but a tad spicy for my taste buds (in the future, I'd ask for the chili oil on the side). They have large TV screens as well, so it was nice to catch some morning hockey while dining! Looking forward to returning to this location in the future, given the exceptional service.\n\nCame here with a group of 8 for an early dinner. We were sat at a higher table with barstool seats, which were hard to move (as they don't glide on the flooring). Being middle-aged, some in the group needed help from others to be \""pushed\"" closer to the table. The food was good. I had the Crispy Cauliflower and Crispy Yam \u0026 Avocado Roll (which was average for the $11 price). The cauliflower had a nice breading and was flavourful, and felt like a slightly smaller portion (\""social hour\"" portion).\n\nWe had some concerns with the lack of service. We constantly had to flag down our waitress as we wanted to place part of our order before 6 pm to take advantage of the social hour pricing. My glass of water never was refilled during the meal. For a large group, it would have been nice to get checked in on from time-to-time, as a courtesy. Because of our group size, we still had to pay the automatic 18% gratuity, but we didn't think the service warranted that amount. The food itself did come out in a timely manner and was done correctly with some diners' special requests. When asked, our server was able to take a group photo of our table.\n\nAmple parking in the parkade below with a 3-hour limit, which I was told was a non-factor after 6 pm when I called the restaurant ahead of time. Overall, we had an average experience! While the food was decent, the service for our larger group left a bit to be desired (3 stars)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMRMdbceD5gvubL_XIV_xZyV73uBO4uvNPN8nFX\u0026fid=0x0:0x1f96fae1d97e6d13""],""When"":""2024-8-30""},{""Name"":""Chris Yeung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUcT6Z40EZW4C3yt0N7VoX3tM1V1mzzAe7xxRrgBiMmtInx7b7I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went to Brown's Socialhouse Brentwood to celebrate a friend's birthday.

I ordered an iced oat milk Earl Grey bubble tea. The pearls were very soft and chewy, and the tea had a rich and fragrant flavor. Since I had my dog with me, I sat at their only outdoor table. Soon, a very friendly staff member came out and asked if they could give my dog some free ice cream. When she brought out a cute little cup, I saw some things that looked like chocolate chips on top. I thought they were chocolate chips, but she explained that they were carob beans, which are safe for dogs, and mentioned that she also had a dog. My dog gulped it down in just a few bites.

I paid $16.99, as their menu described, so I just can't figure it out. Did only this location raise the price? Either way, they need to update the menu. I might be overreacting, but I kind of felt scammed.\n\nI visited this location around 9PM, but there was no one at the front, so I waited for a while. When no one came, I called the store, but no one answered. After waiting a bit longer, a server finally appeared and took my takeout order. I was told it would take 10-20 minutes to prepare my food. I got my order after about 20 minutes, which was fine.\nThe store didn’t seem busy, so I think they may be understaffed. Prices are the same as on third-party platforms, so I think it's more convenient to just order through them.\n\nLastly, I usually go to the downtown location, and I really enjoy the taste, the crispy tempura, and the delicious sauce there so .. 2stars for the Brentwood lolation but I'd give the downtown location 5 stars."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMbbZ3e6bXK0XGg2HyShtChf8BPjdBw-AxT6yNW\u0026fid=0x0:0xee3e26a6ee0d36cd""],""When"":""2024-12-22""},{""Name"":""Nikki Sy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBjATsJMmB41G9yqWFoEPo05_lPP8oOi4rOJgcyxBVDlQkbFzp=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""My husband and i ordered deluxe omelette curry and beef curry.

How has it taken me this long to visit this place? This has got to be one of my favourite tea houses in Vancouver now!\n\nWhat I love about this place is the variety of options they offer. There are options for omnivores, vegetarians and vegans at this place. Not only do they cater to different dietary restrictions but if you're wanting to spend a little less, or eat a little less they offer Mini Afternoon Tea sets! Regular Afternoon Tea sets are $55 per person and Mini Afternoon Tea sets are $38 per person. Oh, and  you can even order off a regular a la carte menu if Afternoon Tea fare isn't your thing.\n\nThe food here was excellent. Quality ingredients were used for our food and they didn't skimp on anything either. While 3 of us had Afternoon Tea, my husband decided to order from the a la carte menu. He had a lobster bisque and a sandwich. One of the best lobster bisques he's ever had. Possibly even the best!\n\nIt's a popular place so I do recommend reserving well in advance to get a good table. We reserved only one day in advance and were put on a couch with two very small tables in front of us, and a side table on our left. It took quite a bit of maneuvering to fit our food and drinks on the small tables provided, and I had to turn to my left to pick up the very heavy teapot every time I wanted to pour some more tea for any of us. The lady who took my reservation over the phone did warn in advance that it would be a tight spot. I don't think I realized just how tight it was going to be. Wouldn't take this seat again, but with a bigger table I would absolutely come back to this Tea House sometime!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNGepJ-3zwdqTsikLOpbLpdiYS7ml8NzTpTATdO\u0026fid=0x0:0x9663a4eb1eadadb6""],""When"":""2024-5-8""}]",

Nice flavours between the earl grey, honey and nut cream. We liked how thick the nut cream was as it held well in transit, along with the \""hunny crumbs\"" and almonds. It was $10.20, which is a similar specialty pricing to Hot Chocolate Festival drinks.\n\nCustomers can adjust ice and sugar levels in their drinks. It's wonderful to have a \""mylk\"" tea shop focused on vegan options. Unfortunately, it's quite pricey as my nut mylk with pearls is regular $9.45 (before tax). I'm not in the Kitsilano area often and wouldn't make a special trip out, but I'd return if in the area for a treat!

From its clean and modern ambiance to the wide array of delectable beverage options, this place has firmly secured its spot as one of my favorite spots on campus.\n\nUpon stepping into Sharetea, you're greeted with a vibrant atmosphere that effortlessly blends contemporary aesthetics with an inviting charm. The place is always bustling with activity, a testament to its popularity among students and tea aficionados alike. Despite the constant influx of customers, the staff here is remarkably efficient, working diligently to serve you your coveted cup of bubble tea in a timely manner.\n\nWhile there might be instances where you find yourself waiting for a brief period, the tantalizing drinks that await you are certainly worth the patience. Sharetea boasts an extensive menu that will leave you spoiled for choice. Whether you're in the mood for a classic milk tea or seeking a burst of fruity flavors with a vibrant fruit tea, this place has it all. Each drink is crafted with care and precision, ensuring a delightful and refreshing experience with every sip.\n\nWhat sets Sharetea apart is its commitment to quality. Each beverage is meticulously prepared using premium ingredients, resulting in a remarkable balance of flavors. The pearls, or boba, are consistently cooked to perfection, boasting a delightful chewiness that adds a textural element to every sip. Whether you prefer your pearls to be sweet, caramel-infused, or bursting with fruity flavors, Sharetea has got you covered.\n\nWhile Sharetea focuses solely on beverages, its dedication to perfecting the art of bubble tea shines through. The absence of food options, even as snacks, may seem like a limitation to some, but it only reinforces their commitment to providing an exceptional beverage experience. After all, it's all about the tea here, and Sharetea certainly excels in that regard.\n\nTo fellow tea enthusiasts, I cannot recommend Sharetea Bubble Drink at UBC enough. It's a haven for bubble tea lovers, offering a clean and modern space, prompt service, and an array of mouthwatering drink options. So, if you find yourself on campus and craving a delightful bubble tea experience, head over to Sharetea and let your taste buds embark on an extraordinary journey of flavors."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPPnxrML75hCtgIyxLvPFtciYusAAPbYMoAAHP8\u0026fid=0x0:0x706f1e599f8463a8""],""When"":""2023-7-13""},{""Name"":""Deborah Aiko Insook Kim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWkrXzRxO3A2OGqiLyPY_PlsYk2B44E-xgPkg6UAgy-1KwY7fkT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great place for milk tea lover!\nI found this place in UBC before and got a chance to sit in!\nCOVID-19 makes so much different for everythings.

Only 1/4 of the cup was a drink and the rest was foam.\n\nWhen approaching the baristas to rectify the order, they tried not to make any eye contact with me. When asked about the lack of a drink in a 16oz cup that was full of foam, got told in an obvious manner that cappuccino IS SUPPOSED to be HALF foam and HALF liquid.\n\nNot only is that not true, our drink was only 1/4 of a drink. Truly disappointing about the product and the customer service.\n\nI insisted on them adding more to the drink, and begrudgingly the barista did a quick one ounce pour in the cup.

The staff is really chill and friendly so the vibe is great, and the food/drink is good all around. In particular they have some of my favourite scones around. Their veggie sandwich is very very good (as long as you're prepared for your hands to smell like focaccia for the rest of the day). Except for during the summer, they have a daily soup which is always very tasty. The regular dessert pastries (brownie, cookies, dessert bars) are all good but not stand-out good, but they sometimes have fancier cakes which are amazing.\nFor their drinks, it is also really hard to go wrong. The masala chai latte is amazing - it's sweet but also richly flavoured with spices. The London fog is also very good. Both of these tea lattes use stone ground tea instead of brewed tea which I think contributes to the intensity. They do a great job with the matcha latte too - it's never clumpy at all. I used to be not the biggest fan of their coffee, but it's grown on me a lot. It's a bit on the acidic side, but if you don't mind that, then the flavour is pretty nice. I really like their mocha too (especially the peppermint mocha available in winter) - this is actually the only place where I really get mochas!\nThey have pizza nights now (7-10 Wed-Fri) where you can get a flatbread pizza big enough to feed two for less than $15. Only the very basic flavours available (margherita, bianca, or pepperoni), but super tasty (and cheesy).\nThe seating inside is limited and the space is so narrow that I find it very hard to be comfortable inside unless you go during a rare quiet hour, but I love the patio, which is huge and mostly covered. They sometimes turn the fireplace on during the cold season."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPWhxuY6zE3pvpsEAp5I-7RS-wKJgHl_8B7qvR0\u0026fid=0x0:0x58f47ab4d39c9e95""],""When"":""2020-10-24""}]",
