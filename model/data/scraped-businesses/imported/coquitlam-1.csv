I opted to dine in after the thorough explanation and genuine service even before I sat. Once I settled on an order the staff loudly shouted to the kitchen staff and proceeded to hand me utensils/water. Moments later I could hear a meat mallet being slammed against what can be presumed to be my order (pork loin cutlet). Not long after I sat down another customer came in asking to look at the menu and explaining they're unfamiliar with the concept. the food came out quickly. The deep fried loin was pleasantly plated; light tasting; and juicy with flavour. 5/5 food. 5/5 service. 5/5 ambiance. Seems like cabbage salad sides are unlimited too! Beginning to end this was 5/5.

Everything was very tasty, the Nasi Goreng had still a kick to it despite asking for mild. My complain was that the shrimp chips were a bit stale. The beef skewers were kind of on the skinnier side, but were definitely not dry and the peanut sauce was amazing. The crispy pork belly was probably what shined the most. I’m not a huge pork belly fan but this pork belly was not too fatty, extremely moist and tasty. We even got a free dessert at the end which was a pleasant surprise, and it was a delicious way to cleanse your palate after meat/spice.

and definitely will be back but most likely grabbing take out over dine in if coming on the weekend. Came here for the first time on Sat, Oct 20th for brunch at 11:15 AM, it was packed and we (2) put our name on the waiting list, it took about 45 mins to get a seat which was the only negative but we figured it must be good considering how busy it was so we waited. The seating is a bit too close for my preference to the point there is no privacy to have a conversation while you eat but I get they are likely trying to maximize the seating, it's also a pay up front before you order type of establishment so just keep that in mind. Not my favourite since I like to tip well but based off the service so in these pre pay scenarios I unfortunately just have to go 15% because I'm hoping it's going to be good, but I don't blame them with all the shady people these days doing dine and dash and etc.\n\nThat's where the complaints end, the food was absolutely amazing and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be coming back and seeing if they're a bit less busy perhaps for a later brunch around 1:30-2 PM next time and if not I'll stick to take out."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM4miz5R1JAfwId5oUPDkbUvfO1VKqG9oN3FhiG\u0026fid=0x0:0xaafa76a6be83bd15""],""When"":""2024-10-20""},{""Name"":""Tyler"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV44fpfaEhe-NUZmd0KxbQW5h4ZO24PneHP0Sgtc4_visySni_S=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I can't say enough good things about the food.

The combinations were great.\n\nThe plant based bowl was equally tasty with the chorizo style no-meat.\n\nThe server was very kind and was excited to help us out of provide information.\n\nThe problem however, is their pay-at-window system. They require you to pay prior to being served and their system pops up for a tip of 15% or more, prior to having had any service. I voiced my frustration to the server and although she was understanding, this seems to be a growing trend among many small restaurants.\n\nI don't feel comfortable tipping without service first, and especially when ordering food first, you feel compelled to tip so the restaurant gives you good service. This \""good tip first = good service\"" needs to stop.\n\nIf not for their tip system, I would easily rate this place above and beyond.

First, we came on a Sunday around noon for brunch. Sundays are a very busy day, so we expected a waitlist which is totally fine. We waited about an hour for our table. There was so many people leaving, after an hour of not receiving a call we came in again to check how it was going, they apologized said that it was so hectic they were behind with calling the customers. When we finally ordered and sat down, it took quite a while to get our food. I ordered the chicken sandwich, and I was really disappointed when they put pickled peppers and onions on it when it never stated on the menu that it was on the burger. I didn’t bother saying anything because you could see the staff were already really struggling to keep up with all the orders. Second my two friends ordered the acai bowl, and one was completely forgotten all together. We had to go remind them that we never received an order. I do not blame the workers that day, if anything we really felt bad for how stressful everything was. From my understanding aswell is a lot of them were very new, and being new while working a Sunday ,plus understaffed is understandably very overwhelming. We even noticed they were accidently overcharging guests, and not being able to refund them due to the new machine system. One worker really stood out though; I believe her name was Lea. She was so kind and was going above and beyond to try and fix all the problems and issues that the restaurant was having. She was really trying her best and it was lovely interacting with her. She alone made our experience a lot better. The food we received itself was really well made and very delicious. ( Besides having the pickles peppers/onions on my sandwich ) But Like I said before, I had such high hopes for this place, unfortunately due to our experience and the stress it caused us , this place would not be our first choice to come back to.

The vermicelli was fresh and well-cooked, served alongside crisp vegetables like bean sprouts, cucumbers, and lettuce, which added a nice crunch to the dish. The fish sauce was light and tangy, complementing the savory pork perfectly without overwhelming the flavors.\n\nThe balance of flavors in this bowl was spot on, and the accompanying spring rolls were crispy and packed with flavor, a fantastic addition. The presentation was also great—very appetizing with vibrant colors.\n\nService was quick and friendly despite the restaurant being busy, and the atmosphere was casual and inviting. Whether you’re a fan of pho or looking to explore other options on their menu, I highly recommend giving their pork vermicelli a try!\n\nThis captures the key aspects of your experience while emphasizing the flavor and overall atmosphere of the restaurant!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM5qsIkpneH8Vr6cu3bOhK43yolHJZKWNakgeS-\u0026fid=0x0:0x55e781ca19889a62""],""When"":""2024-10-11""},{""Name"":""Brandon Collins"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXJftMou5k5OJyPtZPxUAjCRk0hWFHK-OghGtQJYsSNzGar9YlLzA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Saw this place on an Instagram reel showing of the variety of traditional veitnamese dishes , all of the meals looked amazing so I had to try it for myself .

I have also been to their new location on Kingsway. We have tried many different dishes from their House special pho, spicy beef pho, house special with saté broth, their rice dishes, vermicelli dishes, chicken wings, salad rolls, and their bahn mi. We have brought our friends and family several times to eat at Pho Superbowl because we loved their food and generous portions.\n\nToday, I ordered #66 grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli which I have had plenty of times before, but for some reason, the grilled pork tasted sour and off, like the meat had already gone bad. I waved down one of the servers to let them know and she was nice enough to offer to change it to a different meat. I picked out all of the spoiled meat into a small bowl which she took back to the kitchen. Then, I heard the head cook angrily yell in the background. Shortly after, a different lady came back with the same bowl with the spoiled pork and said they can't give me a new one because \""I already ate it\"". What do you mean I already ate it? It wasn't like I finished all the food and asked for a new bowl for free! I just took out all of the spoiled pork out of my vermicelli bowl and planned to eat the rest of the food!\n\nI am beyond disappointed especially since we loved coming to eat here and we were always generous with tipping.... but we are not coming back. I understand that restaurants can sometimes have a one-off, and I am usually willing to give another chance.

This was $6 during happy hour!!\n\nI decided to have the chole Bhature, the chole (chickpeas) was very flavourful. Not overly spicy at all as I requested mild. It came with yogurt, pickled carrots, and some veggies. Overall I’d give it an 8/10, it definitely satisfied the craving. I appreciated the price point of $13.\n\nMy boyfriend had the butter chicken with garlic naan, he said he enjoyed it. He specifically mentioned how he like the creaminess of the dish! The naan was a little too crispy for me but I enjoy the tastes I had.\n\nWe also finished off with rasmalai (no picture sorry) and it was a perfect end to the meal.

Each hot stone rice bowl set comes with flavorful Korean side dishes and a daily soup, which is always one of the highlights of Korean cuisine. On this visit, I was offered a spicy beef and silky tofu soup, which was both rich in flavor and incredibly comforting.\n\nFor the main course, I enjoyed a whole crab and two prawns. To make it easier, they provided disposable gloves for handling the crab shell. Curious about the best way to enjoy the meal, I asked the server for a recommendation. She suggested removing the crab meat, mixing it with the hot, steaming rice, adding an egg yolk and flying fish roe, and then topping it all off with toasted seaweed. The result was fantastic—rich, flavorful, and incredibly satisfying!\n\nOverall, the experience was a perfect blend of great food, attentive service, and a memorable meal."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOfQ0DUcbW3jtlTCqTJslbdoDJSbOkQ7SoIXn6E\u0026fid=0x0:0x6e59361dade417d0""],""When"":""2024-11-8""},{""Name"":""Jessameen Dela Peña"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX9mRpmL8-ZJUG7UPFcnsjzRdxjABif-MswbO1rxgJyyWfns8Jd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We enjoyed the Kosoo Combo C for 2, which included Beef Short Rib, Marinated Beef Short Rib, and Marinated Pork Galbi.

The main bowls were delicious for both sets. However, they advertise this to be with a variety of banchans (Korean side dishes) and to be honest..I was excited for the banchans. To my disappointment, it came with the absolute bare minimum- kimchi, bean spout salad (you can get these for free at literally any traditionally korean restaurant), and cold jeon. I think the salad was just to fill the tray. The “daily soup” was also disappointing; there were literally just slivers of radish and fish cakes. I was expecting something more substantial, even something like 된장찌개. Maybe they felt pity for this sad tray of banchans bc they put a random bottle of yakult on there as well.

Super comforting flavours.\n\nWhen delivery people arrived without their warming bag, staff would ask them to retrieve it. This ensured the food would stay warm.\n\nI would highly recommend the seasonal specialty, Khao Soi. This was our first time trying it, and I'd definitely order it again. This dish comes with crispy and soft noodles. When you stir it into the sauce, the fried noodles stay crispy, giving you an amazing combination of textures. Beautifully balanced and satisfying dish.\n\nWe also enjoyed the crispy wraps, chicken satay and Pa-Nang Curry.\n\nVery relaxing environment, and I'm glad we popped in.

The restaurant offers a traditional North American Japanese menu with no fusion or modernized dishes, nor any super high-end options. However, the craftsmanship of the food, its presentation, and the exceptionally friendly atmosphere make Nagano Japanese stand out.\n\nOur meal consisted of several small dishes that we shared, all of which were expertly prepared with fresh ingredients. The raw seafood, including uni, salmon, toro, fish roes, and tuna, was especially delicious and fresh. But it was the cooked dishes that really impressed us. The fried softshell crab had a thin, crispy batter, yet the crab itself was still tender and juicy. The fried salmon cheeks were also fantastic, with succulent, tender meat clinging to the jaw bones. And the grilled mackerel was cooked to perfection, with crispy, thin skin that was perfectly browned and charred.\n\nHowever, what really made the dining experience memorable was the friendly hospitality of the owner or manager, Susie. She was patient, accommodating, and genuinely made us feel welcome. She made everything great with her personal touches on customer interactions.\n\nIt's unfortunate that there have been several negative reviews lately, perhaps due to a shortage of qualified staff or an increase in takeout orders. Nonetheless, some of the best dishes we had could only be appreciated when freshly cooked and served straight from the kitchen."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOgmliG0wkzCCsfYn85x-UYasSgQBkHZy1LkHwG\u0026fid=0x0:0x7f9ed62ea165733f""],""When"":""2023-3-19""},{""Name"":""Mina A"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUa3Ot95qqtO1ooc2Pz-iCEqTxvgYh82KnLf13it1wz8uNx1lvA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""This was the second time we ate here. First time was in 2018 or 2019. My partner didn’t want to come back because he insisted the food wasn’t great the last time we were here. I convinced him that every place deserves a second chance, especially after so long! Upon arrival, we were told to seat anywhere we wanted outside as we wanted to be out on the patio. We chose a table far from the other couple that were already eating on the patio (this table wasn’t quite clean and was a bit slanted). A few minutes later the server came with the menus and moved us to another table that was “level”. But this table was not clean either and there were no chairs, so I had to grab my own chair to help the server out. She wiped down the table after we were seated, so 2 dirty tables even though the restaurant was not that busy. There was a sour smell in the patio the moment we sat down (my partner thought it could be dog pee?). No soap in the men’s washroom. Strong urine smell in the women’s bathroom. We ordered 4 items. The crispy shrimp appetizer with salad and sweet chilli sauce was delicious but would have been better if the sauce was served on the side in case someone doesn’t love the dressing. Gomae wasn’t crisp/fresh. Considering the higher prices on the menu compared to other Japanese restaurants in the city, we had higher expectations. For the mains, we got the sizzling scallop and the black cod. The dishes didn’t arrive together. The sizzling scallops were not really “sizzling”. There were 2 scallops with some mushrooms and vermicelli on a shell over a candle. It tasted good but the portion was small and it wasn’t that special for me to want to try it again. The black cod was charred in some areas and the portion was also small for the price, didn’t come with any sides either but at least it tasted good. The sever never came to check on our food or if we needed anything else, only came once to refill the water/tea, and once more, about 5 minutes after we had finished our food to clean the table and bring the bill. She was very nice though. If I only were to rate the food, considering that it was not exceptional and it was pricy, I would conclude that it’s a 4/5. But considering everything else, I have to deduct a point (I wish I could deduct half points, in which case I would have rated it 3.5/5, but because google maps only does full points, and I just can’t see this place as a 4, then it gets a 3/5). Overall, we are still not impressed , maybe even disappointed a little, and will not be returning. Thank you for having us though."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNHe6tz4z7F8SQgqo6zMn7pmnL65n6Rp0VzItOq\u0026fid=0x0:0x7f9ed62ea165733f""],""When"":""2023-5-21""}]",

No base whatsoever.\n\nHand shredded chicken salad - extremely small. Most places that give smaller portions have expensive jellyfish in the salad. This place is only chicken and preserved vegetables so there is no need for it to be half the size of the plate, smaller than other specialty chef items.\n\nDeep fried chicken knees - giant pieces only to find out it is 80% batter. The garlic salt and spice just sat at the bottom and the chicken was never stirred with it.\n\nMinced pork fried glutinous rice dumpling - the glutinous rice wasnt very sweetened.

Specializing in Sundaegukbap (blood sausage soup), this restaurant delivers rich, savory dishes that capture the essence of traditional Korean comfort food. However, for those unfamiliar with offal or sensitive to distinctive food aromas, it might take some getting used to. That said, once you acquire the taste, it becomes incredibly addictive.\n\nTheir spicy stir-fried gopchang (intestines) is another standout dish, offering just the right kick of heat. Pair your meal with traditional Korean makgeolli (rice wine) for an authentic dining experience. This is a true gem for those who appreciate down-to-earth, everyday Korean dishes that tug at the heartstrings of home-cooked nostalgia. Whether you're a long-time fan or new to Korean cuisine, this spot is sure to leave a lasting impression."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNmjMSNdMGaNsa1YsVZlsKT7zba-V7Z7hmCXrcu\u0026fid=0x0:0x60a421469c3df69c""],""When"":""2024-12-9""},{""Name"":""Nhi Hoàng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK1QePYF-UVINbDSSmftKYTXlpwLQZXczMrhEF9IMEzva6RJX0=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The restaurant is small, crowded during peak hours but the food quality is still delicious.

Both were delicious. My husband said that the burger is one of the best that he has had. The burger was loaded with tomatoes, bacon and onions and he really liked the burger sauce that came with it as well. The bacon was thick and my husband said that the caramelized onions made the burger. I also found my Clubhouse to have been very good also with thick bacon, ham, and a generous amount of grilled chicken. The fries were crispy and the picture with the Clubhouse did not have all the fries that came with the order. We both have left overs for tomorrow.

Despite the restaurant not being very busy, our server seemed disinterested and hardly checked on us. We had to flag them down multiple times just to get basic things like water refills.\n\nThe food, which I was looking forward to the most, was underwhelming. The pierogi were bland, lacking any real flavor or seasoning, and the filling was far too dry. The borscht was greasy and tasted more like something that had been reheated multiple times rather than freshly made. It was also way too salty, which made it hard to finish.\n\nThe manager/owner, when I raised my concerns, was dismissive and unhelpful. Rather than apologizing or offering a solution, they seemed indifferent to our experience. It’s always frustrating when management doesn’t take feedback seriously, and it only made the situation worse. It felt like they weren’t interested in improving their service or maintaining customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I won’t be returning.

The decor reflects Persian culture beautifully, creating a cozy yet sophisticated vibe.\n\nOur friends and family come from all different backgrounds, but this restaurant has a way of bringing us together. No matter where we’re from, we all share a love for the incredible food and the warm, welcoming atmosphere here. It’s a place that feels like home for everyone.\n\nThe food is absolutely outstanding—every dish bursts with authentic flavors, from the tender, perfectly seasoned kebabs to the aromatic saffron rice and hearty stews. The side dishes, like eggplants dips, fresh salads, and tangy yogurt dips, are equally delicious and pair perfectly with the main courses.\n\nWhat truly sets this restaurant apart is the exceptional service.

It’s a reflection of the care and respect the team has for their guests, and it’s something we deeply appreciate. It’s rare to find such attention to detail, and it makes every visit even more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to the owners, the talented kitchen team, and all the lovely staff who make this place so special.

I’ve had the chance to try it a few times in Turkey, but nowhere was as good as this place.\nSecondly, I’d like to mention the cleanliness of the restaurant. Restaurants reflecting Middle Eastern culture usually look a bit shabby and not very modern. This restaurant was different; it was both very modern and very clean. When I asked to see their kitchen, I saw that everyone was working according to hygiene rules. Additionally, their kitchen was spotless.\nLastly, the owner of the restaurant hosted us wonderfully; he was very attentive.

We ended up getting the Tebboki or however you say it, some honey butter chicken, some fried squid, as well as the kimchi.\n\nThe chicken gave me a mouth orgasm, although, this could have been because I was rather inebriated on various cannabis products.

The Qabli rice and white rice were standout dishes—perfectly cooked and full of flavor.\n\nAlthough the seating area is small, the quality and taste of the food make it well worth the visit. Prices are very reasonable for the generous portion sizes. To top off our meal, we enjoyed their refreshing saffron tea, which was the perfect ending.\n\nA big shoutout to the lady who served us—she was so polite, kind, and attentive, making our experience even better.\n\nWe’ll definitely be coming back soon.

I even got in trouble for trying to leave a google review and snapping some pictures being kind and saying nice things about this restaurant.

I expected less quantity but they give big portions.\n\nThe lady serving me was very detailed oriented, slowly stacking the salad making sure pieces dont fall over. The hummus was in a small plastic container that is put into one section of the platter plate. It'd be less waste if they just plopped on the hummus like other places. They give plenty of meat to cover the rice. I asked for extra garlic sauce and they were happy to give it.\n\nThe chicken was nice. Not dry. The lamb however was soggy like it was steamed too long after shaving the pieces.

We were warmly welcomed by every face in there, each person said hello with a smile. The lady behind the counter (I'm assuming the owner?) welcomed us as if we were long-time customers and because of this we instantly knew the food here would be made with love. The atmosphere was very warm and family-oriented. It makes you feel like you're in a safe space and it is very comfortable in there.\n\nWe ordered the donair combos, I had beef with everything and all sauces and my partner had chicken with everything but no hot sauce. The combos came with fries and a can of pop.\n\nThese are some of the best donairs we've ever eaten! And they were huge! The beef and the chicken were season nicely and they were very juicy and fresh. They load it up with meat! The vegetables were fresh, crunchy, and juicy.. it was pleasant. And the sauces were flavourful and delicious. They put just the right amount of everything in these donairs, all of the flavours balance out perfectly.\n\nThe fries are their own catagory- they are so fresh and crispy! Wow! No seasoning or salt is needed on these fries, they are delicious by themselves. We did, however, put the last few bites of our donairs into the fries and mixed it up. And it was a fantastic combination. Highly recommend.\nWe will be back to try the poutine when we are in the area.\n\nMy partner has their heart set on 1 donair place in vancouver as their all-time favorite but they said Uncle Moe's is easily the next pick. As for myself, I say Uncle Moe's has the best donair.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this place to any donair lover, you will not be disappointed in any aspect! 5 stars all across the board.

We have gone there 4 times now and the first two the food justified the sparse interior.  But the last visit about 9 months ago for take out dinner not so much. We live a 30 minute drive away so we expect a special feast when we go there and the prices are not cheap. They charge as if they are top drawer and they have been in the past in my opinion. Their take out this time was skimpy!!!  The deep fried won ton is now some store bought cheap and frugal version and the portion we received was unsatisfying for us three. It was not the robust and plentiful won ton we received on our first visit. And for twenty bucks we get a meagre portion. Sweet and sour really not great either and again for the price why go so cheap! Lastly our fish dish was bland and boring and served in a medium takeaway plastic bowl that could have been a good meal for one, but was rationed out by the spoonful to be fair.\nSo what is your attraction Deer Garden? Friendly welcoming service from your ladies? No thank yous and we didn't feel like our business was appreciated. Good food in portions that justified our 60 bucks?  Nope.

upset by my experience at this restaurant, both due to what I found in my food and the owner's rude response.

She argued that the chicken bone might have ended up in our fries because the same deep-fry basket and oil were used for both chicken and fries. Even if this explanation were accurate, it is entirely unacceptable and unhygienic.\n\nWe left the restaurant without receiving a proper apology, feeling unheard and disrespected.

Despite the restaurant's good reputation, we encountered several issues during our visit.\n1.\tPricing Confusion: The price for a specific dish was different for takeout compared to dining in, which wasn’t clearly indicated in the advertisement outside. This led to some confusion and disappointment considering the service fee and expected tips.\n2.\tService Issues: The waitress was not as friendly as we had hoped, and her attitude was noticeably different when serving non-Persian guests. Additionally, she insisted that I speak in Persian with her, which felt inappropriate.\n3.\tOrder Mistake: One of our orders was initially incorrect. Although the correct dish was eventually brought to us, the delay was inconvenient.\n4.\tTea and Dessert: When ordering tea and dessert, we were told the tea pot was only enough for two people, despite it being sufficient for our group of five. Also, when we asked for extra candy, the waitress’s attitude seemed unwelcoming, even though the candy was a minor request.\n5.\tBilling Process: The process of splitting the bill for tea and dessert was not accommodated. We were told that one person must pay the entire bill, and we would need to settle among ourselves later. This was quite odd and embarrassing, especially since splitting bills is a common practice.\n6. The quality of food was fair.\nWhile we appreciate the restaurant's efforts to provide a unique dining experience, these issues made our visit less enjoyable. We hope these points can be taken into consideration to improve the overall service and ensure a better experience for future guests.\nThank you."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

The garlic naan was very fresh tasting and had good flavor.\n\nOverall, many of the dishes were good and the server was friendly and helpful with describing dishes.\n\nI would definitely come back to try more."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMjVHWe5_Z1UvW7YTHaCkuTZGDbrNMCiP5Dy9-2\u0026fid=0x0:0x35dd030f9f55b602""],""When"":""2022-12-23""},{""Name"":""wilsonjoshwilson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVPoK02al9DYZ9GLC0wDSU4FEAZAAPuuG6qlzOOh_26eyk877fT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Ordered Milaap via UberEats.\n\nI ordered the butter chicken, rice, garlic naan and two samosas.\n\nLet’s start with the samosas..not great. I’ve had a lot of samosas in my day, but unfortunately these are some of the worst.\n\nTasted like unseasoned potatoes with a slight hint of masala..Very underwhelming.\n\nAs for the butter chicken, it had a decent flavour. I ordered hot and the sauce had a good amount of kick. The taste itself was a bit lacking in the depth department, but still satisfied my craving.\n\nSome chicken pieces were a tad dry and it felt like the chicken wasn’t overly seasoned. Again, I ordered via Uber, so the quality could be better if the food didn’t have to travel.\n\nAs for the rest of the food, I enjoyed the garlic naan and didn’t have issues with the rice.\n\nIf you do end up dining here, I would suggest eating at the establishment for a fresher experience."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

I used to love Hons cause they used to have Good portions and amazing flavour for a good price however, things have turned for the worse recently and now even the cheaper TNT meals you can get at the mall tastes better than the food on this day.\n\nThe wonton soup was super salty and tasted very fishy which i’ve never experienced in a wonton soup before (i love wonton soup so that was surprising that it tasted so wierd). I also ordered the beef and brocoli crispy Chow Mein, which is no longer on their menu but the lady said they could make it which is why I gave them a high rating for the service. The chow mein (the whole thing including the beef) tasted a bit wrong like if it shouldn’t be eaten. Not sure how to describe the flavour but it just tasted off and wrong to eat. It was not the flavour I had known and loved hons for, instead it tasted wierd. I am incredibly disappointed that one of my previous favourite chinese food spots no longer have good flavour and have gone downhill. We did order other things as well and honestly the only thing i liked from this whole meal is the rice.\n\nI will be on the search for better chinese food restaurants because i’m so sad and disappointed that this one won’t hold up to a good standard anymore. The service was really good however and they were very quick, efficient and kind so good job on the service. It was the food that was a big turn off. I hope they are able to bring back their old good flavour they used to have in their food and improve on the quality and flavour."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOeS2mABL7p7eLR9gTvg-74i-iEn4ZW4T_qAG3o\u0026fid=0x0:0x95ff28cd48bec56f""],""When"":""2024-9-13""},{""Name"":""Nona SM"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIfjTMq2ZKlGJ4Ldu_6g6I_gZ33bv-9-UjHyDYxTjehH_EmHBBS=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We would rate this restaurant 0 star if we could, The portions are big, but the smell of the food is horrendous so you will not even get to eat the food.

One was great with thick cut crunchy exterior and soft interior, other piece hasn't fully fried to perfection. It's greasy and less crispy.\n\nThe Downtowner Pizza - pleasantly surprised by the amazing flavor honey drizzle on pizza. The heat of the pizza then warm the honey as it mixed with the sauce and toppings.\n\nWings - no impressed.  Originally ordered with Honey garlic sauce toppings style.\nUnfortunately, wings were made with buffalo style and tasted like they half coated them with tobasco by mistaken.\n\nWe have to say they were by far some of the worst wings I have ever eaten.

It’s kind of a smaller place and pretty basic to me.\n\nAnyways, here were the dim sum I ordered;\n\n1. Seafood dumpling in soup. The imitation crab being used made the broth a bit overly sweet, was too unpleasant to finish it.\n2. Steamed spicy beef tripe. It wasn’t tender enough, needed to steam it a bit longer.\n3. Steamed chicken feet with special sauce. It wasn’t tender enough for the skin to fall off the bone, needed to run through the deep fryer a bit longer during the prep process.\n4. Turnip cake with XO sauce. It’s almost a joke, my 10 year old nephew could’ve done better with this dish especially its presentation. Failed!\n5. Baked preserved egg and ginger pastry. Absolutely horrible, the preserved egg was rubbery and the whole pastry crumbled along with its ginger paste. Failed!\n6. Fried vegetables with shrimp paste. An alternate version of the deep fried eggplant with shrimp paste. It was so so.\n7. Baked bbq pork buns. It was okay, the bbq pork could be less sweet.\n8. Purple rice roll with fish paste. It was okay, the super jumbo size was unexpected.\n9. Stir fry udon with live lobster. Surprisingly it was pretty good, enough wok hay to really bring out the flavours.\n10. Little white rabbit pudding. Not bad, cute little treats.\n\nOverall, I wasn’t too impressed with the layout and atmosphere of the restaurant. It portray itself as a mid class Chinese seafood restaurant, but felt l like a simple family restaurant with mid level prices.\n\nThe service was okay, enough to satisfy the basics, don’t expect anything more than that.\n\nAs for the food, honestly it was probably one of the most disappointing experience I had so far out of all the Neptunes I’ve been to.\n\nNot a repeat or recommendation from me anytime soon… 1.5 stars"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQR35TFh2sABn6mWQv4-F7inIjdWxHkqeXqX1w\u0026fid=0x0:0xe8960ddf73ad1704""],""When"":""2024-6-3""},{""Name"":""Danny Y"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8eoyUE6az-FmQo7i2mVq5z64Ow48sgKu1EmLZc0zWWN6DMy5asw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Came for dimsum.

To begin with, the food was served cold, which significantly diminished the overall enjoyment of the meal. One of the key aspects of Persian cuisine is its rich and aromatic spices, but the dishes I received were notably lacking in this regard, making the flavors quite underwhelming.\nThe rice, a staple in Persian dining, was of low quality. It was pale and utterly tasteless, which was a major letdown. Good quality rice should be fluffy and fragrant, but what was served fell short of these basic expectations. The overall quality of the food was poor. When dining out, especially at a cuisine-specific restaurant like Cazba, one expects a certain level of authenticity and quality, which, regrettably, was not met. It's disappointing to see such a lack of attention to detail and quality in a restaurant that has the potential to offer a rich culinary experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNIUx4MiuyTlwhy5p4lu3D8qhXoTD3kf6_x30lr\u0026fid=0x0:0xc4a5aadb0e7a117c""],""When"":""2024-2-27""}]",

tonight from Dinakis (through skip the dishes). Ordered my regular Greek dish, the chicken souvlaki. I often order from another restaurant but thought I would give Dinakis a try. Upon eating my chicken souvlaki skewer, I noticed the taste and texture of the chicken seemed off. To my surprise the chicken was raw in the middle. The restaurant was immediately called to inform them. They stated that we needed to contact skip for a refund (which is fine!) and said the chicken was raw due to how busy the restaurant was tonight. Unfortunately, I do not see this as a valid reason for serving undercooked meat. They offered to remake the meal and have me come and pick it up. Unfortunately with a baby in bed, leaving the house is not option which is why I ordered in.\n\nI’ll no longer be order from Dinakis.

It's the perfect companion to their delicious offerings.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Souvlaki Combo is a real treat. It comes with beef, chicken, and prawn souvlaki, each one cooked to perfection.

These come with one skewer instead of two at a reduced price, making it great value.

Knowing that my chicken was still relatively crispy after nearly an hour, I imagine it would've tasted spectacular straight out of the fryer. I made dumplings alongside (should've taken a photo before putting the dumplings in, but oh well!). The chicken came with a small side order of pickled radish. I personally LOVE pickled radish so next time I will order a bigger side pickled radish. All in all, definitely some of the best korean fried chicken I've had in Vancouver- highly recommend. Even the boneless chicken tastes amazing!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipONCk_af9v-W-pPAZRamFWWFPIvbpz4lV3BeWwM\u0026fid=0x0:0x464057daf042c093""],""When"":""2021-8-12""},{""Name"":""Nathan Ozee"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX082A1x_wj7AxxsD2GKy5bR5t4BkjbO2P7RKrD-PyQx-wdvkD1=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Radish and drink no longer complimentary with an insane price for half order….\nEvery Korean place had complimentary dishes but greed took over these guys.\n\nIt was previously a complete package.\nno longer complete.

So that's why I really wanted to try it out and leave a review, because I think there's great potential here and I hope they get more business!\n\nI've been here twice now, as of this review, and I think this is the type of spot where they do some dishes well, and others not as much. I often find that to be the case for restaurants with larger menus, not every place can do every dish well, and I think that's understandable! So your experience here could definitely vary depending on what you choose to order. The first time we came we ordered the Kung Pao chicken because another review said they enjoyed it, but we found it to be pretty \""meh\"" and just okay. So the next time we came we ordered a different chicken dish, the General Tsao's Chicken, and we like that one much better! Much better flavour!\n\nOther dishes that we enjoyed were the Xiao Long Bao (a dish Peaceful Restaurant is known for), the Beef Rolls (another dish they're known for), the Spicy Gingered Beef, the Vegetable \u0026 Tofu Stir-fried Noodles, and the Sichuan Stir-fried Noodles. The broth in the Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai soup-filled dumplings) was delicious and went well with the vinegar they serve it with, the vinegar really helps to cut the richness of the broth and pork filling.\n\nThe noodles also had a great texture to them, a nice bounce and chewiness that was satisfying. The Sichuan Stir-fried Noodles were my favourite as they also had a nice light heat to them. I will say that the \""Spicy\"" Gingered Beef isn't very spicy but that may be a good or bad thing depending on who you ask. It's still very tasty regardless of if you're a spice fan or not!\n\nI had family members who visited on a separate occasion from me and they said they wouldn't recommend the fried rice (a category I didn't try on my visits) and that the squid had good flavour but was not crispy enough! So maybe keep those notes in mind when you're deciding what to order!\n\nNow, the ambiance at the restaurant is where I think there could definitely be improvement. It's very clean and quiet in the restaurant, but a little too quiet as there's no music at all! So if you go on a quiet night it's a bit strange having it be so silent. I'd recommend they put some light background music of some kind on and it would be much better.\n\nAlso in terms of ambiance, they don't provide regular eating utensils, but plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates and cups. Yes this does upset me as someone who hates single use waste, but I do understand that they opened during covid and it seems to be very quiet for dine in (at least when we've gone). I suspect that they may also be short staffed, so this might be a way for them to keep costs low and keep workloads manageable with only a few staff members.\n\nI definitely hope in future that they will move toward regular cutlery and plates, but if this would be a deal breaker for your dine-in experience, then I recommend trying take out! I did see quite a few take out orders get picked up so that's definitely an option some customers are choosing, and it makes sense.\n\nAside from the music and dinnerware, the waitress was very friendly and attentive, which we appreciated. Parking is also plentiful so there's no issues there. The price is not bad at all  either, we always get at least another meal or two as leftovers so it's good value! My hope for this place is that it can work toward building a better ambiance and that people will still give it a try as they work toward that transition. I think there's room for improvement but I also think there's definitely some things they're doing well!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP0DwGVQ0f-1evWkGfS9MOh0jP9iL_22siWwZpO\u0026fid=0x0:0x9d1f8426af958dd1""],""When"":""2021-9-23""}]",

So customers can adjust the flavor and spiciness for their noodle.  I like garlic, so I would always add a fairly good portion so the smell would last for a few days in my breath 🤣.  Their bubble tea is surprisingly good too for a non-bubble tea place.  The pearl is chewy.  They also have a flavor we enjoy so much and haven’t been able to find it elsewhere (long yan and dates milk tea).  As there is only one server that also acts as a cashier and the bubble tea maker, don’t expect too much service.  I guess the restaurant made it clear of that when they made a QR code menu for you to order from yourself.  What they should do next is, buy a robot to deliver the food so they don’t even need a server.  Overall we enjoy the place for our noodle fix.

The only silver lining is that there were 3 slices that were okay, but it’s appalling that these slices were even considered for consumption.

In the end, decided on this place since it’s been decade or longer since I have been to this place.\n\nUpon entering, it seems like the interior went through a bit of change and renovation. The place was pretty empty except for 3 booths seated with customers, maybe it was near closing time (1.5hrs before closing). Everything appeared to be clean throughout the restaurant with a comfortable spacing between the tables and booths.\n\nThe service was subpar from the server, maybe she was more focused on cleaning and getting off work. When the owner/ manager took over, it was a lot better and she was more polite.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Sizzling Hot plate combo B+B (chicken steak \u0026 sausages) with borscht soup, spaghetti , cold lemon tea. The chicken was a little dry and the soup was a bit off and warm only. And the hot plate didn’t sizzle at all, maybe a 3 second frisk sound?\n2. Sizzling hot place combo A+B (filet mignon \u0026 deep fried oysters) with lobster bisque, steamed rice, add lobster tail $23 extra. The filet mignon was horrible, first time ever struggling to chew a filet mignon, it was dry and didn’t taste fresh. The oysters were little midgets. The steamed rice was more like overnight rice just added a bit of water and a quick heat up by the microwave, it was dry and hard. And lastly the lobster tail was horrible; it had that bad fishy taste to it, one tiny bite from that and had to stop cause not worth food poisoning myself from it. And once again the sizzling plate wasn’t even warm!! (Facepalm) The only thing okay was the lobster bisque.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed with the food. I don’t remember it being this bad? What happened? Closer to closing time and whoever the cook in the kitchen was didn’t give 2 cents about the food being served? Is it really that hard to hire a decent cook nowadays after the pandemic? And for crying out loud, it only takes 30 seconds to heat up the iron plates and how can one pawn off such a bad bowl of rice in a Chinese restaurant? I honestly would send this cook packing for retirement if working for me, definitely wouldn’t tolerate this kind of bs jeopardizing my business.\n\nI guess I retained my good nature and composure by taking into consideration that the owner/manager was very polite and friendly; very poise and elegant with the services.

If you become a member, which costs $15 per year, you can enjoy a 10% discount on all orders, which is a great deal.\n\nOne of the highlights of Copa Cafe is their breakfast menu, which boasts generous portions that won't hurt your wallet despite the current high prices. On my recent visit, I opted for the satay beef noodle and shared the cheese, spinach, and bacon omelette with my husband. We also ordered two cups of their famous Hong Kong-style milk tea. After applying the 10% membership discount, our bill was a reasonable $23 with the tip included.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with both the quality and quantity of our breakfast. The flavors were satisfactory, and the portions were generous. Copa Cafe is a must-visit spot for anyone who loves Hong Kong-style cuisine and wants to try something new.

But every body knows, in our modern times, this equation is quite impossible in big cities because of the cost and profit concerns.\n\nBut in this pizza shop they nearly got the perfect combination.\n\nThey have a real stove oven at the right temperature, good quality ingredients and handmade authentic dough.\n\nBoth pizza and Foccacia are nicely crusty and juicy. The Tomato sauce is not bitter nor too sweet, just yummy and fresh  ;-).\n\nToppings and mozzarella have a very good price to quality ratio.\n\nAll the ingredients are really really fresh 👍\n\nA suggestion for them, I think you should make a pizza with different ingredients which are hard to find in PoCo\n\nAnd for me the most important thing , people in this pizza shop are really happy, hospitable, positive and energetic. They really smile to you because they just want to. The total vibe is just like the warm and welcoming family owned pizza shops in Italy too 😍😍.\n\nPs: I asked the owner to tour the kitchen because of my cleanliness obsession.

With its diverse menu, commitment to quality, and friendly service, it’s a standout option that’s well worth a visit. Whether you’re a regular mall-goer or just passing through, Doni offers a delicious escape from the usual fast food fare. Highly recommended!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMs9cNGsHAmSchoBQxjUsrv8agGYTMoI2S--hcg\u0026fid=0x0:0x5cd9b26c7b81a50a""],""When"":""2024-9-24""},{""Name"":""Daniel Jung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFE7g6vnjf23CW6mDeh4anchF8fxBs6O5Nsx0bvhepuO3MVzWa=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Update: Half \u0026 Half Dumplings are spot on, and the Seafood fried rice was delicious with a generous portion!

Intrigued by the positive reviews, I decided to visit during a weekday at off-peak hours, shortly after 3 PM.\n\nI ordered the spicy pork cutlet, and it did not disappoint. The batter and pork thickness were excellent, and the dish was well-executed. Although the sauce was flavorful and creamy, it wasn't the typical accompaniment for Korean pork cutlets and was spicier than I expected. I didn't quite like the sauce tbh.\n\nHowever, I loved the texture and the flavour of the rice, and the sliced cabbage was fresh. Next time, I would opt for the non-spicy version, though I couldn't find it on the menu this time.\n\nLocated on the 2nd floor of Henderson Mall's food court, the area was clean and well-maintained. Like many Korean restaurants, Doni uses a small remote that rings and buzzes when your order is ready. The employee was kind, and the ordering process was smooth.\n\nSome have complained about long wait times for their orders. Despite there being few customers, my order took about 10-15 minutes, which suggests they fry the cutlet fresh upon ordering. Otherwise, the wait time wouldn't make sense.\n\nConsidering the inflated food prices elsewhere, Doni is very affordable. I'm definitely returning to try their Korean-Chinese menu items and dumplings.

Glad to see it's still here and I'm visiting again after 20+ years. All I remember was that I liked their hot and sour soup.\n\nNot really an authentic Szechuan restaurant. 30 years ago, most chinese cuisines were cooked by hong kongers or south chinese people. So, most of these dishes are going to be a southern take on it.\n\nHot and sour soup - price is awesome. $11 enough for at least 6 bowls. Souo base is missing a bit of flavor but it is jam packed with ingredients.\n\nDrunken chicken - it was ok. Little on the salty side.\n\nShanghainese pan fried pork buns - these were probably the worst I've had. Not made in house and not properly pan fried. No juice, super dry, no fried bottom crust.\n\nBean curd wrapped pork dim sum - surprisingly this came out last. At least 20 min has passed. This is a steamed dish but it came out with dried edges like it was sitting on a dry heater. Taste was ok.\n\nMapo tofu - asked for extra spicy and extra numbing. Numbing was there but nowhere near real szechuan numbing. Was not spicy at all. Sauce was more oily than saucey.\n\nThe price point reflects the quality. Things are either mediocre or a complete miss. Would come again to try only the better stuff. Staff was friendly. Came to try to refill the tea way more times than normal.

This time, we were seated at the booked bench seats, which were comfortable and offered a good view of the restaurant’s charming blend of traditional Japanese ambiance and modern design touches..\n\nOne of the standout features of Kisso Sushi is their use of technology. Each table is equipped with a tablet, making the ordering process incredibly convenient. Whether you need to place an order or request service, it can all be done through the tablet.\n\nAfter placing our orders, we had the unique experience of having our dishes delivered by a robotic server. It was quite a novelty and added a fun element to our meal. As for the food, it did not disappoint. The dishes were delicious, and the portions were generous.\n\nIn summary, Kisso Sushi provided us with a delightful dining experience for Father's Day. The combination of tasty food, substantial portions, and efficient service, all set in a beautifully designed space, ensures we'll be back for more.

The excellent reviews drew us in for a late lunch, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I ordered the miso ramen, which had a generous portion and was a fantastic deal. However, the beef tataki, while decent, could have been fresher and a bit more substantial for $17.\n\nOne standout for me was the Japanese black lager—it was hands down one of the best beers I’ve ever tasted.

It is somewhere between the Neapolitan thin-ness and like a “standard pizza”. Best of both worlds.\n\nToppings were not too heavy but I think there is pizza science out there with a toppings to crust ratio. If you want a stack of toppings add more.\n\nCheese was light but again I think this is purposeful and it works with the rest of it, but if you need to live the cheezy life, just add more of it.\n\nI was very annoying by accident and I made a few special requests while it was busy on a Friday not knowing this place is actually quite popular and busy. They accommodated my requests anyway.\n\nOnline ordering was easy and the timeline was reliable. I waited maybe 2 extra minutes (probably while the accommodated my annoying peak hour requests)\n\nThe staff were nice.\n\nIt is August and it was hot.

Finally decided for a revisit to this place which I haven’t been to for years.\n\nInside is one of those smaller cozy place; clean, typical and nothing too fancy. I was glad the server seated me on a bigger table instead one of those midget size ones. The server informed me they have a Tri-city special set menu for $35, quick glanced and I opted out on that. Here were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Miso soup (complimentary). Pretty basic but thank you, nice to have a hot soup to warm up to from the cold.\n2. Appetizer tempura. Pretty basic and as it should be.\n3. Oyster motoyaki. I was glad they were on the shell but didn’t know it’s their own version of it; cold, marinated with cold pan fried onions on top. The cold oysters didn’t really do it for me. Is it really that hard to find just the basic fresh oyster motoyaki baked with Japanese mayo anywhere? lol\n4. Foie gras nigiri. Okay this is one of those must order item from here. Loved how the way it is put together and seared. Rich, buttery and creamy that literally melts in your mouth. Very nice!\n5. Spider roll. A little bit too basic, could be more generous on the soft shell crab.\n6. Saba shio yaki. It was okay, pretty straightforward dish.\n7. Assorted sashimi. It was okay, the Akami could be a better cut.\n8. Chopped scallops, uni, amaebi nigiris. The chopped scallop was fresh, the uni was a generous amount, I like how the amaebi head was prepared so easier to eat.\n9. Albacore toro, Akami, chu toro. The albacore toro was a bit dry, the Akami was fresh, the chu toro just make it to the satisfactory level (as you can tell it lost some of its beautiful colour already).\n\nThe restaurant is conveniently located on the corner of Lougheed Hwy and Shaughnessy Street in Port Coquitlam. There are plenty of free parkings in the plaza. Inside the restaurant offers a causal comfortable dining atmosphere.\n\nThe food was okay, could be better in some departments, but overall satisfactory level.\n\nAs for the service, the staffs here were very friendly and welcoming.

An absolute A+ to Chef Keith and Chika for their mastery of perfecting a great omakase experience in the tricities.\n\nThey are reservations only (and for a good reason!) and this can be done on their new online portal!! by controlling the number of seatings, Chef K and Chika are able to interact and share their craft with patrons in an intimate and personal way. There is no hustle and bustle or fakeness that would otherwise follow some restaurant vibes. There is purely passion for fish, customer service and, of course, metal music! I urge you to dine at the chefs bar and let Chef K tell you his extensive and wonderful background from catering some A list bands, to being on tour, and changing restaurant models all while being fed an amazing feast.\n\nThe fish is sourced from Japan and screams quality and flavour. He knows exactly what he’s doing with all the fish profiles and pairing them with a variety of notes like shiso, yuzu and ginger. Between the 14 unbelievably mouth watering and satisfying dishes, Chef K and Chika’s kindness shared the spotlight easily. Humble beginnings have led to an extraordinary and legendary journey for SKK. Some of the special highlights were the blue fin tuna, South American jumbo prawn, Spanish mackerel and the scallops.\n\nI cannot wait to bring my omakase/metal loving friends and family here to join in on the greatness because sharing truly is caring and this gem is too awesome to keep to myself!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOUQxTRcdVg6w2fRGNA2rgJ11LTUVbZ-4-9zpj2\u0026fid=0x0:0x6cd92fe57d09de1d""],""When"":""2024-6-10""},{""Name"":""RT Q."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJFlx26VZcmF0Oz0NMLS20j-RG2uk3E1hU454Spnz4JmPX1cA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""🤤: finally leaving a long overdue review for this hidden-gem in the Tri-Cities area. quite affordable omakase options without sacrificing quality. we’ve been here multiple times and it never disappoints.

Want a simple question answered? Be prepared to wait ages for a response, and when they finally do get back to you, it's with a dismissive attitude, as if you're bothering them by just being there.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the portions. They are **pathetically inadequate**. You pay a decent price expecting a filling meal, but what you get is a sad, skimpy plate of food that wouldn’t satisfy a toddler. I have no idea how they justify the cost when you’re left still hungry after what should be a satisfying meal.\n\nAs if the service and food weren't bad enough, the **clientele is downright trashy**. I’ve never seen such an unrefined crowd in one place. It's like the people who frequent this restaurant have no concept of basic manners or hygiene. The atmosphere feels more like a rowdy dive bar than a place you’d actually want to enjoy a meal.\n\nOverall, Sun Mongolian BBQ is a **complete and total failure** in every aspect—service, food, atmosphere.

Quality of ingredients seem low, we are vegetarian/vegan but our table ate a lot of meat and the quality of cuts was very low, the brussel sprouts were tasty but low quality sprouts for sure. Just ingredients seem on the lower end. Also this comment is from my gf (give vegans a carb and they will drink more). The jackfruit vegan dish was literally nothing else but a plate of jackfruit which is pretty close to no calories (don't order this, waste of money). A bun jackfruit sandwich would suffice way better. Service was ok not great. The tofu bites were incredible through and through. Oh dishes are very small don't come hungry.

Hawaiian roll with the deep fried garlic and ponzu sauce was just the perfect roll, also a must get. Godzilla roll was very much like the roll’s name and was so delicious! Such a bang for your buck.

It took almost 30 mins for our food to come and sadly, two customers that arrived and ordered after us, received their food before us. All that aside, the sandwiches was what I was most excited to try. We ordered a beef and a chicken Shish taouk. The beef was quite smelly and I believe they cooked the chicken on the same flat top as the beef, and it smelled similar. Very small portion sizes for the price. The side of fries were also NOT authentic, they were Costco fries. We also ordered an appetizer of falafel, which was just ok.

We ended up ordering the family grill platter with assorted meats from the menu and it  was some of the driest meat that I have ever had.  The lamb, the chicken and beef were all dry and most of all flavorless.  The kunefe was OK and not the best.  The only thing that i could say was enjoyable was the bread and lentile soup.

The dust and hair stick to it, so disgusting.\n\nThey make their drinks that needs blender right by my ears, so every 5 minutes there was this super loud noise that was unbearable, we couldn’t talk or hear each other. I left the restaurant with a very bad headache. I took some videos so you can actually hear how loud it is. Normally these equipments belong to the kitchen, no one enjoys hearing ear drilling noise like that while they’re eating food that they didn’t pay cheap money for. I really hope they change this. I was holding my ears not to hear it and still left with a bad migraine.\nThey were doing their cutlery preparation right by our table that was banging the spoons and forks the rest of the time that was no blender going on. The servants had to go in and out and hit us or our chairs all the time. Overall DON’T SIT BY THE BAR.\n\nI think 2 starts is very generous of me.

This is a no frills, reminds me of my childhood Chinese restaurant my Chinese Nana used to take us to. The portions are large, the food is delicious \u0026 the service is friendly.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nPORK Turnover (aka footballs). This is a must order in our family \u0026 I daresay these are some of the best ones we have ever had. Where most places offer 3/serving, here they do 4. They were good sized, non greasy, crispy on the outside, soft \u0026 chewy on the inside \u0026  it was full of delicious pork \u0026 mushroom filling.\n\nEggplant w/Shrimp Paste (a customer favourite we're told) \u0026 I can see why. The serving came with 3 large pieces that were each cut in half easily making 6 servings. The sauce beautifully complemented the dish without overpowering the shrimp \u0026 eggplant.\n\nPan-Fried Rice Rolls with Sauces. This for me is comfort food. I love the simplicity \u0026 soft chewy texture of the rice rolls \u0026 how they pair perfectly with the slightly sweet \u0026 salty sauces.\n\nBeef Balls. If I had not had beef balls before I would say these were quite good. However, it being a staple on our dim sum table, this one was a little bit of a miss for me. I can't quite put my finger on it as I said they were quite good. I guess they're just a bit different than what I'm used to.\n\nThey also have a bakery attached \u0026 between the restaurant, bakery \u0026 takeout this place was busy!\n\nThey do recommend reservations for large parties \u0026 did I mention they have ALL DAY DIM SUM!!! Yes you read that right! They also do set menus \u0026 they highly recommend checking them out during King Crab season....I think we might just take them up on that. Actually we can't wait to go back \u0026 try all their other dishes so I'm sure we'll be back much sooner. We even loaded up on some of their bakery items to have later!\n\nIf you're in the Coquitlam area (even if you're not) \u0026 are looking for great authentic Chinese food, please check them out!

I’ve been looking for authentic Chinese food restaurant like this in Coquitlam especially with spicy cuisine but also the typical noodles, dumplings, etc… I was told the chef is from more northern China and the lady helped us is from Guang Dong and they have been in the restaurant business for decades, I didn’t ask too much about their stories but all I know is this is their newest adventure! I am glad!!!! I see people order for take outs and some people even order everyday but from 7:15 to 9:30 on a Saturday, there were only 4 dine in tables including us, so they do not have extra servers, which is totally understandable… therefore if you are looking for services like cactus club, it’s not going to happen any time soon… nonetheless, I rate the service 10/10 for their friendliness and knowledge of the food, suggestions, the only reason why I give 4 star on google is because I want to stay true to what to expect for the next customers, atmosphere is 3/5 because it is a little dated but to some people this could be a 5/5.. nostalgic feeling!

This cozy spot has been around forever, quietly serving up some of the most delicious homemade soups and sandwiches you’ll find anywhere. The owners, an older couple with a genuine love for food and people, bring such a warm, personal touch to every visit—it feels like stepping into a friend’s kitchen.\n\nTheir menu is simple but so satisfying, with fresh ingredients and flavors that taste like home. Whether you’re craving a hearty soup on a cold day or a made-to-order sandwich packed with goodness, this place never disappoints. Just a heads-up—they only accept cash and debit, but trust me, it’s well worth it. Also parking is a downer… might need to park elsewhere and walk ✌️\n\nIf you’re in the area and haven’t discovered Soup Plus yet, do yourself a favor and stop by.

The menu's focus on meats was clear, yet a greater presence of vegetables would have been welcome, as we only stumbled upon the option for a salad after noticing another table enjoying one. Another quirk was the timing of the soup service, arriving unexpectedly at the end of our meal rather than at the beginning, well after all other dishes were served.

There is also an indoor parking lot nearby, so you can park your car and walk there within 1 minute. If you don't know what to order, I highly recommend trying the pan-fried dumplings (item A7) on the menu. It's worth driving for half an hour just to have those. The second recommendation is the steamed soup dumplings (item A1).

Initially rated 5 stars, but it’s now decreased to 3. The prices have been raised, and I’ve noticed another increase again between January 25th and February 23rd. Paying $18 for a panang curry of this size (its additional $5 for rice, $23 in total) feels too expensive, and unfortunately, my tofu tasted expired. This restaurant used to be my favorite, but the decline in freshness and the price hikes leave me disappointed.\n\nOld review, Nov 2022:\nIncredible Vegetable Panang Curry!

We were a large group and got a variety of items like the vegan and chicken khao suey, panang curry, green thai curry, papaya salad. Everything was very delicious, very well plated and very good quantities too. The server seemed like the owner of the store who was also helping prepare the meals.

Flavourful, good portion, fluffy rice and just enough spice.\n\nThe plain gimbop I ordered as a side wasn't mushy like last time and it was flavourful. I think the only thing missing was the sesame seeds but that is just for decoration. I'm happy that the quality of rice actually met my expectation.\n\nI can recommend TOKKi to others with confidence, I'll visit again and try different menu in the near future.\n\n===== Original Review =====\n\nHad a high expectation after hearing good things about this restaurant from Korean communities and 4.2 Google review.\nI would give 3.7/5.\n\nVisited this place after the lunch hour, so the food court was pretty much empty. The cashier was kind, prompt, and professional. Food came out fast. I really like the 'buzzer' to let you know when the order is ready.\n\nLet's talk about the food.\n\nThe rice in Gimbop (김밥) was slightly mushy and not salted enough. This reminded me of my mom making Gimbop for me when I was a kid. She always wanted to take the 'healthier' choice, so she put minimal salt, no MSG and used mushy rice for better digestion. The last time I asked mom to make Gimbop was probably 20 years ago or something :p... I always said NO or had to ask her to make it extra++ fluffy - then she makes rice that I like.\n\nI'll still try their tuna/pork cutlet Gimbops.\nMany Gimbop/Ddubokki restaurants in Korea make flavored Gimbops super delicious while leaving their original to taste like meh.\n\nThe Ddukbokki (떡볶이) was interesting. Maybe they use anchovy-based broth? It's definitely not my favourite flavour, but I do remember some traditional Ddukbokki places in Korea with such a taste.\nBoth the rice cakes and the fishcakes had great texture.\nMy honest opinion would be 3.7/5. Maybe some of my friends or my parents might like this.\n\nThe fried squid was pretty good. Decent portion, and the batter wasn't soggy. However, it wasn't crispy either. I always dip these fried items in Ddukbokki sauce and thus all deep fried items need to be extra crispy. If Tokki can make it crispier, it'll be a killer item for sure. Unfortunately, it doesn't have that magic texture yet.\n4/5.\n\nOverall, the flavor is rather traditional than what you would normally expect in Korea in 2023. I'm more used to sweet/spicy/clean broth/full of MSG flavour when it comes to Ddubokki.\n\nI see a huge potential but some improvements would easily put them 4.5/5 restaurant."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPEuORF2JfYA0K6KvLPnx_jyFApjXWB3K6xx8qo\u0026fid=0x0:0xc4d0a3f8d7b70dc7""],""When"":""2023-10-9""},{""Name"":""Daniel Jung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFE7g6vnjf23CW6mDeh4anchF8fxBs6O5Nsx0bvhepuO3MVzWa=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Kind and friendly service.

The inari (sweet tofu) rice rolls remind me of the rolls my mom used to make when I was a little kid.

I even loved the scrambled egg, which I was on the fence about at first. They torch the inari slightly on the outside, so it has a nice smokey flavour 🤤\n\nThe staff are SUPER friendly. My friend and I talked about how we would come back just for the service.

The meals are nothing fancy for $8.99 and $7.99, but as diners who visit IKEA once a year, the food has a nostalgic and comforting feel. The mashed potatoes were creamy, and the different balls had good flavour. I was a big fan of their vegan chocolate torte, which was rich and decadent without the use of eggs and gluten! I'd definitely order this again, and appreciate the vegan dessert option! Water is self-serve by the other beverages and is complimentary.\n\nWe unknowingly went on Swe-dish Thursdays, so it was packed for the lunch hour with many families in line for food. There was a bit of a wait, but the line moves quickly (finding seating is another question, but we were fortunate to find a table soon after paying). I was looking forward to having their Veggie Balls, but had to settle for the Plant Balls as they weren't serving the Veggie Balls on their menu.\n\nThe only minor issue we had was when we were paying full price (because we weren't IKEA Family Members). We were happy to pay full price because we were unaware of the Thursday special and were not signed up for membership, but the cashier had insisted we keep the receipt as they said we'd be able to get a partial refund on that food bill if we became IKEA Family Members at a later date. While we were eating, we signed up for membership, but another staffer in the restaurant area said we could only use it for future meal savings and couldn't get the refund. It wasn't a big issue for us, but we were left questioning why the cashier was insistent about a refund as we hadn't asked for one in the first place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMKuqoOjwtD_cF8WJfhhDxkulxgeMyJ_DngE1Xd\u0026fid=0x0:0x59278ff7cf09cddf""],""When"":""2024-8-3""},{""Name"":""eddy wong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8Fjpj3y8teHQ4LqbC4PHR8whbU4-XOrTXEwklI9bGRqZLRD20=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Friday Friday Friday only this Black Friday!

Great choice of ingredients that are always fresh, a solid lineup of sauces and interesting signature bowls. It took me a while to try, but pokerrito wrap has all rights to be a form of serving poke.

Quantity wise it was great the portion was massive. The different kinds of seafood, octopus, squid and shrimp really complimented the noodles.\n\nThe sweet and sour deep fried pork was also really good. It wasn’t overly greasy or soft, had a nice crunch on the outside and went well with a tangy sauce.\n\nThe fried chicken was good. A bit spicy but really solid. Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and a nice mildly spicy tangy sauce to it with plenty of vegetables and onions. It was delightful.\n\nThe real star was the cream saewoo shrimp. They were giant, and the sweet mayonnaise drizzle to it was pleasant.\n\nOverall, I would say that this place has better eats than most of the Korean spots around North road. Nice small location, cozy feeling to the place and the excellent portion sizes really make this a place I would return to and try other dishes at!

To top it off, at 10:20 pm, the server abruptly rushed us for the bill, even though the restaurant was supposed to close at 11:30 pm. When my friend chose not to leave a tip and selected the no-tip option on the payment machine, the server rudely informed us that tip was not included and repeatedly canceled the transaction and tried to force us to leave her a tip. As for the food, we ordered the raw crab, beef tartar bowl, bulgogi bowl, and clam bowl. The only dish worth noting was the beef tartar bowl; the rest of the items were disappointing.

Both were distinct-tasting gourmet burgers with their merits. I must admit that I’m partial to In-N-Out burgers, but these belong to a different category of food. Gordon Ramsay’s burgers are good in their own way. The 24-Hour burger’s Bbq sauce kept this dish interesting imo, while the Hell’s Kitchen burger was not so-in-your-face, as its subtle flavors from its ingredients kept this a pleasant dish to enjoy through a chat. For our drinks, the Espresso Martini tasted like a chocolatey dessert and the Earl and the Empress was like an iced tea punch. Both were good enough drinks to pair with our burgers.\n\nAll in all, it’s at least worth a visit to try out the menu, but the price points may not be as appealing if you’re looking for heft or more generous serving sizes."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOq1McavZOXafsAfIX0lQP4i5lEYxGu3gUPU0jm\u0026fid=0x0:0x949c4608707b7a90""],""When"":""2024-12-1""},{""Name"":""George Watson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWDDOfxretD35ARsdREF1AzgD2ndrlNCvaeJvYRp_CvcKbsfn0=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I’d come here just for the onion rings!

Their bread is what I think makes their sandwiches taste so great (I’m a sourdough fan myself). It’s not your typical grocery-store bought bread, and it plays a huge role in the flavor factor.\nI was inclined to get the soup since a lot of the other customers at the time were getting them, and I can see why. It tastes homemade and fresh, which makes me consider trying all their soups.\nThey also serve daily specials like chicken teriyaki with rice which I also enjoyed. The portion was generous for the price, and the chicken was crispy which made it much more enjoyable than the typical soft/mushy chicken teriyaki from other places.\nThis café is in a secluded area and it’s one of the healthier available options for breakfast/lunch. It’s also nice to see how the staffs here know their regulars’ names and usual orders. This to me means that they are tasty enough to come back!

Whether with my family or just the two of us, we’ve enjoyed countless breakfasts here, including many Mother’s Day and Father’s Day celebrations. The restaurant's modern design and simplicity create an upscale breakfast experience, even though it maintains a casual and welcoming vibe.\n\nSeating is limited, and I still recall waiting outside with social distancing protocols in place during the early post-COVID days. Last week, we visited again, and as always, I ordered my favorite: chicken waffles with whipped cream and strawberry topping on the side. My wife, on the other hand, loves trying something different every time we visit. The food arrived quickly, and as usual, it was very tasty.\n\nHowever, (our visit on Nov 30th)  I do want to share one piece of feedback from this visit. My wife and I were enjoying our coffee after finishing our meal when the server brought the check—completely understandable, especially when tables need to turn over for waiting guests. But this time, there were four empty tables, and no one was waiting. Moments later, while we were still sipping our coffee, the server returned with the cordless payment unit and stood by our table. We were both caught off guard, thinking, “What…?” We paid because the payment unit was already there, and the server was waiting, but the interaction felt rushed.\n\nHaving owned a restaurant in downtown Vancouver, I understand the need to turn tables efficiently. That said, there’s an unspoken etiquette between servers and guests, and this instance felt a bit abrupt—particularly since the restaurant wasn’t busy.  It’s a small issue, and I’m sure it wasn’t intentional, but I wanted to share this experience in the hopes it’s not repeated for other guests.\n\nOf course, we will continue visiting Big Flat Pancake because we love the food, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is just some constructive feedback for management or ownership to consider.\n\nThank you, and see you again soon!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN3DgZTp8jMRgeo2EOBKceMPW-1SSt0lYSYOwaO\u0026fid=0x0:0xaaebff47a4a99ef2""],""When"":""2024-12-10""}]",

It was great. Westwood Plateau is literally in the mountains of Coquitlam and the views are amazing. The holes are challenging too. The neat thing is one can choose from a variety of tees. A top pro can choose the back tees at about 6800 yards whereas a newbie can choose the forward tees at about 5000 yards. I went with the middle tees. The conditioning of the course was pretty good for April. A little wet but we played the “preferred lies rule.” They have a super amount of sand bunkers. Unfortunately there were a lot of stones in those bunkers which have to be dealt with. Actually, do you know what the solution is? Don’t hit into them 🤣. There is a hitting cage to warm up but if you want to practice, you’ll have to do that at Westwood’s driving range and Executive course a mile or two away.

Long wait times for pick-up, even on weeknights.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I was particularly disheartened by the lack of freshness and variety in the vegetarian options. The few offerings they have seem like an afterthought, and none of them come close to what Pizza1 used to serve.\n\nOn top of that, the customer service is was very bad, I’ve noticed this on several visits when placing an order by phone and picking up my order,\n\nI can’t recommend this place in its current state.

If you've never been here before, the way to order is by self-service touchscreen stations they have on the left side of the counter. We're so used to just ordering to the staff and completely missed the touchscreen stations 😆.\n\nOne thing this ramen place has it going is the noodle. They're perfectly cooked with a nice bite and chew to them. You can choose between pork-based or chicken-based broth. We both chose pork-based since we like to base things on traditional first when trying new places. The pork-based is very thick and  creamy. If you're a fan of those really thick and creamy ramen, this place is for you. For us, while we like rich broth, this one is more on the too thick and too rich side of things. I also find for the TanTan ramen, that the broth is too much on the salty side of things. My husband got the chashu ramen and the salt level is much better, just right. Maybe we should've gone with the chicken-based broth instead...\n\nAvg price is somewhere between $13-14/ bowl. You can make it a combo and pick 1 small side dish like gyoza, karaage or donburi, etc. Drinks not included in combo. So for 2 people, if you order 2 combos, expect to pay somewhere along the line of $40 or so. Price-wise, I feel like you can have a better ramen at a sit-down restaurant. You might be paying a little more, but not THAT much more."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOScIYJALBSiF24q2-KcOHh_ChTNlQ-S70oyD2K\u0026fid=0x0:0x9a7fc6ef7ee65139""],""When"":""2022-7-29""},{""Name"":""Alex Barros"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLbGQfDFyWBFf-SHj8dHqz7fJQ6yDYj9me5-vlKbsRH7vrJMA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""The noodles in the Ramen has a strange chemical  smell.
