lovely waterfront view, creating a pleasant atmosphere for dining. The ingredients are fresh, and the service is attentive. The seafood chowder was rich and flavorful, brimming with fresh seafood that complemented the creamy base perfectly. The grilled ahi tuna was cooked to perfection, with a nice sear on the outside while remaining tender and juicy inside. However, the menu selection is quite limited, which may not satisfy those seeking variety. The prices are more in line with fine dining, though the food and service quality feel average for the cost.

Tables are lovely with white linens, restaurant is spacious with patio seating as well. Nice views of water, mountains and the Rocky Point Park. Food was average in terms of presentation and flavour profile. Calamari was too thinly sliced with overly sweet sauce, acidity was somewhat lacking. Wedge Caesar salad was not appealing, insufficient dressing. Mixed grill seafood with zucchini and carrots: you can elevate this dish by using asparagus and baby carrots instead, and with a few microgreens garnish. Trust me, it’ll make a difference! We concluded our meal with coffee and dessert. Molten chocolate lava cake could’ve been better if there’s a garnish, just a piece of raspberry or blackberry or half strawberry, that would really make a big difference! After our lunch, we strolled at the Rocky Point Park which is just a steps away from the restaurant.

We sat at the patio, the server kept chasing us for ordering food. She came to chase us at least 3 times in about 5mins. No patience at all.\n\nWe have spent about $190 in total. The food portion was very small, especially the seafood tower and steak. The lobster tail was spongy, no taste, not fresh at all. Oyster and mussel were tiny. What’s worst was, all food came to the table almost at the same time. The table was full and we couldn’t enjoy the food one by one. The food was cold, not enjoyable at all.\n\nIt was a birthday celebration. I remarked it when I made the reservation online and reconfirmed again with a phone call. It was expecting to have a complementary desert to surprise my loved one but turned out nothing at the end. It made me very disappointed and upset. I totally regretted to choose this restaurant.\n\nAfter the dinner, I went to the disabled washroom with my little kids for more space. It was totally disgusting. The floor was wet, hand towel paper and toilet paper were on the floor. It was even worst than a public washroom at the park.\n\nI was not willing to pay the tips at all but still paid a bit. I cried out after the dinner and tried to find out the email address to express my feelings after the dinner. I then found out the cost of the kids meal should be $0.99 during Sep 2-30. Why the server still charged me the regular price?? It was kind of cheating.\n\nTotally not recommend to anyone.\n\n————-\n\nI have already sent email to the restaurant on Sep 2 but nobody follow up."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN1V2FVfLLXo-n6x-sL5vigxsoYa-5GcikyCY94\u0026fid=0x0:0x5aa213bcccc48530""],""When"":""2024-9-4""},{""Name"":""J Q"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWWLFaR2htiLNLIQAXB2-FbuNystyoB794RiAm0Uo82lJgg8OdK=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Everything we tried was very enjoyable, and the fries were especially delicious.

The signature seafood chowder was rich and packed with seafood flavor.\n\nThe seafood boil was abundant with fresh seafood, and while the flavor was mild, a dash of salt or Tabasco balanced it nicely. Though listed as an entree, the portion size was great for sharing.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive, adding to the experience.

We sampled several pasta dishes, and all were exceptional. Oysters are very reasonably priced, which is always a nice bonus.

Even the Number Stands were dirty (see pic.)\nWhy are there Number Stands in a restaurant anyhow? Did I by accident walk into a food court?\nMoving on.....\n\nThe pita bread that comes with the appetizers was hours from having gone bad....I mean..the mold had packed its bags and on its way to us ....quick.\nTo call what they called \""Kashk e Bademjaan\"" is an insult to the dish...it was more like canned goo...enough said.\n\nThe \""Tahdig Mix with Gheyme and Ghormeh sabzi\"" was an absolute disaster.\nThe \""Tahdig\"" was one layer of pita bread dipped in 3 gallons of cheap oil. The \""Ghormeh Sabzi\"" was mostly red beans and the \""Gheymeh\"" was mostly just lentils and tomato paste.  Honestly, I don't even know how to put it into words....and that rarely happens with me.\nMoving onto the Mains.......\n\nThe \""Loghmeh\"" was so tough that I jus stopped eating. It was so dry it was hard to swallow and unseasoned on top of everything. Why didn't I mention anything to the servers? Well...let's just say I knew that I would've been received with a combination of ignorance and indifference.\nThat was the vibe of the servers in general.\n\nThe Lamb Shank was covered with fat that is supposed to be removed with this dish. So, there is just blubbering fat covering 1/3 of your plate, instead of tender lean lamb meat on the bone. The dill rice was overcooked and all of it was unsalted and unseasoned.\n\nWe asked for Coke 0 and got Diet Coke. No glass served. No ice served.\nMoving onto the desert. We thought maybe their desert will at least finish with a positive note.\nThey had 1. Bakhlava. If you serve their Bakhlava to either a Turk, a Persian or a Greek.\nThey will throw it at you. It was not Bakhlava. It was old, off-base, and an insult to this delicious middle eastern/mediterranean desert. Sad.\n\nThe atmosphere felt and looked cold, detached, bare and neglected.\nNeglected of attention, care and love for business.\nAnd boy did it show!\n\nHonestly, as someone who loves dining out, who classifies customer service not be only crucial but an art, and as someone who has been fortunate to know good food and drink.\nThis is the first time I have felt disgust.

However, the star of the show, the margarita pizza, unfortunately fell short of expectations. It lacked the crispness we hoped for, and the sparse basil leaf placement provided a comedic touch.

Thankfully the musicians were entertaining so that was good. It looks like there is an effort being made to make the place fun and inviting but it needs some tweaks, in my opinion.\nEDIT: In response to the manager's reply I want to say that \""advertise\"" regarding the pizza was a poor word choice so my bad. What I meant was the toppings in the menu description. I don't recall seeing the word Neopolitan on either the table or wall menu or the website. From reading other reviews about the pizza, I think adding Neapolitan would be helpful to manage customer's expectations. And suggesting I go to Fresh Slice for a loaded pizza felt like a dig.

I've seen other reviewers unhappy with their food portion size too.\n\nMy wife was happy with her tuna salad portion size though.

Originally a bit of a wait since we didn’t have a reservation, but the host walked out 5 minutes later and knocked on our car door in the rain to let us know they had a cancellation and could seat us right away. Our server was very attentive, though it did start to feel like we were rushed (maybe they had other reservations coming in and didn’t want us to overstay).\n\nWe ordered the Spicy Margarita and the Mexican Mule to start since the drink reviews were strong. Was very nice to see the tequila options were good and they weren’t just using Sauza. We both asked for Maestro Dobel tequila with our drinks and they didn’t disappoint.\n\nWe started with chips and salsa because I always measure quality and authenticity based on the quality of the in-house salsa. The flavour was okay, but likely would be better if it had sat for a bit to allow the flavours to seep throughout. Most of the chips were stale, which didn’t help.\n\nThen tried the queso fundido which was disappointing. Seemed to be mozzarella cheese with no added flavour and ok chorizo.\n\nThen we shared the enchiladas with salsa verde. The shredded chicken lacked flavour and there was feta cheese on top (Greek cheese, not Mexican).\n\nTo anyone else’s standards this would be good quality, however I readily admit my standards are high.

They were all delicious, in fact it was difficult to choose a favorite because they were so distinct from each other. Out of the 3 flavours we tasted, the Black Pepper was the most basic with a great crunch, whereas the Gangnam was the most complex with a beautiful sauce that softened the crispy coating. The Red Chak Chak was good too, with a hearty bite of heat, but like the others, not at all greasy or oily, nor too salty.\nIn addition, the side of french fries were good, especially the light seasoning and complimentary dipping sauce. But if I had any complaint, the french fries were a little over-priced ($7), which is the cheapest option of the potato fry options, so I think we’ll make our own next time.\nNevertheless, We have a new Go-To for fried chicken, with many more flavours to try out!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNhHQxF-1DYeHpMQIoXpNKu964mb3UXJikfj1wo\u0026fid=0x0:0xd72e6e0b02310cc""],""When"":""2022-2-17""}]",

We were so excited to try it out due to their high ratings online. The atmosphere and set up I found was super cute and a great addition to the take out food.\n\nFirst thing we noticed was that even though we were the only ones there , it took them over 25 mins to prepare our burgers and fries. I ordered the bacon and Brie burger and the bacon was very tough to chew. I had to take it out of the burger completely. My friend ordered the Smokey bbq glaze burger. But I wouldn’t say it had any “Smokey”ness to it. Aswell our burger patties were dry and had zero taste. We were a little disappointed about both burgers ..it just didn’t seem very fresh or flavourful. Their signature sauce was very tasty though , and was a nice touch to both burgers.\nWe also ordered truffle fries which was probably the most disappointing. It barely had any cheese ( see photo below ) was cold, and barely had any truffle taste to it. For 12$ I would say it is absolutely not worth buying.\n\nThe service from the staff was great though, they were very nice and friendly.\n\nOne other thing which we thought was strange. They have these beautiful black take out bags. And we noticed a “scan for a surprise “ on the bag. Once scanned all it did was take us to their website to read more about them aha. Which is fine .. but we weren’t sure how much of a surprise that was. Was a bit misleading. Maybe it should say “ scan for more info about us “ instead.

offers a large selection of Asian dishes at a reasonable price! I would recommend trying this place.\n\nIt was quite a trek to get here from Vancouver, but it was made easier by its proximity to a SkyTrain station. The restaurant itself is fairly plain but has some decorations and signage that add character.\n\nService was good but not exceptional, and I had no complaints. My order was taken promptly and the food arrived after an acceptable amount of time. Finally, I was able to pay once I asked for a bill and I left without much delay.\n\nThe food itself was delicious! I was concerned about the quality before visiting since I had doubts about the restaurant's ability to make so many different dishes, but I was soon proven wrong. The flavours were rich and the portions were large, so it was a challenge to finish it all.\n\nAlthough it's not the fanciest location, it's definitely worth trying and I recommend this to anyone looking for a restaurant that can showcase the flavours of Asia!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOoJa6-6H2OZX-fJFbupITE6G2UjmCytTCROUn-\u0026fid=0x0:0x6dc6d277978a22d7""],""When"":""2024-7-22""},{""Name"":""Ruby E."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVTXhvN-EpNac4Qr_mgdf5IDJLY8uKSuinXxuVkhfUtlVyIdrlu=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Finally got a chance to check out their Asian cuisine and was really impressed with the quick service and delicious dishes.

The first server, a lady, guided us to our seats and helped us order two lunch deals and an additional side. The food tasted fine, and the prices were okay. The environment was decent, but the service was shockingly rude.\n\nWhen my mom asked for takeout boxes and the bill, a different, younger male server came by, literally tossed the boxes onto the table, and walked away. When he returned with the bill and card machine, he dropped them on the table and left again without a word. It was the worst dining experience I've ever had. He didn’t say a single sentence to us the entire time, and I wondered how he was even qualified to be a server. I still paid the 12% tip because I was in a rush and a client was messaging me. Miraculously, the moment he saw I left a tip, he finally said, 'Thank you.'\n\nIf I hadn’t been in a rush, I would’ve found the manager and asked if this is how they treat customers. To top it off, as we were finishing our conversation and about to leave, the first lady server came up and started clearing the table while we were still sitting, with food still on the table. Asking a simple question like, 'Is it okay to take your plates away?' wouldn’t have hurt. I’m genuinely curious—is it that hard for them to communicate with customers? I understand wanting to clean up, but all the tables around us were empty.\n\nI felt like we were being treated like parasites, where no one wanted to serve us.

It had been a few years since we last went there and I'd been itching to go there for awhile. As the name of the shop implies, they serve Roti, but not just any Roti...they serve Trinidadian style Roti. My mother was born and raised in Trinidad, so Trinidadian food holds a special place in my heart.\n\nTrinidadian Roti is basically a wrap sandwich that's filled with curried meat, vegetable or seafood filling. There's dhalpourie roti or paratha roti (also known as bussup shut). Rehanah's Roti sells dhalpourie roti. Difference between dhalpourie and bussup shut? The explanation I've heard is that bussup shut is \""busted up\"" into tattered pieces.\n\nRoti: We ordered Shrimp Roti and Mixed Veggie Roti. Awesome flavour; however the filling is heavy with potatoes and sparse on the other ingredients. The Vegetarian Rotis are all under $10; however, the meat and seafood Rotis can be a bit pricey considering how much of the Roti is filled with potato.\n\nService: Fair (One woman running the entire shop. She takes the order, runs the till, and makes the food.)\nParking: Free street parking\nLocation: On St. Johns St., which is a main street lined with shops and restaurants in Port Moody.\n\nIt's a very small restaurant and as a result of the pandemic they only do takeout. There is however, a small table and chairs to sit and wait while your order is being prepared.There are so few places that serve Trinidadian food.

With the same entry fee, and four times the attendees, one would think the Port Moody Legion would be supportive of the event.\n\nOn arrival, before the event start, I went to the bar to order two beverages, along with glasses of water. I was informed that management had just instigated a policy of only selling bottled water. I have run across this policy before, when one is only requesting water. I have never been refused water with a meal or a beverage order before.\n\nTo reinforce a poor management decision, the manager chose not to be available for the inauguration of this policy.  This is unfair to the employees, who must face the sour customers. Luckily, the bartender had good customer service skills dealing with the unfortunate position he was placed in.  I guess the bartender will either find a better establishment for employment or become the manager at this Legion.\n\nWe will definitely not be recommending that our Legion friends drop into this branch.  It will just be a story of how good we have it at home!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Shannon Craig"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKkcCTiYPJx6mTtL4cFio0D_2WqDJBVB2_sRqMM-Qko3xx7=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Enjoyed my experience at the Port Moody Legion.

Anyways, in the area taking care of some business so decided to try this location out.\n\nIt’s located on the front side of Coquitlam Center and facing the new Cactus Club, plentiful of parking is available up front in the malls parking lot.\n\nInside is separated into to section; Neptune Wonton for fast casual dishes and Neptune Seafood for more of a formal dining. It’s kind of a smaller place and pretty basic to me.\n\nAnyways, here were the dim sum I ordered;\n\n1. Seafood dumpling in soup. The imitation crab being used made the broth a bit overly sweet, was too unpleasant to finish it.\n2. Steamed spicy beef tripe. It wasn’t tender enough, needed to steam it a bit longer.\n3. Steamed chicken feet with special sauce. It wasn’t tender enough for the skin to fall off the bone, needed to run through the deep fryer a bit longer during the prep process.\n4. Turnip cake with XO sauce. It’s almost a joke, my 10 year old nephew could’ve done better with this dish especially its presentation. Failed!\n5. Baked preserved egg and ginger pastry. Absolutely horrible, the preserved egg was rubbery and the whole pastry crumbled along with its ginger paste. Failed!\n6. Fried vegetables with shrimp paste. An alternate version of the deep fried eggplant with shrimp paste. It was so so.\n7. Baked bbq pork buns. It was okay, the bbq pork could be less sweet.\n8. Purple rice roll with fish paste. It was okay, the super jumbo size was unexpected.\n9. Stir fry udon with live lobster. Surprisingly it was pretty good, enough wok hay to really bring out the flavours.\n10. Little white rabbit pudding. Not bad, cute little treats.\n\nOverall, I wasn’t too impressed with the layout and atmosphere of the restaurant. It portray itself as a mid class Chinese seafood restaurant, but felt l like a simple family restaurant with mid level prices.\n\nThe service was okay, enough to satisfy the basics, don’t expect anything more than that.\n\nAs for the food, honestly it was probably one of the most disappointing experience I had so far out of all the Neptunes I’ve been to.\n\nNot a repeat or recommendation from me anytime soon… 1.5 stars"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQR35TFh2sABn6mWQv4-F7inIjdWxHkqeXqX1w\u0026fid=0x0:0xe8960ddf73ad1704""],""When"":""2024-6-3""},{""Name"":""Danny Y"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8eoyUE6az-FmQo7i2mVq5z64Ow48sgKu1EmLZc0zWWN6DMy5asw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Came for dimsum.

We got the chicken 🍗 one, and was pleasantly satisfied after.\n\nSure, Mega Donair might not be the cheapest eatery in the souk, but with the quality and freshness of their ingredients, plus the friendliness of the staff, it’s worth every dinar. The service is as warm as a Middle Eastern bazaar, and the flavors will take your taste buds on a magic carpet ride.\n\nSo, if you’re in Port Moody and craving a donair that’s fit for a king, head over to Mega Donair.

We gave a 5 for atmosphere as we have read reviews stating how comfortable the diner is and therefore had to give a 5 for that reason. We had the Bacon Cheeseburger and Clubhouse sandwich. Both were delicious. My husband said that the burger is one of the best that he has had. The burger was loaded with tomatoes, bacon and onions and he really liked the burger sauce that came with it as well. The bacon was thick and my husband said that the caramelized onions made the burger. I also found my Clubhouse to have been very good also with thick bacon, ham, and a generous amount of grilled chicken. The fries were crispy and the picture with the Clubhouse did not have all the fries that came with the order. We both have left overs for tomorrow. We are always cautiously optimistic when ordering home delivery due to the food not being fresh out of the kitchen. Well, we were so pleased with our meals and will definitely be ordering again. We are looking forward to trying out more items on the menu.

Despite the restaurant not being very busy, our server seemed disinterested and hardly checked on us. We had to flag them down multiple times just to get basic things like water refills.\n\nThe food, which I was looking forward to the most, was underwhelming. The pierogi were bland, lacking any real flavor or seasoning, and the filling was far too dry. The borscht was greasy and tasted more like something that had been reheated multiple times rather than freshly made. It was also way too salty, which made it hard to finish.\n\nThe manager/owner, when I raised my concerns, was dismissive and unhelpful. Rather than apologizing or offering a solution, they seemed indifferent to our experience. It’s always frustrating when management doesn’t take feedback seriously, and it only made the situation worse. It felt like they weren’t interested in improving their service or maintaining customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I won’t be returning.

But every body knows, in our modern times, this equation is quite impossible in big cities because of the cost and profit concerns.\n\nBut in this pizza shop they nearly got the perfect combination.\n\nThey have a real stove oven at the right temperature, good quality ingredients and handmade authentic dough.\n\nBoth pizza and Foccacia are nicely crusty and juicy. The Tomato sauce is not bitter nor too sweet, just yummy and fresh  ;-).\n\nToppings and mozzarella have a very good price to quality ratio.\n\nAll the ingredients are really really fresh 👍\n\nA suggestion for them, I think you should make a pizza with different ingredients which are hard to find in PoCo\n\nAnd for me the most important thing , people in this pizza shop are really happy, hospitable, positive and energetic. They really smile to you because they just want to. The total vibe is just like the warm and welcoming family owned pizza shops in Italy too 😍😍.\n\nPs: I asked the owner to tour the kitchen because of my cleanliness obsession.

They had to confirm with the other barista which drinks could be made decaf, and what non-dairy milk options they had. Unfortunately, after the fact, I noticed that on my receipt, they charged $0.75 for my oat milk substitution (their drink menu board lists non-dairy as an additional $0.50).\n\nOn a Sunday morning, it was quite a popular place with groups sitting in to chat as well as customers taking out.

In the end, decided on this place since it’s been decade or longer since I have been to this place.\n\nUpon entering, it seems like the interior went through a bit of change and renovation. The place was pretty empty except for 3 booths seated with customers, maybe it was near closing time (1.5hrs before closing). Everything appeared to be clean throughout the restaurant with a comfortable spacing between the tables and booths.\n\nThe service was subpar from the server, maybe she was more focused on cleaning and getting off work. When the owner/ manager took over, it was a lot better and she was more polite.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Sizzling Hot plate combo B+B (chicken steak \u0026 sausages) with borscht soup, spaghetti , cold lemon tea. The chicken was a little dry and the soup was a bit off and warm only. And the hot plate didn’t sizzle at all, maybe a 3 second frisk sound?\n2. Sizzling hot place combo A+B (filet mignon \u0026 deep fried oysters) with lobster bisque, steamed rice, add lobster tail $23 extra. The filet mignon was horrible, first time ever struggling to chew a filet mignon, it was dry and didn’t taste fresh. The oysters were little midgets. The steamed rice was more like overnight rice just added a bit of water and a quick heat up by the microwave, it was dry and hard. And lastly the lobster tail was horrible; it had that bad fishy taste to it, one tiny bite from that and had to stop cause not worth food poisoning myself from it. And once again the sizzling plate wasn’t even warm!! (Facepalm) The only thing okay was the lobster bisque.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed with the food. I don’t remember it being this bad? What happened? Closer to closing time and whoever the cook in the kitchen was didn’t give 2 cents about the food being served? Is it really that hard to hire a decent cook nowadays after the pandemic? And for crying out loud, it only takes 30 seconds to heat up the iron plates and how can one pawn off such a bad bowl of rice in a Chinese restaurant? I honestly would send this cook packing for retirement if working for me, definitely wouldn’t tolerate this kind of bs jeopardizing my business.\n\nI guess I retained my good nature and composure by taking into consideration that the owner/manager was very polite and friendly; very poise and elegant with the services. I guess that’s the only good part of this experience and kept my positivity inlined. Just enjoyed a quick instant noodle when back home lol"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMMcEYpyZUuanHEcQL55fa0WprgsuAX0S3V4h87\u0026fid=0x0:0xa9d123f17cb34070""],""When"":""2024-1-25""},{""Name"":""Chang Wun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXinnRETbtdmwq0G3dzHpocXq4c0y1kT8tCLTmXT5-MPrsCx3WH9g=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went back for the breakfast.

If you become a member, which costs $15 per year, you can enjoy a 10% discount on all orders, which is a great deal.\n\nOne of the highlights of Copa Cafe is their breakfast menu, which boasts generous portions that won't hurt your wallet despite the current high prices. On my recent visit, I opted for the satay beef noodle and shared the cheese, spinach, and bacon omelette with my husband. We also ordered two cups of their famous Hong Kong-style milk tea. After applying the 10% membership discount, our bill was a reasonable $23 with the tip included.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with both the quality and quantity of our breakfast. The flavors were satisfactory, and the portions were generous. Copa Cafe is a must-visit spot for anyone who loves Hong Kong-style cuisine and wants to try something new.

They could have used a few more servers on a busy Saturday night, but the staff were very friendly and immediately responsive whenever we asked.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, including the seafood hot pot, fishcake soup and fried fish. Amazing flavours and textures, with generous portions that are ample for sharing! The fried items were light \u0026 crispy. The steaming umami soups had just the right amount of spicy kick. You won't find traditional bibimbap, japchae or pancakes because their menu heavily features innovative takes on fresh seafood - not for those with shellfish allergies!

this one.  We went during happy hour for a friend's birthday as a table of four.  Even at the peak during our visit, the restaurant was at max, half full, but they did have a large reservation table of about twenty.  The food was good, but the service was SLOW.\nThey were clearly short-staffed, as the manager was working behind the bar while we were there, but we had to ask other servers to find our waitress twice and went up to the bar once to order our drinks because we had been waiting for so long.  That being said, they apologized profusely and comped us free desserts and did explain that they were short staffed. However, if you're offering a happy hour with one dollar oysters in a nice, reputable restaurant, then you should be prepared.\nWe ordered both off the happy hour menu and the regular menu and there was small tweaks. We would have made to each dish, but overall, a pretty satisfying meal.\nWe will give them another shot to see if the slow service was a one off.\nIf you park in the underground and register you license plate at the hotel desk, parking is free."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPzq5Fru9vEfYxmcJR5xpopeyv6MziJcBBPsKfk\u0026fid=0x0:0xcea729f7201067c9""],""When"":""2024-10-29""},{""Name"":""Olivia Ng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUIR4XKe445qsIhcDQSa4vWiOM9DrqY3ui4NVU5_YRxUleaadGk6w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I celebrated my husband's birthday at this restaurant during happy hour.

Let me tell you, this place knows how to make your taste buds do the cha-cha. I waddled in expecting a quick sugar rush and left with a full-on breakfast love affair. Here’s the scoop:\n\nFirst off, the chocolate chip cookie dough doughnut. It’s like someone took my childhood dreams of sneaking cookie dough out of the fridge and deep-fried them into a perfectly golden doughnut. Absolute perfection. Then there was the apple crumble doughnut—crispy, sweet, with that lovely crumbly topping that made me think of Grandma’s kitchen (if Grandma was a Michelin-star chef in disguise). Together, they were like the dynamic duo of dessert—Batman and Robin, but covered in sugar and far tastier.\n\nNow, let me talk about the cheesy smoky breakfast sandwich. My friends, I have had a lot of breakfast sandwiches in my day. I’ve been around the eggy block, had my share of bacon-stacked bagels, and yes, even tangoed with the occasional McMuffin. But this one? It was life-altering. Like, call-your-mom-and-tell-her-you-found-the-one kind of good. I’m not even joking when I say this was the best breakfast sandwich I’ve ever had. Hands down, no debate. The cheese was melty, the smokiness was spot on, and the bread hugged the filling like it knew I needed that kind of emotional support that morning. Bravo, Doughnut Love, bravo.\n\nAnd then there was the pistachio latte. I thought it was pretty good—creamy with that distinct pistachio nuttiness. But my girlfriend? She took one sip, wrinkled her nose, and gave me that look like I had just offered her a cup of blended brussels sprouts. So yeah, it’s a bit of a polarizing beverage. I was happy, she wasn’t, and I ended up with two lattes. Win-win for me, honestly.\n\nOverall, Doughnut Love is definitely worth the visit. Whether you’re after doughnuts that’ll make you reconsider what you know about dessert or a breakfast sandwich that might just change your life, this is the spot. Plus, it’s always fun to take your taste buds on an adventure—even if it means having to finish your partner’s drink. Check it out. Trust me, your stomach will thank you."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBicJQNVZ3eHQ0mQVOJAQIJgDpPzUg6SHE_QzI\u0026fid=0x0:0xfe2868f806edf31d""],""When"":""2024-10-5""},{""Name"":""Sunny Bui"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKMzWAiXdng0rCtZP9l45dHvlvYqeLHGoUweyd_OjqtW7kL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing Donut Place!

Unfortunately, i have to change the mark to 1 star because of the following objective evidences:\n\""Although you mentioned that your supplier has an accredited halal certificate, based on my observations during everyday shopping and watching your Deli and Meatshop employees, it seems that you are not adhering to halal provider rules. Specifically, you are selling halal and non-halal meat together and using the same knives and surfaces to cut them. The regulations in this regard are similar to those for allergen and non-allergen items, where cross-contamination is strictly prohibited. Rather than this, open packages of halal and non-halal meat inside the freezer or fridge should be completely separated. I recommend that you read the Halal International Standard requirements for retail stores. Until you are able to meet these standards, please remove all halal signage from your store, as it is misleading to Muslim customers in this regard\"""",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ali Fasihizadeh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXeEgxRiuCQGGcgBhaC0R0-E7HN9SKaiGfOrL8NTnYlp6WMk2xa=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I recently ordered a birthday cake to Suzan at the bakery and I couldn’t be happier with the result!

I did not want to drive all the way back for a little refund that. The following week while shopping at the store, I informed the cashier. All I sought was a simple acknowledgment of my concern and an apology for the inconvenience. Instead, what followed was a lengthy justification about how fresh bread can spoil overnight due to moisture. Additionally, the cashier explained their return policy, stating that I should have brought back the receipt and the rotten bread for a refund.\nI felt that the response lacked empathy and a proper understanding of customer service. The interaction came off as arrogant, and it left me feeling undervalued as a customer. It is disappointing to know that, as a loyal customer, my concerns were not taken seriously.

We wished that the desserts were more varied - they were heavily matcha/red bean centered and on the less sweet side because of the Korean owned establishment.

When I got home with our order, I noticed that my husband's dip has a best before date of Jan 31, 2025. My dip, however, is listed as Sept 18, 2024 (so, 3 weeks from now). We are a 2-person household who like different pizzas and different dips / flavours. As with everything, the cost of pizza and dips, etc has gone up. A jar now costs $7.65 (a little less than 1/2 the cost of a small pizza). I can't possibly eat this much dip in 3 weeks time, and am annoyed that my husband's dip will last so much longer than mine. So, when I call to complain, I'm told that \""customer care\"" says that the dips only last for two weeks after they've been opened, and that they can't help, compensate or accommodate me in any way because the dip wasn't sold as expired! Unbelievable. What terrible customer service. I'm suddenly much more motivated / inclined to give our money to one of the many other pizza places in Port Moody.

You can ask for certain cuts while they cut the meats for you. They are brought by the server to every table. My favourite was the pork ribs. So much flavour and so tender.  The grilled pineapple with cinnamon was also so delicious. This is the perfect place for meat lovers.

We went in a nice weather afternoon. 4/5\nService is excellent, from servers to bartenders. 5/5\nFood is average 2/5. It has a good range but no premium meats.\nIt has sausage, pork belly, lamb leg, beef flank, beef flank steak, beef strip loin, chicken heart, bacon wrapped chicken, but no premium parts like short ribs or tenderloin. So I would only want to go again if it’s $35 per person. I don’t eat much and I don’t feel it’s cost worthy. It could be great for young adults who eats a lot.\nThe good part about their food and services is that they would cut the cooked portion off and go back to cook again, measuring the best time.\nI enjoy the top sirloin (which I cannot cook so well at home) which is very soft and smooth. Chicken heart is tender and good as well. Another recommendation is flank steak, so tasty.\nI normally enjoy strip loin (New York steak) but I don’t like theirs because the center is too chewy and the outside is well done already. They cut such a thick portion and I cannot cut or chew the size they gave me.\nAnother thing I wouldn’t recommend is the chickens wrapped by bacon, because the chicken breast is dry and flavorless.\nForgot to mention, my wife enjoyed the deep fried banana and pineapple, and she had to order the second basket.\n\nOverall, great place to hangout with friends because they don’t kick people away, you can take your time to enjoy the night; but not very worthy of going with young child because you cannot take your time.

We don't recommend nor will we be ordering anything from them in the future... even though we only had the Indian since it was mediocre we are going to have to assume the rest is as well.

This is the first time we've dined outside since the restrictions and it was a pleasant experience :). If I had one small critique, the burger patty itself sort of just seemed like someone cut out a round shape straight out of a ground beef package and then put it on the grill. You know when you get a ground beef package, the meat is squiggly. You could see the squiggly meat shape in the patty when it was served to us, which indicates that the patty itself probably wasn't seasoned. The burger still tasted good!

The restaurant was immediately called to inform them. They stated that we needed to contact skip for a refund (which is fine!) and said the chicken was raw due to how busy the restaurant was tonight. Unfortunately, I do not see this as a valid reason for serving undercooked meat. They offered to remake the meal and have me come and pick it up.

aesthetic at this coffee shop, which is situated alongside a presentation centre and also features a small pop-up shop from Fable (housewares). The layout is very open but still features a good amount of comfortable seating including seating for large groups, and a beautiful patio out back. The service was friendly.\nI had a blackberry \u0026 brie grilled cheese, a vegan rye cookie, and a tropical espresso spritz (seasonal drink, like an espresso tonic with coconut and pineapple flavours). Everything was really good! I love fruit with brie cheese so the grilled cheese was an easy winner for me. The blackberry spread was tart and jammy which balanced out the rich brie cheese. I loved the funky flavour of rye in the cookie and the chewiness. The espresso spritz was very refreshing in this hot weather! It had deflated a little by the time I took the picture, but it had an impressively foamy crema layer. Even though nothing was really fancy or experimental, all the food/drink items I tried had something to make them a little unique."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMCEBQuCDIsCUWtrbHKFNiwZ3ZKq7ylWlDlHn48\u0026fid=0x0:0x775eee3d482be6bc""],""When"":""2024-7-21""},{""Name"":""Vicente Barreiros"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWXXjeDynmf81Pwbj0gtZnbrkTAQXze5uhpr2fBUeDvR8QxnMvZfQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Absolutely fantastic experience at The Outpost Café in Coquitlam!

As we had our dog with us, we decided to sit outside. The mocha had a great taste, but the espresso wasn’t  my preferred flavor ..

Due to power outages, we decided to have dinner at Mr. Mike’s, a place we’ve been to before.

The staff took it back to warm it up, but that was just the beginning.\n\nI ordered a medium-rare steak, as I always do, but it came out rare. The meat was incredibly tough, making it almost impossible to cut and chew. On my first bite, I nearly choked and had to be helped by a nearby table. Shockingly, the manager didn’t seem to care about the situation at all. They simply removed the cost of the meal from the bill, without offering any real apology or concern.\n\nI was left struggling to breathe, and the only comment the manager made was, “You ordered a medium-rare steak.” I always order medium-rare, and I know the difference between rare, medium-rare, and medium. This steak was not only rare but also so tough that it was hard to cut in the first place!\n\nI am deeply disappointed with the lack of care or professionalism shown during this experience.

Will not ever be returning to this location.\nAlso to add the Bellini I had was definitely definitely not worth the price I paid for either and had like no alcohol in it! Another major let down which is another staple CC is known for!\nHave had mediocre service from this location before and now after this last service will definitely not be returning! For the $50 I paid for just myself it 100% was not at all worth the price. My co workers complained about the lack of attentiveness and poor food quality as well and said they won't be returning either. Usually cactus club is an A++ but they absolutely more than missed the mark on this night.
