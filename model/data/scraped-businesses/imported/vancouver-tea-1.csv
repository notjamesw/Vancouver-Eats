Both coffees were above average, with the Spanish latte being particularly noteworthy. The chicken bacon club sandwich was a tasty complement to the beverages.\n\nThe overall environment, vibe, and music were welcoming and pleasant.

I love The Open Mic (every Thursday from 7:00 p.m.) and the Whiskey Jams (subject to programming). These two events are attended by artists who, from my perspective, have nothing to envy of an international one.\nAnother aspect that I find lovely is the generous spirit of the owner of the Café because, with the funds raised at the Open Mic, donations are made to a program known as City Smiles, which seeks to impact the vulnerable community in the sector.\nSome moments and situations mark your life forever.

I used the kratom first. The Kratom worked it kept my symptoms at bay ( not elaborating ) it might have been what it's supposed to be. Other than it managing my symptoms it did nothing more. I took enough for it to be a recreational dose. I ate two grams of the enigma mushrooms the following day and my vision barely got distorted at all colours were shifting a small amount that's it. So I took the 1.5 i had left a few hours later but it seemed I had already metabolized most of what I took earlier no change really. I'm sensitive to mushrooms I usually trip hard. The lsd I took all at once the whole supposed 222 micrograms and basicly got a similar effect of the mushrooms but a bit more euphoria and a nice tingling feeling colours were changing and I got a bit of a glow around things and stuff was in my perceived reality changing size a bit back and forth but nothing major. 222 micrograms is a good sized recreational dose and when I've took 1 small tab in the past it was way more powerful than this. I've taken a quarter tab and got higher than I did with this supposed 222 micrograms. The mushrooms and the lsd was I'd say 4 times the price of street stuff and way less powerful. If I had the option I'd buy it on the blackmarket but I didn't I was traveling I don't on the lower mainland. The people working there were very nice, polite and professional and the place was clean inside. It was nice just wish their products were stronger and cheaper maybe I got the wrong variety of shroom but I asked him what the strongest was and he said enigma. They sucked and lisergic acid doesn't have species so it just plain sucked can't get the wrong kind there. The kratom I have no complaints I don't know enough about it and it's the only time I've used it but if I had to guess I'd say that it wasn't powerful either. Oh and the owner makes condescending and defensive remarks when you give bad reviews. They always have an excuse for why the costumer is wrong somehow. Like when the drink sucks they lay the blame on something like you not adding enough sugar or cream to your Americano after lol. I think people know how they like to drink their coffee and added the appropriate amount of whatever additives they prefer. The customers always wrong here if you say something wasn't right, underdosed, disgusting or you didn't like it then it's you not them lol. Get off your high horse crap dispensary owner.

Plants abound in the industrial but cozy interior. A corner is dedicated to a small craft and plant market. The tables have a 1 hour time limit when it's busy. The food menu focuses on local and organic ingredients. The menu is almost entirely vegetarian save for a ham and cheese sandwich, and within those vegetarian options, many are vegan or can be made vegan.\nI ordered the 'chiken' salad sandwich ('chiken' made from soy curls), an oatmeal chocolate cookie, and a Hoochy Booch bellini kombucha on tap. The sandwich was great! The finely chopped soy curls in the salad had a great texture, and I loved the flavour pop from the cranberries. The sourdough bread was also excellent. The cookie was good - it was made with shredded coconut in addition to oats which made it crunchy and which I wasn't expecting, so it wasn't exactly what I hoped for, but if you like that texture, this would be great."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMiN1LqGDIXWdmdet6ZhTCfrlwXIENtQOMUVo8O\u0026fid=0x0:0xcb1f27ee3a5c6db0""],""When"":""2024-11-10""},{""Name"":""Charles Danyliuk"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV23IS4l_cNSx-eIUSbrr8gyghcWLset3QVnU7RKhh5NT4DIvlm=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""absolutely lovely place that I stopped into for lunch. a little on the pricy side, but absolutely delicious. the rose cardamom latte is to die for and this place has a potato salad I actually like! definitely will bring friends here again"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNiN_KNKBvnRJE99I4qr-VLUgRUr3pNtAiTAkAD\u0026fid=0x0:0xcb1f27ee3a5c6db0""],""When"":""2024-4-20""},{""Name"":""No MSG No Garlic Foodie"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-PVOn6GcWxsKb-qqVJDTqvJ5rfua5QVuFocwcMF-ZRwuEIPLm=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This was in my list of 'Want to Go' places. We were pleasantly surprised by the peaceful and comfortable atmosphere at The Garden. Being used to Yaletown Coffee shops which are typically high-energy places, it is nice to know that a tranquil coffee place exists not that far from Yaletown. They have a sitting room area with lots of plants arranged around a couch, a coffee table and a couple of chairs. Even though we didn't get to sit there, it is within our view at table 3, and we felt as though we were part of that space. Another thing I appreciated is the fact that they assign tables when you order the drinks – rather than the usual mad scramble for a seat in other crowded coffee shops. We were there for lunch, and it appears that the option for no garlic was quite limited. After consultation with the kitchen, the host offered a couple of options, one of which was a kale salad with custom vinaigrette, plus chicken if I preferred. That's what I ordered. It was a very delicious salad, and I would certainly go all the way there again just to have that salad again. We also ordered the breakfast sandwich which comes with potato salad. The espresso drinks were very well made, made with Agro Espresso, and very enjoyable. We will visit again! In fact, we did go back again the next week. I ordered the same salad and was surprised to find the chicken missing, so I asked for a side of chicken, and since I seemed to have no reaction previously, I thought it might be OK. But apparently, the chicken had been brined in garlic. Yuk. And because I did not have an oat latte before the food arrived, the garlic hit was kind strong enough that I decided we better go home instead of ordering coffee drinks, just to be safe. My partner ordered the lentil soup which contains garlic strong enough that he will probably not order it again. I was disappointed with the chicken the second time around because it was chewy and dry, not like the first time. Well, the hosts are very caring and lovely people, and it looks like lots of patrons are regulars and really enjoy their food. So, we hope that this place will flourish!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNUzQAXRYt1DbBalbVx6ne1ggARRTwJswWsGeuE\u0026fid=0x0:0xcb1f27ee3a5c6db0""],""When"":""2023-12-4""},{""Name"":""Julia D"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKWGHgIRg6UZB2wR1x2csycbI6ACHnuk_Z9bgnuPPHXuO-zSw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Love the vibe, the atmosphere and plants in every corner that make me feel so relax and comfortable.

The only reason that I have gone to this business is because sometimes I get off work late and would like to order something to eat…over the months that I have gone both the service and the quality of the food have dropped off significantly.\n\nThe staff seems super burned out. The food has become worse and worse. Today they were out of soup and the grilled sandwich that I opted for was ice cold. Also, there are flavors on my sandwich that should not even be there which leads me to believe that they don’t even scrape their sandwich press (or change gloves/wash hands) in between orders. I do not eat pork or beef. My sandwich that I ordered should not taste like pork. I wish they would’ve steered clear of my consciousness neighborhood instead of blowing up the scene\n\nThe photo I’ve shared shows a tuna “melt”.  It’s stodgy and gross and cold. I threw it out. I’ve never been to a Breka before they opened this location, but my mouth is forever soured and I will never spend money there again.

How has it taken me this long to visit this place? This has got to be one of my favourite tea houses in Vancouver now!\n\nWhat I love about this place is the variety of options they offer. There are options for omnivores, vegetarians and vegans at this place. Not only do they cater to different dietary restrictions but if you're wanting to spend a little less, or eat a little less they offer Mini Afternoon Tea sets! Regular Afternoon Tea sets are $55 per person and Mini Afternoon Tea sets are $38 per person. Oh, and  you can even order off a regular a la carte menu if Afternoon Tea fare isn't your thing.\n\nThe food here was excellent. Quality ingredients were used for our food and they didn't skimp on anything either. While 3 of us had Afternoon Tea, my husband decided to order from the a la carte menu. He had a lobster bisque and a sandwich. One of the best lobster bisques he's ever had. Possibly even the best!\n\nIt's a popular place so I do recommend reserving well in advance to get a good table. We reserved only one day in advance and were put on a couch with two very small tables in front of us, and a side table on our left. It took quite a bit of maneuvering to fit our food and drinks on the small tables provided, and I had to turn to my left to pick up the very heavy teapot every time I wanted to pour some more tea for any of us.

been here a few times and the staff have been consistently unwelcoming with bad customer service. The first time the girl got my order wrong. Then she refused to correct my drink and instead insisted that I ordered it. I left unhappy and none of the staff seemed to care.\nYesterday we decided to try it out again. Arrived and there was a BIG sign right in front of the till that said “After school special, 2 large drinks for $10”. So I ordered two of the golden aged milk tea with pearls. The lady said ok and asked what level of sugar and ice I wanted. She tried to enter it into the till. She had troubles applying the special deal and then asked her colleague. They spoke in their own language and tried to figure out how to input the deal. They could not figure it out and looked confused. Then a few minutes later she looks at me and says “The special is no longer available!”. I asked her why would you advertise something on a huge sign that is not available and then told her to take the sign away so as not to confuse customers.

They set the minimum spending and will try to push you to get food. The dessert cookies are tiny and tastes stale. There was minimal explanation for the tea or attempt at showing you the brewing or sharing knowledge about the tea other than saying “this is good tea, it’s expensive”.\n\nThen the argument is that you are here for the ambience , well not so much. When I was there I overheard the tea brewer talking loudly about indigestion, bowel movements and Chinese politics with a friend.

my top 5 favorite coffee shops in Vancouver. The one in Mount Pleasant wins in terms of ambiance, but this one on Hastings champions overall because of service, convenience, and the line is not as crazy as on Mount Pleasant.\n\nI already had a dose of coffee from Elysian today, but after lunch, I was tempted to have an another round when I passed by this cafe—I just couldn’t resist. I had a mocha and paired it with a pistachio swirl.\n\nThis is one of the few cafes where I can easily get a great coffee, and an amazing pastry which leaves you confused about which one to choose, plus a nice atmosphere- the vibe, music, etc..

They have a wide variety of coffees, cold drinks, pastries, sandwiches, soups and more. When I went, they had a combo deal going on for a free soup with any purchase of a sandwich and drink. Prices are quite reasonable as well. Currently only take-out or delivery. Friendly staff and quick service.\n\nMy order:\nDark Chocolate Peanut Butter Ball ($3.70): highly recommend this one! It’s basically a large Reece cup in a ball shape. Dark chocolate coated peanut butter ball, with chunks of real peanuts sprinkled in as well. It’s surprisingly not too sweet, but it’s quite rich so I’d recommend getting just one for the perfect after meal dessert (or pack a few for the road).\n\nFrappe Caramello ($6+): subtle caramel flavour, but it isn’t too sweet overall and is a great iced drink to cool down on a hot day. Most drinks come in small, medium, or large size.\n\nFrappe Mochalatto ($6+): It is more chocolate-y, so it’s perfect for people who don’t like strong coffee drinks. Slightly sweeter than the caramel frappe.\n\nBeef Sausage Roll ($3.70): flaky pastry dough, and they heat it up for you. Nice and filling snack.\n\nTurkey Panini (~$9): they heat this up on a panini grill for you. Comes with cheddar cheese, sundried tomato, pesto, spinach, and mayo on a house-made ciabatta bun. I like the sweet-tart flavour that the sundried tomato adds to the sandwich. Easy hot meal to take to-go.\n\nMacaroon Madness (~$3): I liked the oatmeal and coconut crumble on top, it adds a good texture and taste. There’s also a caramel drizzle on top. It has a soft mushy texture, but was a bit too sweet for my personal preference.\n\nCinnamon Twist: house-made as well, with a nice caramelized crunchy cinnamon top.

Especially the staff, who are all friendly. Their shrimp sandwiches are my favorite. The shrimp is fresh, and the smooth avocados and crispy grilled sourdough make a great combination for every bite. I'll try their salads and breakfast next time. It's worth traveling far to be here.\n* updated:Yesterday, I came here around 3:30 pm and discovered that all the salads had been sold out. Today, I arrived earlier, at around 12:30 pm, but encountered a long line, and once again found that the salads had sold out. However, I'm grateful that one of the male staff members was willing to ask the chef to prepare a salad for me. He also informed me that I could call ahead to reserve a salad. So, if you're planning to visit, make sure to arrive early or call ahead since the place is quite popular and busy during lunch hours."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOAeXthvgQ894tCayifD-p3zXZf-msP-BsVmklU\u0026fid=0x0:0x28a7795e1b801e03""],""When"":""2023-5-4""},{""Name"":""Brian B"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX7EgUPUwwc_O6sMMCdoF3PX68Oqbpl3CtqtRX2GaFa2ySFFqJBSQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""A hidden coffee shop for anyone who loves coffee.

Nice flavours between the earl grey, honey and nut cream. We liked how thick the nut cream was as it held well in transit, along with the \""hunny crumbs\"" and almonds. It was $10.20, which is a similar specialty pricing to Hot Chocolate Festival drinks.\n\nCustomers can adjust ice and sugar levels in their drinks. It's wonderful to have a \""mylk\"" tea shop focused on vegan options. Unfortunately, it's quite pricey as my nut mylk with pearls is regular $9.45 (before tax). I'm not in the Kitsilano area often and wouldn't make a special trip out, but I'd return if in the area for a treat!

The Taiwanese fried chicken was a bit too dry for my taste, and the sandwich I ordered came out burnt—the toast was way too dark. On the bright side, the Singapore fried noodles were really good.

ETea was able to throw in a discount so the drinks came out to just under $100, the drinks were ready at the time I was picking up, and my entire team greatly enjoyed the afternoon treat! Thank you for accommodating my team and making all of our bubble tea dreams come true, ETea! 😊\n\nAdditionally, we live in the neighborhood and really enjoy going to ETea for snacks or a meal. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. Our kids usually order the popcorn chicken rice or chicken wings, and the adults usually get the garlic scallop fried rice (ask for their hot oil sauce!), laksa, or curry. Their fresh fruit slush bubble teas are refreshing, and when we ask for the toppings on the side (when we dine in), the staff are always happy to accommodate us and bring us extra cups and little spoons for our kids to pick and scoop the various toppings into their individual cups.

It's actually quite hard to find a coffee shop that makes a decent sausage patty. With a vegan diet, I didn't expect to be able to ever again satisfy my craving until we stopped at this bakery to check out their vegan carrot cake. There, we saw a row of pictures advertising different kinds of breakfast sandwiches with 'SOLD OUT' signs on them. Understandable, it was after lunch on a Sunday. Of course, we came back a few days later for the sausage and egg muffin. For my first bite, I didn't like the 'muffin' bun. The sausage patty was very delicious though, very spicy without any hint of garlic (yay!), and I couldn't even tell that it was vegan. The egg tasted like egg, and because the cheese is also vegan, we didn't have to order this without cheese! After a few more bites of the sandwich, I started to enjoy the muffin bun as well, and on reflection, it is definitely better than the typical dried out English muffin you get at Starbucks. We also purchased croissants. The gold standard of croissants for us is Angus T's brioche dough butter croissants. But because that contains eggs and dairy, that's off my list as well. These croissants are very edible compared to an Angus T.  They lack the butter taste of an Angus T, but the texture inside is excellent, moist and chewy, and outside, it is crusty without being dried out. The third test was to compare the carrot cake with our favourite carrot cake from Milano Coffee made by Caffé de Medici, this was too sweet and I can taste the baking powder. I've known about To Live For Bakery for a while as their banana bread is sold in a lot of coffee shops and health food retail outlets. But since we are now on a low sugar diet, the VEGAN breakfast sausage and egg sandwiches and VEGAN croissants are already great finds for us, and I am sure we will drop by more often. We're not really keen on the sweet stuff. 5 stars for the breakfast sandwich and croissants. The bakery opens at 7 am. The breakfast sandwiches apparently start selling around 8 and can be sold out a couple of hours before closing. But twice now, we’ve been able to get them! Actually, I am getting addicted…"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNwAKG0-_YwdHdcSH63M08MakKvBXPSWX4SpSfZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x8b0b5f644e6d9eb7""],""When"":""2024-8-20""}]",

The interior is beautiful and I love the attention to detail. There is a wide selection of tea to choose from and I enjoyed the Mumbai chai. I was surprised to see our teapot arrived with no tea bag or tea leaves inside. I don't order tea often but when I do, the tea is left to brew which is great for those of us who enjoy a stronger cup of tea.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian high tea and my partner had the standard. There was little difference between the two. His arrived with one chicken sandwich and my alternative was a tofu sandwich which unfortunately I didn't enjoy. The sweets were good but again, for the most part, my partner and I did not enjoy them. I appreciate that this is about individual taste rather than the actual quality of the sweets. It is not possible to order anything else from the menu on the weekend other than high tea.\n\nThe website lists a spring and a summer high tea amongst others. When our bill arrived, I was under the impression, given that we are still in spring, we would be charged for the spring high tea however this was not the case. When I asked, I was informed that the spring high tea menu ended on mother's day and that they are on the summer high tea menu. This surprised me as we are still very much in spring.\n\nOver the years I've tried several different high tea options both here in Canada and overseas and unfortunately this high tea wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOG-IuC0ze63cWkMnbZ8VLCG7_Jjxi5E8-xq15M\u0026fid=0x0:0xda28c3280cbe4ac6""],""When"":""2024-5-29""},{""Name"":""Andrea Smith"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLpuVBU8Cr4kuXCWAkWLm8v5JbEFLyz07AUAoxz_KpO9adA0u7P=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Went to the Wicked themed high tea and it was fantastic!

Upwards of $60 for a three tiered delight of sweets and savouries, you are paying for the \""experience\"".\n\nThis includes being surrounded by a medley of disparate but charming decor that somehow manages to look like it all belongs together, the use of fine china dishes, delicate teacups, and usually an actual bowl of sugar complete with a tiny metal spoon. A rounded pot filled with aromatic loose leaf tea rounds out this teaparty, a decidedly more adult affair than the one we used to have as kids using stuffies as guests.\n\nHigh Tea is a luxury to be sure, not an everyday event. The Secret Garden was my go to, but I was persuaded to try Neverland. I wasn't expecting anything different in terms of the novelty, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much better the service and overall encounter was.\n\nAt Secret Garden, you choose one tea and are stuck with it for the duration of your stay. It is also up to you to steep it for however long you see fit. Neverland is unique in that you are encouraged to try different teas after each teapot is drained. I think that I sampled at least four. Not only that, but they actually brew and steep the tea for you so that the guesswork is taken out of the equation. A great marketing strategy on their part, as if you happen to fall in love with a particular tea, it is available for purchase.\n\nFoodwise, the items at Secret Garden are laughably smaller than Neverland's. And the famed lemon tart and egg salad on a pink bun\nthat are constant fixtures on the Secret Garden High Tea menu have long since lost their appeal.\n\nI am a carnivore at heart and usually give vegetarian items a hard pass, but I found myself tentatively nibbling on the vegan savouries and finding them to be surprisingly delicious. That alone has ingratiated Neverland to me, because trust me, I'm the first one to decline any vegetable that crosses my path.\n\nOur server at Neverland was constantly checking up on us and ensuring that our table always had a steady stream of filled teapots for my party and I to mix and match. Once the server delivers your three tiered meal at Secret Garden they seem to disappear and only reappear to hand you the bill.\n\nSuffice to say you never need to settle for a merely passable High Tea service again. Head over to Neverland for a few hours of enchantment, where everyone is indeed mad as their sign implies, but in the best way possible."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTxNHm8VjDgHJRg-xkfdnVcN0KjdEhoJI3GqBo\u0026fid=0x0:0xda28c3280cbe4ac6""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""W"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVijg2B2FKhHEO0daffmmkqtpWCzt3aDQdnZOIHflF7afjJd1G7=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""2023: Mad Hatter's high tea.

Simply the best Mexican food in the lower mainland.\n\nThe atmosphere is modern but welcoming and comfortable; our server Eileen made us feel at home and made great recommendations for our first time. We're planning to become regulars because this is one of those places that you can eat exceedingly well without ever feeling uncomfortable; ingredients are fresh, top-quality, and dishes are healthy but oh so satisfying.\n\nFor instance, nowhere in BC will you ever find chayote (pear squash) salad, aguachile (like a ceviche), or tortas ahogadas (typical subs from Guadalajara with Livia bread) because this kitchen is miles ahead of the cookie-cutter Mexican food that we're used to here, offering us vegetarians and meat eaters sophistication and deliciousness at great prices.\n\nThe drinks are another refreshing (lit) feature: cocktails prepared with care in vintage glasses or wonderful brews, and a fun zero-proof selection like Jamaica (sorel).\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, they have a great playlist that had us grooving and vibing for the whole time! I can't wait to try the whole menu because every dish and drink our party order was scrumptious, satisfying, and prepared with care.

Kitsilano is lucky to have this place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNzld1a32bIuxJbSk_qGGOkOT4aB_y7WKYINqCA\u0026fid=0x0:0xa9a265daf8eaa0dc""],""When"":""2024-6-1""},{""Name"":""mickey grace"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW2koY7ZFfBdWpziRjPP5TFVjsrz4r1zt6MPtsM4mBH9nhU6uE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It offers such a relaxing atmosphere—sipping tea, enjoying desserts, and chatting with friends feels so delightful!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNnweX_Z_b9jjKr21twA9S8lD64r26f8fZ393Yp\u0026fid=0x0:0xa9a265daf8eaa0dc""],""When"":""2024-11-30""},{""Name"":""Alvin Pang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVHzcspRq9zYs02sQw-GRlpcEtcdrsvpnBrdgmJYnEInlXCURVIiw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""One of the best tea bars I’ve been to anywhere in the world, with well-curated selections of delicious rarities from across Asia, including the Himalayas.

The food presentation looked okay at first glance, but the actual bites were low quality. Everything was dry and the portions were really small. The scone was a big letdown—it was hard and crumbly, not the soft and fluffy scone you'd expect.\n\nThe prices were outrageous for what we got. I don't mind paying more for quality, but this just wasn't worth it. The spreads were unappealing and uninteresting, barely enough for one person, let alone two.

She recommended getting the two sets/kits which I am very grateful for her advice! When I picked up a very friendly gentleman was the one to help me.

I ordered Creme Brulee Milk Tea, Sweater of Winter and Grape Jasmine Tea.\n\nCreme Brulee: I was bringing these drinks home for my family so I didn't try this Creme Brulee drink until I got home. One thing I'll say for this drink is that I was impressed with how solid the big chunk of Creme Brulee sitting on top of the drink was. For reasons beyond my control, I didn't make it home for another 3 hours. By the time I got home, I was afraid the Creme Brulee might have completely dissolved into the drink. To my surprise, the Creme Brulee was still in tact!\n\nSweater of Winter: This drink had a big swirl of whipping cream on top with lots of crunchy little chocolate balls dispersed throughout the whipping cream. It came with a lid that had a sliding window on it. The little kid inside me fell in love with this lid. The mini chocolate balls were fun to crunch on as well!\n\nGrape Jasmine Tea: Grape flavoured Jasmine Tea with a couple slices of lime, white pearls and some kind of white jelly at the bottom. The Grape flavor was delicious and I enjoyed the texture of the white pearls and jelly.\n\nMy daughter wants me to bring her to Momono Tea Shop so she can try the drinks right away next time.

Despite the class mentioning an introduction, we found ourselves asking a lot of questions. Still, it was a wonderful experience, and I left with my new favorite matcha—delicious, perfectly balanced, and a vibrant green. I'll definitely be buying all my matcha here going forward.

It’s a fantastic addition to Main Street and truly offers something special. Definitely worth checking out!\n\nI'd love to attend more events in the future.

Of couse, he was apologetic ahout it, several times for not being able to take care of us. Overall, the tea tasting itself was good, but took way longer than an hour, and the session ended up being not as intimate as we hoped. I would not necessarily do another tea tasting for $60, but would gladly come again for a cup of tea, which is about $15.\n\nThere are only 3 tables where customers can sit (max. of 10 people total in the shop), so I would only recommend this place for a group of 4 or less if you would like to sit down for some tea.\n\nStrongly recommended for a cup of tea \u0026 tea tasting session on a quiet day!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPWO9Wjr7JyHnbOSGbHvecOx3m_nhGPdSNgoQ1Q\u0026fid=0x0:0x5fa3e6a5f696cfa3""],""When"":""2023-11-17""},{""Name"":""Heqian Liu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVjk3zJ-agdd8QLGaNN7T-5S56_61__GOES0fU2Ai5ENSuV7nM0=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My fiancé discovered this place and brought me there as a surprise. It turned out to be a delightful experience. We tasted the Citrus Pu'er and Anji Baicha teas, each offering a unique flavor profile - the aged richness of the 13-year Pu'er and the unmistakable freshness of the first-harvest Anji Baicha.\n\nThe owner provided excellent service. The shop was quite busy at the time and he still managed to take care of us. He refill our tea once we finish our current cup. The ambiance of the establishment added to the overall enjoyment, creating a cozy space to savor our tea.\n\nWe also decided to take home a bag of their Green Peony. They do have an exceptional good quality of their tea leaves. We also ordered a bottole of the kombucha that they self-made in the shop.\n\nIn summary, our visit left us thoroughly satisfied. This place is definitely going to be our go to place in the future for teas. They provide way better quality of tea leaves than any other places we have been to in Vancouver. You don't have to worry about getting those bad tea leaves that you get from supermarket. You also don't need to worry about being not familiar with the tea culture as the owner was really good at introducing the teas in English.

This was me and my friend's first time and it was transformative. I truly recommend visiting this tea shop.\n\nThe moment you step into the space you feel transported to a calm, warm environment with the most tranquil music and calming aromas. The interior is designed by the owners and every aspect of the space is custom made. The meticulous eye for quality and taste shows in every piece of the store and extends into the tea themselves.\n\nMy friend booked us a tea tasting as a birthday gift to me and were met by one of the owners, Jude. He was extremely welcoming and kind to us. He started by explaining the process of tasting, including the temperatures and order. Jude thoughtfully arranged our tea choices into a tasting journey. Throughout the tasting we learned more about the sourcing of the tea, Jude's inspirations and life. I recommend you ask about the tea and business when you visit! Jude is a multitalented and kind individual with a lot of dedication to his teas. His happiness and love of tea is contagious.\n\nThe teas themselves are impeccable. We tried the new Pu'erh Fountain of the Forest tea, some Yuzu black tea, gold osmanthus tea, and the Gardenia Bird's Tongue. Never have I had such amazing tea. We were encouraged to smell and engage with each tea presented. We left with a bag of almost every tea we had tried because we loved them so much! I even bought a gaiwan early this week so I could enjoy the tea to its fullest. The tea tasting session is an amazing gift to give to others, it was one of the best gifts I have ever received.\n\nWe will definitely be coming back.

Fully five stars all the way for this place, in every category. For instance, besides having an excellent quality and range of beverages, Steam has a trendy/artistic feel to it, a great atmosphere, and as an emerging writer and actor, I have always really felt at home there. Because their personnel's people skills are so good, I've additionally become friends with the owner and the staff, and so I wrote them this poem of appreciation:\n\nTEA IN EACH N EVERY SEASON\n\nMercury Rhone\n\nSteam is the exhaled breath from expedited daydreams: about a small n secret corner parlour to rest n pause for an hour.\n\nI’m a permanent regular here cause cafes just don’t get any better. About places I like I’m very particular. And I’ve been to them all but still Steam I prefer. Considering that this beverage atelier exists on a different level of coffee mug comfort it’s Steam my sensibilities want.\n\nIndependent company logos on sleeves around takeout cups please. I want the graphic from this sweet zarf on a chocolate hued T shirt sized just right for me: I swear I’ll wear that garment right out.\n\nAnd more notes of praise to decorate the cosmic latte coloured wall that asserts hey I think I like certain hot drinks. Enough to partake of them daily. I do you see: it’s a socially healthy habit I pursue. Since I only work two blocks away lucky me.\n\nThe folks at the office thank me kindly when I bring them back on cardboard carrier chariot the nicest liquid treats from Steam’s umber brown wooden counter.\n\nBecause the products of the West 43rd Avenue n East Boulevard shop are those the community’s customers continue to consume. When they need to feel welcome and return to the world all palate renewed.\n\nSo sit here meditating urban patrons n drink tea in each n every season. Until the entire city seems calm n friendly much like a café does.\n\nOn a day in May I came across a one room tea boutique born at the bottom of a building w imposing stone architecture I admire. And I never left again I basically live here okay it’s true.\n\nYes it’s a tiny commercial tea chest in the best possible location for chic popularity: tea steam salon that it is. Coffee couturier. I feel quite fancy when I’m there so I’m never far away.\n\nBut I also sense I’m like a friend n neighbour: every single staff member remembers my name n my drink of choice. Steam’s team is the very picture of courtesy.\n\nSales in a steady stream are ushered into Steam by the wind and then the sun when they agree. The coffee bar’s clients must be sure to order lots of brewed mocha elixir if the sainted steeped tea is not enough to soothe the week’s fatigue.\n\nAnd also on offer hot chocolate with heart shaped vapour\non top. My heated favourite when the afternoon is an effort. Schedules can be arduous but a drop of peace on the clock is a joyous oasis.\n\nBecause while infinity’s business is an unstoppable train it can still always be seen: floating up from the engine of absolutely everyone’s continuum is steam.\n\nFor my friends at Steam Teahouse \u0026 Café, Kerrisdale,\nVancouver; from Mercury (Mason Mercury Rhone Mantonlorn); September 2024"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sarah Lysakowski"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU6GFCJSJe72DIAfLmtXyi6c4UVvVSXnN7809_G1NUBF64_Kk08=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Such a little gem off the main track of Kerrisdale.

As an adult, I’ve been learning more, but shops like these intimidate me because my Cantonese/Mandarin isn’t great. When I came here, I was greeted kindly by the shop owners’ son. He was so welcoming and let me try all kinds of new teas. He explained the story and history behind the teas, his family’s shop, and gave me tips about Vancouver too. I learned so much and it felt like chatting with a friend. Later, his mom stopped by and she was super nice. They love sharing their knowledge and letting you try new teas.\n\nI’m sad I don’t live in Vancouver, but I will purchase their tea online from now on.

The tea flavour is quite delicate, with options to substitute the milk with oat milk (for free!) and adjust the ice and sugar levels for certain drinks. Further, some drinks are caffeine free and available hot. It looks like there is only one size for drinks though. If you do opt for pearls, Cha Yuan’s have a nice chew/QQ to them. My favourite drinks so far have been Matcha Latte ($6.50) with Coffee Jelly (+$0.75), Hojicha Milk Tea ($6) with Grass Jelly (+$0.75), and Brown Sugar Pearl Latte ($6), all substituted with oat milk.\n\nCha Yuan is more of a grab and go, but there is some bar seating by the window should you choose to stay longer. Usually, there is only one staff member - at times, two - attending to both the till and the drinks, so there may be a slight wait. That said, the service is great, as is the quality of the drinks.

I tried the Oolong Brown Sugar Milk Tea with soy milk. Even though it is listed as being only 25% sweet, the brown sugar syrup is very sweet and delicious. I tried to ask for sweeter without knowing so, but they let me know 25% sweet is the only sweetness level the brown sugar drinks come in. The flavour was very smooth and not overpowering at all, I would gladly order it again. The fresh tapioca was fantastic as well, the pearls are not as large as some other places, but they have great flavour, mouthfeel, and chewyness. I just wished I had a bigger cup so I could get more! I also ordered a bubble waffle while I was here. My only gripe was that they did not serve it to me hot, but instead cooled it down in front of a fan so that it was not quite warm when handed to me. I also thought they may have browned it for too long, but it might have just been the sugar content in the batter that turned it dark, because it tasted very good even if it was cool."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Annie Vo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKlRehj8w3lb3TLvOkaFmtSslVabJxE4i1pJPr0ZgPJV2viQg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I love the boba and the drinks!

I got a BTS magnet, a Jungkook photo card, and a BTS photo for free. They had this really cute spot in the shop where you can take pictures with BTS props and a background I loved it SO MUCH. Stray Kids is my favorite K-pop group and the owner said that they were going to have a Stray Kids event in a few days and I was absolutely heartbroken that I couldn’t go because I’d love to see it. Also, I felt really welcome there and I felt like I already knew the staff because they were so kindhearted and lovely. For the drinks, I got a passionfruit black tea with mango popping boba and coconut jelly lychee (WHICH WAS THE BEST BOBA DRINK I EVER HAD), a passionfruit black tea with mango popping boba and mango stars (really delicious and cute stars), a passionfruit green tea with mango popping boba, and two mango smoothies. Everything was so yummy. Also, the staff is really generous with the amount of toppings they give which is 5-STAR (Stray Kids reference) behavior right there and that’s one of the reasons why I love them. I’m gonna be honest I never write reviews, but I loved this place so much that I just had to. By the way, they had LE SSERAFIM, TXT, BTS, ITZY, seventeen, and other K-pop group themed things.

Unfortunately, on this occasion, the drink I was served was disappointing. The staff member who prepared it seemed rushed, completing the order in less than a minute, and the drink did not meet your usual high standards. The taste was subpar, and the preparation appeared to lack care, as even the ice was not added properly.\n\nI value Chatime for its consistent quality and great service, which is why this experience stood out to me.

From its clean and modern ambiance to the wide array of delectable beverage options, this place has firmly secured its spot as one of my favorite spots on campus.\n\nUpon stepping into Sharetea, you're greeted with a vibrant atmosphere that effortlessly blends contemporary aesthetics with an inviting charm. The place is always bustling with activity, a testament to its popularity among students and tea aficionados alike. Despite the constant influx of customers, the staff here is remarkably efficient, working diligently to serve you your coveted cup of bubble tea in a timely manner.\n\nWhile there might be instances where you find yourself waiting for a brief period, the tantalizing drinks that await you are certainly worth the patience. Sharetea boasts an extensive menu that will leave you spoiled for choice. Whether you're in the mood for a classic milk tea or seeking a burst of fruity flavors with a vibrant fruit tea, this place has it all. Each drink is crafted with care and precision, ensuring a delightful and refreshing experience with every sip.\n\nWhat sets Sharetea apart is its commitment to quality. Each beverage is meticulously prepared using premium ingredients, resulting in a remarkable balance of flavors. The pearls, or boba, are consistently cooked to perfection, boasting a delightful chewiness that adds a textural element to every sip. Whether you prefer your pearls to be sweet, caramel-infused, or bursting with fruity flavors, Sharetea has got you covered.\n\nWhile Sharetea focuses solely on beverages, its dedication to perfecting the art of bubble tea shines through. The absence of food options, even as snacks, may seem like a limitation to some, but it only reinforces their commitment to providing an exceptional beverage experience. After all, it's all about the tea here, and Sharetea certainly excels in that regard.\n\nTo fellow tea enthusiasts, I cannot recommend Sharetea Bubble Drink at UBC enough. It's a haven for bubble tea lovers, offering a clean and modern space, prompt service, and an array of mouthwatering drink options. So, if you find yourself on campus and craving a delightful bubble tea experience, head over to Sharetea and let your taste buds embark on an extraordinary journey of flavors."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPPnxrML75hCtgIyxLvPFtciYusAAPbYMoAAHP8\u0026fid=0x0:0x706f1e599f8463a8""],""When"":""2023-7-13""},{""Name"":""Deborah Aiko Insook Kim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWkrXzRxO3A2OGqiLyPY_PlsYk2B44E-xgPkg6UAgy-1KwY7fkT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great place for milk tea lover!\nI found this place in UBC before and got a chance to sit in!\nCOVID-19 makes so much different for everythings.

Could be because the rose macaron was extremely sweet and made the other macaron taste relatively bland.\nThe mille feuille must have been out for a while because it was soggy and almost warm.\n\nThird, the atmosphere: Out of the many empty tables including the ones close to the counter, we were seated right by the washroom (...thanks?). The cutlery and plates were dirty (or perhaps they were going for an antique theme), and not once did any of the staff come to check if everything was ok (but perhaps they don't do that to any customers).\n\nOverall 2 stars because I reserve 1 stars for truly repulsive places.

The décor was lovely, and the whole place was so charming and intimate. It felt like we were there on our own, even though it was quite full.\n\nOur server, Estella, was exceptional and noted that we were celebrating a birthday on her own, and brought over a lovely treat to enjoy. Thank you, Estella! I don't get to see my family often, so your kindness and attentiveness were so appreciated.\n\nNot only was the selection of teas perfect (plenty to choose from, and fewer options than the Empress, but none of which were disappointing—opt for the Maple Peach if you enjoy fruit-flavored teas and thank me later—but the food was delicious and there was so much of it.\n\nFrom perfectly baked scones (with mascarpone tea cream and jam) to absolutely divine roasted turkey sandwiches, to sweet potato meringue tarts, everything was autumn-themed, delicious, and way more than we could possibly eat (we took plenty home with us). And at the end, the whole experience is even topped off with delicious macrons.\n\nWe also indulged in the cocktail offerings, and while all three were delicious, my preference was for the Pumpkin Spice Latte (my first of the season hah). This was such a lovely experience that we cannot wait to come back and try it again.\n\nIf you’re looking for a high tea experience like no other, then opt for high tea at Notch8!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPc-D5ARa_DzcYwrE2mV2C35U31iUJJe48xdzc\u0026fid=0x0:0x630ef77a3b6e5f20""],""When"":""2024-10-14""},{""Name"":""Steph N"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW-MJ4aq6rM8HEFO69oDw_npyeGHVzOuuaTAl9vMmfIrw-VaMbiCw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Booked out space for a high-tea team building experience.

Despite it being past her time, she graciously let us linger and enjoy our celebration. To top it all off, she surprised me with a cake and a candle when she found out it was my birthday, adding a personal and memorable touch to the experience.\n\nThe food was a culinary delight, especially the first two layers. We particularly enjoyed the exquisite fish and the delectable chicken sandwich on the middle layer; they were our absolute favourites. However, the sweet treats were not impressive and detracted from the overall experience. The only delicious sweet was my piece of chocolate birthday cake.\n\nThe room itself is a masterpiece, beautifully decorated to create an elegant and inviting atmosphere. The concept of high tea in collaboration with the art gallery is a fantastic idea. However, we were confused and a bit saddened to find that it did not include an entrance to the gallery. We had anticipated this as part of the experience and felt it would have added significant value.\nDespite these minor disappointments, Christine's exceptional service made our experience worthwhile.

Additionally, they didn’t add the sea salt caramel foam on top as expected (they don’t even offer this option) What’s more, when I tried ordering for pickup online and through the app, I couldn’t find this store, which was very strange to me. The taste was noticeably different as well. I’ve had the same milk tea three times this week, and this one tasted off compared to the others. I’ve attached pictures—it’s obvious to see the differences between the three bottles purchased from different places."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOfErjOPh1o21-ixDcDqbLX6PmDPfwatUdlTWXG\u0026fid=0x0:0x2b51fbafc18cdc0f""],""When"":""2024-9-29""},{""Name"":""Tony flader"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLEtGSpd-g_4J52pjNsyQ8WpUB7kC2XcKAyR0i2PDrQRQ4-pw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Had a rather unpleasant experience.

She just shakes her head and shuts the light off so she’s sitting in the dark to signal that they’re closed even tho it’s 12 mins before they’re unofficial closing time. I also went on Tuesday and my friend got a regular milk tea with Boba. The worker who wasn’t even behind the counter initially seals the drink before putting in boba so my friend says wait can I have boba (because the drink literally already comes with boba) he sighs super aggressively and then chucks the whole drink in the sink wasting it and making a mess. He then makes a new drink, correctly this time, with boba in it. Then I ask for my freaking mango slush and he goes we don’t have slush because we didn’t make any since there was no one here so you have to wait 30 mins. I just said no thanks and left.

The employee began yelling at us, saying that we should’ve specified our desired sweetness level and that it was our fault that the drink was not made correctly. I often visit different chatime locations and each time the workers ask what sugar and ice level i would like, as people frequently forget to include it in their order. However, as mentioned before, this worker did not even look at us. He began to escalate the situation and would yell over us when we tried to reason with him. This situation may have been more understandable if the cafe was crowded and he was busy making other drinks however IT WAS EMPTY. Eventually we asked for a refund for the drink as we were not satisfied. to that he said no and walked away, returning to his seat in the back of the cafe on his phone. this situation could’ve easily been avoided had he just remade the drink like we asked. I can only describe his appearance, as he would not disclose his name (for obvious reasons), as a tall asian with glasses and a mask.

The staff is really chill and friendly so the vibe is great, and the food/drink is good all around. In particular they have some of my favourite scones around. Their veggie sandwich is very very good (as long as you're prepared for your hands to smell like focaccia for the rest of the day). Except for during the summer, they have a daily soup which is always very tasty. The regular dessert pastries (brownie, cookies, dessert bars) are all good but not stand-out good, but they sometimes have fancier cakes which are amazing.\nFor their drinks, it is also really hard to go wrong. The masala chai latte is amazing - it's sweet but also richly flavoured with spices. The London fog is also very good. Both of these tea lattes use stone ground tea instead of brewed tea which I think contributes to the intensity. They do a great job with the matcha latte too - it's never clumpy at all. I used to be not the biggest fan of their coffee, but it's grown on me a lot. It's a bit on the acidic side, but if you don't mind that, then the flavour is pretty nice. I really like their mocha too (especially the peppermint mocha available in winter) - this is actually the only place where I really get mochas!\nThey have pizza nights now (7-10 Wed-Fri) where you can get a flatbread pizza big enough to feed two for less than $15. Only the very basic flavours available (margherita, bianca, or pepperoni), but super tasty (and cheesy).\nThe seating inside is limited and the space is so narrow that I find it very hard to be comfortable inside unless you go during a rare quiet hour, but I love the patio, which is huge and mostly covered.

My dad was one of his students.\n\nCheck lacuissoncafe.com for their menu.\nWe like their Croissants, salmon or ham. Panini and quiche are delicious too.\nFor the coffee, everyone's preferences may vary.\nIf you have tasted their coffee, you’re likely not willing to return to 7-Eleven or Starbucks.\n\nMy mom loves Latte. I had their regular Americano, Colombian, Santos, Kenya, Mandheling, Antigua, some Ethiopia and Java.. etc. or I just told Jason(or his staff) to make whatever you like to surprise me. Never disappointed. No idea what Blue Mountain tastes like since it's expensive.\n\nAll the homemade desserts were made by the owner's wife, Tina. You can see her on Saturday. I like their cheesecake.\n\nParking: you may park on the street or underground parking at London Drugs that is free for the plaza customers including those visiting this café.\n\nBtw, it’s a small business and they do have a minimum service charge. If you rate them a one-star solely due to the cafe policy rather than their food or atmosphere, that's not a genuine review.

the Stong’s Market in Dunbar is a rather unique collaboration between two well known Vancouver based food service businesses. Both of their commitments to providing excellent quality in both product and service makes even the prospect of a partnership of this sort exciting.\n\nAs someone who was rather unbeknownst to coffee and its intricacies, I was very impressed by the Baristas and their enthusiasm in providing me an avenue to learn about the different types of coffee and their makeup. Over the past couple of weeks I’ve gone through every coffee on the menu, and I believe I have a fairly good understanding of what’s on offer here.\n\nStarting with the atmosphere, it's rather slow in the mornings but ends up picking drastically as noon draws closer and closer. With it being located alongside a grocery store, it makes the day to day ambience rather chaotic, but I would say it's the good type of chaos, one that invigorates rather than debilitates. Options for seating include both outside patio seating with table, chairs and umbrellas included. Whilst the inside has both tables and chairs along with bar style seating. The whole vibe is rather casual, which is fine. Although if I was to give a critique, it lacks any special piece of decor that gives it true character or a distinct theme.\n\nThe quality of coffee is rather nice, the Cardamom Latte, Marrochino and French press are some of my personal favourites. The manager herself however, was quick to tell me that better coffee can be found elsewhere (not very supportive of the brand it seems…). That being said, I think it's certainly a spot worth exploring. Cost is what you’d expect with most coffee shops in Vancouver, 5 to 6 dollars for a regular coffee and up to 7 or 8 if you really go for something fancy. Not ideal but that’s the economy we’re currently in.\n\nService in my opinion, is unparalleled. There isn’t a day where the baristas aren’t responsive and friendly, although some credit can go to my natural charm in this regard. Coffee is delivered quickly with a small helping of cookies that you can nibble on. A small nitpick on the service side would be that the number of cookies provided seems to vary from 1 to 3, the factors that affect this variability are still unknown to me. Additionally, there is a tendency for a small contingent of the baristas to get excessively invested into a conversation. These however are small nitpicks to an ultimately exceptional service, for which all credit goes to the baristas and their manager."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""J.J.

The sandwich had slices of tofu, slaw, spinach, and soft cheese (I think it was melted cheese, maybe it was a spread) on fig sourdough. I liked that it was something a little different and healthful, and it was delicious (especially the bread), but it had been made in advance and the dressing had really soaked into the bread. The edges of the brownie were a little dry, but the middle was so good - it was fudgy but not overly rich. The matcha latte was very clumpy and the flavour was so-so, though the weak flavour is probably not because they used low-quality matcha but because it wasn’t fully incorporated. I would not get this again.\nMy total was $21 which is comparable to what I’d pay for a similar meal at chain coffee shops like Blenz or Artigiano. While there are certainly better coffee shops for food, this one was better than the competition at the price point. The food had that wholesome homemade quality that the big chains lack.

Finally stopped in to try their Indian food for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. I had the Kadhi Onion Pakora Chawal and it was so good. Nothing too fancy, but just excellent Indian comfort food. I’m not in a place to say whether Indian food is “authentic” or not, but this was not the relatively bland take on Indian food that you might expect from this unassuming brunch place, it was pleasantly rich. And the paratha was so soft and flaky! The portion was also very filling, so good value for your money. I like that the Indian section of the menu has so many (vegetarian) breakfast dishes that most Indian lunch/dinner restaurants don’t serve. I’m kind of curious about the Western brunch menu too, but will definitely be back to try more of the Indian food if nothing else.\nI had a Piña Colada smoothie too. It wasn’t bad, but it didn’t really do anything for me. They called this a “fruit smoothie” but it was so sweet and tasted closer to a flavoured slush to me. I'd skip the smoothie next time since the main meal was enough.\nThe atmosphere is totally bare-bones, it’s not sketchy or anything, there’s just absolutely no ambiance to speak of. The staff was nice enough though, especially the person taking orders at the front. It’s not a hip brunch place at all, but a great place for some no-fuss good eats.

this place... I visited two days in a row because I was really charmed. Good atmosphere, lots of natural light with one of those big windows that could roll up (even though it was closed, it still gave the place a more open feel), lots of seating, two levels which is interesting. Calming music. Mostly clean, but there were some flies in the bathroom - not a lot that I was seriously put off but enough that I noticed.\nThe baristas were very polite. The barista on my first visit very patient with all the customizations I was making on my drink. On my second visit, they messed up my order and made me something with a similar name but when I explained, they were nice about replacing it and even made a bigger size.\nThe drink menu is huge - they have bubble tea and unique drinks along with basic coffee and tea, a variety of pastries, and some light food. The bubble tea drinks are made \""from scratch\"" with real brewed tea instead of powders or concentrates so you can customize with nondairy milk. I got:\nGuacamole toast: Pretty simple, but good, like homemade food. Everything tasted very fresh. I think there was a little sprinkle of pepper which was subtle but made a difference in making it taste like a dish and not some stuff thrown together on bread. The price ($9) is a little steep for the small portion.\nCarrot walnut muffin: Standard carrot muffin. Soft and light.\nPistachio cookie: Very soft cookie with little dollops of frosting, a pistachio paste drizzle, and a sprinkling of pistachio pieces. Not too sweet. The pistachio paste drizzle was kind of skimpy but the small amount of frosting like a garnish was actually perfect - it was a very nice cookie by itself and more frosting would have been excessive.\nSakura oolong tea latte w/ red bean popping pearls: The tea was very good. I kind of expected a sweet sakura flavour but it wasn't sweet at all, which highlighted the fragrance of the tea itself. The red bean popping pearls were super interesting - not red bean-flavoured popping pearls but pearls with whole red beans inside. It was a cool and enjoyable texture with the combination of the pop and the chewy beans.\nOsmanthus Oolong Tea Latte: Very calming drink.

Place2be Cafe took over from Yet’s Cafe a little less than a year ago. This is an Indian cafe with lunch food like sandwiches and samosa and occasionally specials like chana and roti or idli vada, and chai, but they still have a small bubble tea menu.\nI tried the paneer masala sandwich, which is apparently the most recommended veg item, and a ginger chai. The presentation of the sandwich was very nice, topped with sev and with some ketchup for dipping on the side. It had melted cheese in addition to the paneer, so this is definitely one for cheese fans. Anyway, it was delicious - not really spicy, but with the intense masala flavour that I love and some green chutney to add some brightness. The chai was also great. I prefer mine without sugar so I was glad that they made it unsweetened and checked if I wanted sugar added. Together this was only about $10, making it one of the most affordable meals I've gotten downtown!\nAs lovely as the food was, it was equally nice to talk with the owner!

But if you were expecting manual labor in the form of someone literally punching limes with their fists to extract lime juice, then you're out of luck. Either way, it's a form of citrus abuse, is it not?\n\nBut I digress. They seem to have a steady rotation of seasonal drinks, which is always welcome. And of course, their prized Thai Lime Tea, which is a permanent fixture on their menu. At the height of Summer, they literally ran out of limes to make this drink, so that should tell you something.\n\nIndeed, this is without a doubt the best lime drink that I have ever had anywhere. Not that many bubble tea places offer lime drinks to begin with. However, considering the word \""lime\"" is literally in their storefront name, they'd better be able to back it up with the goods. And thankfully, they do deliver as promised.\n\nTheir Thai Lime Tea is a gorgeous emerald representation of the perfect blend of sweet and tart. If Summer could be turned into a delectable drink, this would be it. I like to flair it up with their Lychee Popping Boba, one of their 9 topping add~ons. Their Peach Black Tea is also really refreshing if limes aren't your cup of tea.\n\nFor a refreshing change of pace from the usual Passionfruit Green Tea, head over to Limegee and order something off their fixed menu.

The staff are very friendly and provide excellent service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN4q_myjUS5coXc6WzYz2UxfM-hb5p9D4fZPeDf\u0026fid=0x0:0x4a571cb4cb860102""],""When"":""2024-7-6""},{""Name"":""Kaitlyn Jung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU3Z8RTVAtMfrX6uG6JFFOYzsyTXI7YKgjW6WLd73YQIb_urJDkYQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We came during opening week and got the mango slush and a free small milk tea.

Suggested a friend to walk over to Coffee Bar as we made it a day to try different coffee shops in Gastown. Coffee Bar had been one of my favourite coffee shops to go to in Gastown in the past. Today we had to deal with a screaming lunatic who worked behind the counter. Aware of the no public bathroom sign, my friend needed the bathroom and I asked the staff asked if she can use the bathroom and while I chose a food item. I have multiple food allergies so needed time to decide what didn’t have dairy or gluten as there was not a lot of food options left, only pastries. Another worker was available to help and I let her know I needed time, yet she was quite persistent multiple times keeping her eyes on me  waiting for me to make my order quickly. I was deciding between the gluten free bar or trying something else, and the other “lunatic” staff glared at me and started shouting behind the cash register what I was going to order and that I needed to order. Shocked, I said I needed more time, and she said that I needed to order because my friend was using the bathroom and that I said I would buy something. I told her that I am allowed to take time to make a decision, but from her aggression I thought of how the service was already incredibly unprofessional, and was put off by her rudeness and lack of anger management skills. My friend came out of the bathroom and had taken her wallet out and said she would buy something too. I signalled to her we needed to leave because the staff was being aggressive. As we left, the “lunatic” chased and ran after us while behind the counter and screamed at us, screaming “YOU’RE A LIAR” repeatedly. Everyone in the cafe was startled by her screaming, and people outside the cafe was watching us get yelled at by this worker since my friend had already opened the door. The other worker with the red hair didn’t bat an eye or turn her head to the altercation. The lady screamed at us for a good 20-30 seconds, and my friend and I both exited the scene. We both work in the service industry and had never experienced anything quite like this, Buro literally has employed a mentally ill, unstable, violent staff.

First the dome is absolutely adorable and instantly puts you in the Christmas spirit. They have a heater inside to keep you nice and warm, as well as blankets. They also provided an iPad with Spotify where you can play any music of your choice, naturally we played Xmas tunes.\n\nOur server Curtis was amazing! He clearly knew the menu and provided wonderful service and recommendations throughout the night. He always made sure to check-in, but also let us have our privacy.\n\nThe cocktails are so fun here. They have a generic wine/beer list. But they also have a fun holiday menu with very unique surprises! I really enjoyed my drink the “Roller Skating to Church”. I’d best describe it as a boozey horchata. My friend also loved her “Santa’s Mailbox” and “Banana Tree” (think piña colada) drinks.\n\nThe food here was better than expected. I read some reviews ahead of time and was convinced I was going just for the dome experience with mediocre food, however that was not the case. I really enjoyed everything we tried, I will list below with my thoughts:\n\n*Mushroom \u0026 Tofu Dumplings - these were absolutely delicious with tons of flavor!! I would highly recommend!\n\n*Burrata - Very good, the burrata seemed very fresh and I loved the Chinese donut\n\n*Matcha Soba Salad (w/ smoked tofu) - this dish was very good! Surprisingly the tofu was the star, it reminded me of smoked Gouda\n\n*Sablefish - this is one of the best dishes I’ve had in a long time! The fish was cooked to perfection and the sauce on top was mouth watering. Even the side dishes were a star with the risotto and the chili crunch dashi eggplant. I’d come back again and again for this dish! This is an absolute must try!! ⭐️\n\n*Sautéed garlic \u0026 herb mushrooms (side) - big side dish with lots of flavor, very good\n\n*Maple spiced roasted vegetables (side) - again, a very generous sized serving for a side dish. These were very tasty\n\nOverall, this was such a wonderful dinner. I would highly recommend trying out the dome experience!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPTT3kkt0758o_St7AJINH6YbPCVttXLJj5Uojq\u0026fid=0x0:0xe51d75733323ba95""],""When"":""2024-12-21""},{""Name"":""Ania Kruger"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6eVZdvhgupxaSbVxtb48imUCLhn24LHkj73VeCMkgplnIwBg6=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Was really hopeful since the location is good and the service was excellent.

Vietnamese coffee and snacks. Inside feels like it could actually be a snack shop in Vietnam. The crate tables and plastic stools are probably not the most comfortable if you want to stay a while, but it’s a cool look.\nLots of drink choices on the menu. The person working offered to help me pick something but I had just made up my mind. I got a Thai green milktea with egg cream and a fried tofu bowl. The drink was really good, with high quality tea and a rich, not too sweet layer of egg foam. The egg foam was dusted with a little cocoa powder which also added some interest to the flavour. The fried tofu honestly would have been a little underwhelming (not that it was bad, just simple) if not for the delicious peanut sauce, which I could have and would have eaten with a spoon if I had a spoon on me. The tofu was very spongy inside, ideal for holding lots of sauce. This was pretty light, so I wouldn’t recommend if you’re really hungry, but it’s good for a light snack and not expensive.\nThere was a little bit of wait for the drink and a longer wait for the tofu even though I was the only person in the shop. The person at the register was very nice though.

You don’t see many Vietnamese snack and drink places around the Lower Mainland.

I had only ever seen one other restaurant serve this in Vancouver and the steep price at this other restaurant held me back from trying it. So I was pleasantly surprised to see it priced very reasonably here at Hem377.\n\nFor those who haven’t tried it, it’s more of a dessert drink as the egg makes it quite rich and could be called custard-like in taste. This is how I remember it from the cafes in Hanoi.\nThe version at Hem was served cold and was kind of like a milk shake in taste and texture. I’ll like to see if I can try it hot next time.\n\nAlso tried the Butter Corn with small shrimps. The small shrimps are the preserved and dried type so be forewarned if you don’t like those.\n\nOverall a nice first experience and looking forward to trying other menu items next time."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOw2ZuI4C_ihzba-lx03lhfhgkpglQuYgzFnM6_\u0026fid=0x0:0x2ebc57e52edd13e7""],""When"":""2022-12-6""},{""Name"":""Michelle Havvagoodey"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLOzetGkb5sfvQ2QqVQLz6HIVsUL94CClajRGhGVUfARW0O_A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""They have non-coffee options here too!

Not the hole-in-the-wall, greasy spoon that, for some reason, I was expecting, but clean and cozy, with walls adorned with photos of, what I assume to be, the proprietor's family...\n\nService was efficient and friendly, but don't recall that there was any follow-up/check-in after the food was served...a minor detail.\n\nThe food (a solid 3.5 but, unfortunately, no half-star ratings, so it's rated as a 3)\n\nMy wife ordered a Denver Omelette, which had two kinds of cheese:  aged Cheddar and Jack, together with ham, onion and peppers, served with 2 slices of a nice toasted sourdough bread, and homemade hash browns.  Omelette was not too runny, nor over-cooked, and not heavy-handed with salt...so no complaints.  Wife enjoyed the sourdough toast, which is surprising, as she is rather particular about her sourdough (that being said, she is going through withdrawals, as the bakery, where she religiously used to frequent to get her sourdough bread fix, has, very recently, closed 🥺).   Hash browns, fried with some onions  (green and red) and another fresh herb, rosemary perhaps, brought me back to childhood, as my parents/uncle used to prepare their hash browns in a very similar manner, although, in my humble opinion, it could have done with a bit more time of the griddle, as my preference is to have them more crispy...but, the flavours and taste were on point.\n\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict, 2 poached eggs served on an English muffin, with ham, topped with Hollandaise sauce, and a side of homemade hash browns.  It is one of my go-to, and favourite, breakfast dishes...cannot resist a dish which includes an English muffin, which provides a crispy, buttery base, with a Canadian bacon or ham, to add a salty, savory flavor, with a poached egg, to add a rich, creamy texture, tied together with the tangy, buttery-flavoured, gorgeous yellow hollandaise sauce...the eggs were poached perfectly, the ham was more luncheon meat style, but still tasty, but the unexpected colour of the Hollandaise was surprising...as well as the texture, a bit too runny.   The sauce was also, in my humble opinion, a bit too tangy, but still, overall, an enjoyable dish.  I don't believe I would re-order, though.\n\nVerdict:  This is definitely worth a return visit to try some of the other offerings."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPxWDsxpglrS5nspNdmB8peSjjv1AfIihBXrj2f\u0026fid=0x0:0x1153fae4043e7907""],""When"":""2024-8-31""},{""Name"":""Jennifer Nickerson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVBprpP7t61hDpnyo0fvCF1wERONJCYje2GJ3Egc9ktHWDcKVE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing little hole in the wall with extremely high quality food!

Next up we ordered a variety of savoury dine in items and pastries to go. Everything came in a timely matter. We ordered for savoury: Egg Sandwich (on a ka'ak bagel), Fattouch Salad (my favourite- not too sour from the pomegranate dressing and sumac), Salmon board (harissa hot honey labneh was delicious), and fluffy pita on the side with herb and garlic labneh. Fluffy pita was light and paired nicely with everything we ate. We got a variety of sweets to enjoy at home with some tea. The coconut cake is my absolute favourite, not too sweet  and super moist.Twiced baked concha, halva corn flake cookie, Osmalieh (Crunchy layers of kataifi with a milky filling and finished with pistachio.

It rivals chestnut filling. The bean filling is a good consistency, not overly dense at all. The piping on top is well done, and I was really impressed that the cream almost entirely did not stick to the plastic around the cake, so the shape was preserved when it was removed. The cake itself is on the dense side, but very moist in a good way. In comparison, Maxim's is much lighter (both are good), while T\u0026T's are too dry (bad).\n\nBut I do have some feedback for improvement: the green colouring was incredibly neon, and didn't match the website photos, which leaned more yellow and had a natural-looking shade. The cake itself was even more green than the whipped cream. Also, they did not have any bags that would fit the cake box, nor was the box tied up, so I had to carry it home like that through public transit. I'm really glad it wasn't raining! I still remember a few years ago, before the new location, the cake was too tall for the box and the lid couldn't fully close, but that time we had a car to pickup so it was ok. I'm a little baffled that the packaging situation isn't completely smooth by now. But the cakes are worth it! I need to come back next year for the mango cake, which I keep forgetting :)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOiW23UoBZaQpv8Q17DpO-Uo-4vsnxITuSEwatr\u0026fid=0x0:0xfecfa9324dd0d371""],""When"":""2024-11-18""},{""Name"":""Daniel Sung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ61DoMscspD7FnxbNGw4d3f5Af7KsUdL6bkhk3NlkyiWvRZg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Ordered my birthday cake because I saw this store on IG.

Few places can deliver this kind of atmosphere, and Batard absolutely nails it.\n\nI ordered an Americano, which was beautifully crafted with a thin, delicate crema that lingered on top which probably is coming from the oil of the freshly roasted coffee. The aroma was robust yet balanced, a true hallmark of expertly roasted beans. It was smooth, with no bitterness, making each sip incredibly enjoyable.\n\nTo complement the coffee, I tried the Apricot Vanilla Galette. Its crispy, buttery layers were perfectly baked, and the balance between the tangy apricot and subtle vanilla sweetness made it a treat worth savoring.\n\nI also took home a Salmon Coulibiac, which was phenomenal. The sockeye salmon, paired with mushroom ragout and a hard-boiled egg, was all wrapped in a golden croissant dough—a dish both indulgent and satisfying. Every bite felt like a harmonious blend of textures and flavors.\n\nI first got to know Batard because a friend gifted us a box of their pastries. While I initially found those selections too sweet for my palette, today I was delighted to discover a wide variety of offerings, catering to different tastes. The exterior of the boulangerie was so inviting, like stepping into Paris, and I’m thrilled I gave it another chance.\n\nThere’s so much more to explore here, and I’m already planning my next visit to try more of their unique creations since I pass through Fraser every time I’m on my way to work.

Although I've never been to France, the atmosphere felt authentic to me. There's a decent amount of seating inside and it was still packed while I was there, about 2:30-3:30 on a Saturday. There are a few tables outside, which are under an awning but don't quite give you total coverage in the rain, so not ideal if it's raining... but I sat out there anyway because I was determined to eat there and didn't have a plan B, and didn't really mind getting a little wet.\nI got an eggplant parm croissant, a slice of pumpkin espresso bundt cake, and an iced ginger green tea. The croissant had buttery flavour but wasn't greasy to the touch, beautiful flaky layers, and the eggplant filling was delicious. The cake slice was huge - I cut it in half and took half home, but it was so good and not too heavy, I probably could've just eaten the whole thing if I hadn't put that second half away before I started. The flavour was perfect. The iced tea was also nice and refreshing.\nThe 2 pastries and tea came out to about $15, around $5 each, which I thought was a great price for this because it was all top quality and as mentioned the slice of cake was fully two servings."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPClSdq2XZL8APXIHsr-se-3XO4KogRSUlUfvyO\u0026fid=0x0:0x94d3acfe7a9a3a79""],""When"":""2024-10-20""},{""Name"":""Shonnah"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVryghpg_5X3Yv-cncwU7OGN26KCAvVhjXajvFLZ6BLUMNFRgyF=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I’ve heard many great things about this bakery and finally managed to visit. Upon entering, I was surprised to see how many consumer goods they sell - it’s a mix of their own products, local venders and specialty items. I came around Sunday noon and the place was pretty packed, but the line-up moved relatively quickly.\n\nWe dropped by for a quick snack - we ordered the raspberry cheesecake danish and the cheese tomato galette. Honestly, they were both great. The danish was flakey and buttery as it should be, yet the cheesecake part wasn’t overwhelmingly heavy or sweet. It had a mild creamy taste, where most danishes I have typically use custard. The fresh raspberries made it a bit more refreshing as well. It’s definitely a light treat for someone who doesn’t pastries that are indulgent, rich and too sweet, similar to myself. As for the galette, the dough was much simpler and the tomato was the game changer. Without it, it’s an average cheese bun (lack of a better word), however the slice of tomato that was baked in it made it similar to a grilled cheese with tomato soup in bun form - a great combo.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience here and would definitely come back to try their brunch and coffee. I can definitely see why this place is a hit."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN_ZRZXV89Q_0UfrIOg-p2U7U-0HYts7_vsQjaz\u0026fid=0x0:0x94d3acfe7a9a3a79""],""When"":""2024-8-27""}]",

Even if you don't put a lot of meat, at least fill it up with pickled diakon and carrot. There was just a single strand of cilantro.\n\n-edit-\nThe manager reached out to me to issue a refund. I have changed the rating to reflect this proactive-ness.

They always came with 2 bags, one for the drinks and one for the foods. The waffles have their own bags and one bigger outside. This time I ordered for pick up and they only gave me 1 bag for the drinks and they stapled the waffles bags together. The bags are quite thin and it’s raining so hard. When I came home, one of the bags almost  broken. A male staff comment that “it’s cruel to staple like that” but the girl who’s doing my order ignore that.

My partner and I enjoyed a memorable dinner for two in this beautiful establishment. The ambiance is simply stunning, with dim lighting that exudes warmth and an old-school charm enhanced by white linen tablecloths. It's the perfect setting for a special evening.\n\nThe service was impeccable from start to finish. The staff was polished, friendly, and incredibly well-versed in the menu, ensuring we were well taken care of throughout our meal. They constantly replenished our fresh bread and water, and the dishes were promptly cleared after each course, allowing us to fully enjoy every moment.\n\nNow, onto the food! We indulged in the rack of lamb, which was cooked to perfection, and the lobster tartare, a delightful treat bursting with flavor. The herb-crusted fish was another standout, showcasing the kitchen's expertise. Each dish was beautifully presented and incredibly delicious.\n\nWhile Bacchus is on the pricier side, the quality of the food and the overall dining experience make it worth every penny. If you're looking for a fancy night out with exquisite cuisine in a charming atmosphere, Bacchus is the place to be. We can’t wait to return!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPZ-5J6bGjKwHNdCISYvrmQOhdZhgATzAJWDwi1\u0026fid=0x0:0xa630a9701b4ea29f""],""When"":""2024-12-9""},{""Name"":""Ben M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLY7-DFsqx-InW5CnlXpJd6DWvP1u6nfShJnLWMiHPMX_9EZw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Lovely ambiance and excellent service.

The service that we received from the receptionist (the one who had her hair down on duty during Christmas Eve 2024) and the waitress who served us that evening were just horrible and not at par with the service that other five star restaurants we go to like Le Crocodile, Giardino, Five Sails and Blue Water provides. Please change your servers and receptionist. Horrible! Just read the other review from Mr. Rowe. We had the same horrible experience from the staff — haughty, snobby, zero service skills! We are not after freebies. We just want the owner to know this. Please read other reviews. Even the doormen have attitude. The Filipino doorman/guy has an attitude. The other Caucasian guy on duty during Christmas Eve December 24 at 8:30pm also has bad attitude. Please train them better or hire others who are more service oriented.

Nothing special to say as it was typical egg and spinach crepe that was decently seasoned.\n\nThe chicken crepe had butter chicken pieces, red onion and tomatoes.

This year is already completely reserved and the spots do tend to fill up fast so I will anticipate being much quicker about it next year. I’ve also had the pleasure of tasting several of their pastries aside from afternoon tea, and it is extremely delicious.

I’ve found that the early morning staff is super sweet but the attitude of the afternoon staff is a toss-up. The convenience is the main draw. They have Upmeals entrees and UBC-issue bake goods. The Upmeals stuff is healthy and easy on the palate but interesting. In the past I’ve found that even some of the fresh baked goods somehow came out tasting stale, but this year’s iteration of UBC baking seems better. They’ve also instituted a Pearl Fever “pop-up” where you can get a limited selection bubble tea here (which is good, although I’ve only tried the jelly, which is harder to mess up than pearls) and also ice cream with taiyaki (the waffle is good, the soft serve is just okay - little icy - but it’s an accessible way to experience a fun dessert that’s a little hard to find).\nMy experience with the espresso drinks is - and I only drink decaf, so this may or may not be representative - it’s not awful, but it does taste a little over-roasted. Sometimes adding milk can mellow out bitter coffee but this one basically tastes the same in americano or latte form. The chai is not offensive but is made from a concentrate that’s very sweet and the London fog is also very sweet. Be careful because the hot drinks come out intensely hot. If you just need a coffee or tea, this will do the job, but definitely go somewhere else if you’re a coffee snob.\nAt peak studying hours, it’s crowded, but at off hours, the clean, quiet environment is very relaxing.\nGood place for students/UBC-people if you want a break from heavy food or fast food, not the place I’d necessarily recommend to campus visitors."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPCIoyH-0sdLvK7eGkdXRaADKQuUnvNnYAN71NY\u0026fid=0x0:0x38c96d30bcb01b2f""],""When"":""2023-8-29""},{""Name"":""Oakley Nance"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWwVuB38LSpIWv_yGP7nRej-Jw5m59HC-jukdf9PfQxIccZsQIsjA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I was the only person in line, i ordered and had to clarify my friends drink order, the bubble was literally typing as I was ordering and the lady asked if the drink was iced or hot.

This location of Tim’s has the best staff by far out of all other Tim’s I frequent. However we must address the corporate level issues on the food. I just ordered 2 hash browns and they were not palatable. They tasted freezer-burned and were barely warm. Even if they were warm enough that frozen freezer burn taste would still be there. They are clearly the same hash browns we can all buy in the frozen food isle and they have that same frozen taste when we make them at home- so we know. You think this is acceptable to charge people for? Why do McDonald’s hash browns taste so amazing? And made in a way we cannot replicate at home. I ate one of my hash browns today and it was so gross, I took one bite out of the second and could not believe I was charged $2 each for this frozen tasting not edible food. I went to the counter to complain and explain but instead of hearing what I was saying they just offered me 2 more hash browns- that made me angry enough to complain in this way. Your food is unacceptable now and barely edible and when people are honest and complain about it they should get a refund- not more inedible freezer burn-tasting replacements.

I would really recommend any of the cooked meals including the butter chicken and chicken stroganoff or the hot sandwiches such as the club sandwich or the roast beef sandwich.

Parking is underground from the rear lane.The main difference I found is this location does not have as much ready-to-eat options as Aberdeen which makes sense as it is not as big. H-Mart is interesting, being a Korean-American chain, in that it carries products made in Korea, Japan, and China. If you cannot read the symbol language, just check on the front or back for 'Made in xxx'. For example, in one of my pictures you can see Japanese Style Somen made in China. There are always some surprises especially with snacks/sweets-Peach Oolong Oreos?! I am a fan of the Kirin Kitchen drinks and H-Mart is one of the few stores I can find the Salty Lychee drink.\nThe proteins are very good, especially the meat. We often buy thin sliced beef for Korean and Japanese dishes. The quality and style of meat/trimming is worth the cost. The variety of kimchi is great of course-I did not know there were so many options. We buy a lot of Japanese dry food and Japanese condiments from H-Mart. They also carry beauty products/toiletries, along with small appliances.\nSo rule of thumb is check 'Made in xxx' before you buy, if that matters to you. You could buy each product in country-specific supermarkets but it is nice to have products all in one store.\nDaniel"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOx7yx_2FEXGDKr95QOegzUQTMlqvxEtKCOKSH3\u0026fid=0x0:0x200638e1d0588cdd""],""When"":""2021-1-6""},{""Name"":""Deborah Aiko Insook Kim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWkrXzRxO3A2OGqiLyPY_PlsYk2B44E-xgPkg6UAgy-1KwY7fkT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""This Korean mart is pretty useful place for Asian foods.

According to them, a photograph of your More Rewards card is fine! These people should know, they ARE the More Rewards Customer Service team.\n\nWhat I find most disappointing is the fact that the policy of how a More Rewards card is accepted is left to the discretion of the store manager and then to the cashier. In my experience, this is all decided upon by the Marketing team in the corporate head office and is completely removed form the managers hands. UNLESS the store is owner / operator, then that is a completely different story. Somehow, I don't feel this is the case in this store.  (if I'm wrong, correct me). If I'm not wrong - keep reading (if you like).\n\nAccording to the store manager, a physical card is best.  This becomes one more card taking up space. While I realize this card can be loaded to Apple Wallet, I'm not crazy about this idea (am I alone?). I know I can provide my phone number, but I feel this is fringing on an invasion of privacy (perhaps this too is just me?)\n\nThe reason for the lack of acceptance of a picture? \""...it is best to present a physical card at check out, as cashiers typically refrain from accepting pictures of cards due to concerns about potential fraud.\""\n\n*blink...blink* Alright....this isn't saving points to cash in on a TV (Club Z). But I appreciate this program adds up to tens of thousands of dollars  in a very short period of time. If there are concerns, why offer a points system to reduce the cost of groceries?\n\nI wonder what \""fraud\"" they are concerned about?\n\nIf the fraud is people entering too many times on the random draws, the fastest way to cut that off at the knees: one registered number and name = one entry. Everyone with a More Rewards number gets a single shot and by random draw, someone wins. There are no benefit to multiple entries (or registered cards).\n\nIf the fraud is the accumulation of points themselves, then drop the program yesterday! Reduce the price of groceries and stand on your own merits as a chain of grocery stores: good products (I've seen produce rotting), good prices, phenomenal selection, and stellar customer service. In my opinion, these are all middling at best.\n\nIf the fraud is the sharing of numbers - If I were to give my physical number to a friend, they get the reduction in groceries, I get the points.  If anyone reading this really thinks about it, there is absolutely no difference from me going to the store with my friends shopping list, me buying their groceries, and them paying me back.  My friend still has the reduction in their groceries, I still get the points.  So really - fraud??  Sorry, but give me a break!\n\nSo, currently, at the end of the day - does it matter?  I guess it depends on which side of the coin you're on.  As a customer, I'm looking for the most convenient and easy shopping experience.  and if this means my More Rewards card happens to be a picture on my phone, and this is both convenient and easy, will I be leaving the store a happy customer? Most likely, yes.  If I'm nit-picked over a picture vs a physical card, will I be leaving the store a happy customer? Likely not.\n\nWhen I worked as a cashier, my objective was to get the customer gone and leaving happy! I wasn't paid enough to argue - you have a picture? Fine. It's 1 item / customer or a limit of 6 / household and a whole family is shopping? Fine - it's one transaction, Why? I wasn't paid enough to care and it sped things up!\n\nSo, since the Dunbar location seems to leave it's policy making to their cashiers, do I feel comfortable shopping in that store? No.  Why? If policy around the More Rewards card is being left to the the cashier to interpret, a cashier could decide to stop accepting Debit cards one day. Is this extreme? Yup! But if policy around points is seemingly being left to the cashiers to determine - there is no telling what I might encounter in this store by way of what is acceptable."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOJUTkNgJA4nxmXtQwn04azXP760GO5ODjGOudz\u0026fid=0x0:0xbeb7afdd4f414822""],""When"":""2024-11-22""},{""Name"":""Quinlan Wu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWXtir1TIhXtrXs42qhGyMeP1MyxlX1QlEzn4MMLzJAGFbEIMNudQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Was checking out my groceries with one of the cashiers who was a very polite Asian woman.

I remembered clearly at the time of ordering to check for their closing hours to be sure that I can pick it up on time and that they weren't closing early for X'mas (both the Google hours and their main website said at the time of ordering that their store closes at 7 pm/ regular hours so I proceeded with ordering).\nWhen I got to the Richmond store on Dec 24th at 4:15 pm, I then realized from the sign posted outside their door that they actually closed at 4 pm. I want to thank the staff that they still opened the doors after hours when I knocked, thank you to one of the ladies who called her manager to let her know about the situation and thankfully, in the end, I was able to still pick up the order but I want to raise a few concerns here:\n1) I would not have ordered from Paragon if I knew ahead of time that they were closing early or I would have arranged someone to pick up for me. I have done my due diligence to check for their holiday hours on the day of placing the order. Their holiday hours should have been posted on their main website given that they have an online ordering system on this site and they have order pick up available on xmas Eve (even until today, Dec 24th, the holiday hours aren't posted). The hours on google were not updated until the day of. The receipt also does not indicate pick up deadline. I raised this concern to the staff at pickup that their hours aren't updated and her response was that this is posted on Instagram. There shouldn't be an assumption that all their customers follow  their Instagram or that their go-to would be to check Instagram for their hours, especially when there is a store website and the Instagram account is not the first link that is attached the Google business page. I could not find a phone number to call either to give them a heads up or inquire what to do in this case.\n2) It would be appreciative if the staff could have called the customers who did not pick up their orders (or even called 30 min before closing which some other stores would have done) or sent an email regarding this which will highlight more professionalism here. When asked about this, the staff answered that they have too many orders to call the customers (which is interesting because do they have many orders left behind by customers who do not pick up their order for the day they ordered for).\nIn summary, I still want to thank the staff for taking their time for helping me but I hope the store understands the frustration for a customer who is trying to rush from work and hoping to gift the cookies for an X'mas dinner. This could be handled with better customer service and professionalism."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPp2nBWzmJi7dbcF5UHsZFQaWmDwVsqNjavRLr3\u0026fid=0x0:0x2a1f74f49a19358d""],""When"":""2024-12-25""}]",

The tea was barely steeped and I was given a cup of what looked to be milk with no tea colouring. I ended up giving it back and asking for it to be redone. After a bit of arguing (!!) — they should’ve been so embarrassed to give me essentially a cup of milk in the first place — they gave me a slightly better version but again the tea was barely steeped and the London Fog was not made to standards.

It felt like the cafe was severely understaffed, and her rushing attitude reflected it. She seemed unprofessional, unfriendly, and definitely not happy with her job - probably due to the stress of managing multiple tasks on her own.\n\nWhile the space itself is nice, the tables are packed closely together, making it hard to have a quiet moment or get work done without overhearing everyone else’s conversations.

However, the pastries looked incredibly fresh and inviting. We ordered the double-baked almond croissant, the chocolate orange morning bun and a shot of espresso.\nEvery bite was delightful—the pastries were perfectly crisp, with just the right level of sweetness.

Interior is a vibe, staff are so sweet, and the lot has 45 mins free parking (just register at the machine). Now for the baked goods:\n\nKouign Amann - Always one of my favourite pastries and they sure make a good one. Due to how sweet they are these could be an acquired taste for some, but they definitely work for me.\n\nCinnamon Bun - Officially my #1 in Vancouver. Icing is more cream cheese-y than sweet. You can taste the 100% real butter and how lovingly this was made from scratch. Worth many return trips. PS. It didn’t just survive but THRIVED after a second day re-heat.\n\nPesto Scroll - Biggest surprise of the bunch! The flaky layers and fragrant pesto came together to make something truly magnificent. One of my favourite savoury pastries ever. Also ate half on the 3rd day (illegal I know) after re-heating and it was still fab.\n\nMorning Bun - First, this thing is huge. Second, if you like the caramelized crust of a Kougin Amann but also desire the flaky butteriness of a croissant, this pastry is pretty much it. So good.\n\nCroissant - Not the best shot but this was an absolute unit of a croissant. Exterior flakier than your average Vancouverite, interior pillowy soft, though it could have been just a HINT more buttery for me. Tied with 1-2 other bakeries for #1. Doesn’t come with icing, I accidentally lay it on the cinnamon bun lol.\n\nKouign Amann Crunch - These are crunchy but don’t hurt, caramelized but not bitter, sweet but not too sweet. This bakery has brought balance to the (pastry) force with this snack. 100% recommend."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPYMpdPoNo0V8rrLdUQP0VE0Ay3PjDZ1zXRelyJ\u0026fid=0x0:0x86d8327517f99ebd""],""When"":""2023-4-11""},{""Name"":""Kim N"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbdjDpWyXnvjc80j1Uggeb1c_m_wfTt6lOvg1Z_TeE5AinsEnY=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We tried 3 items.

Brad and team are serving up an amazing rotation of seasonal comfort food that will knock your socks off — skip the brunch lineup and walk right into this spot for dinner most nights of the week!\n\nLast night we had an **amazing** in house made French-style pate/terrine, following by a Caesar salad (complete with house smoked lardon), then we shared the steak frites with brined peppercorn + the pork cheek bourguignon — the pork cheek, just added to the menu, quickly became the STAR dish to fight over when sharing.\n\nPrior to this visit I had the smash burger and the bistro (wet) burger and both were fantastic. I will put red wagon’s burgers up against any Vancouver burger establishment (I’ve tried them all) for the WIN. My take is that they aren’t trying to copy other’s burgers styles and are just having fun bring you what they like so you can join them in burgerville.\n\nAlso a wicked cocktail and beer selection, and I haven’t even mentioned the dessert. Butterscotch custard is one of my favs but the creative assortment of milkshakes will always set you straight too.\n\nSo… go support a real local business, put your money in a real neighborhood and real local team, and be happy eating awesome food made from scratch that leaves you feeling fully satisfied and is still worth the $$ value!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM60BgUDdb6bpFd-96TeEqtBrbunM0r5CVEihsH\u0026fid=0x0:0x6075da54d0f16636""],""When"":""2024-10-19""},{""Name"":""Alex Y."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKw6vbDp2wwnwGTgY3u4AHRVGKyyIunXuhDwQ_GXEbd3GqTyiat=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I finally got the chance to have breakfast here and it did not disappoint.

The aroma of freshly baked bread fills the cozy space, making it feel like a little slice of Italy right on Commercial Drive. My panini was packed with flavor, and the coffee was smooth—an excellent pairing for a morning treat​.\n\n🍅 LIVIA is more than just a café; it’s a charming bakery and wine bar that offers a delightful range of Italian treats, from fresh sourdough to homemade pasta. On our second visit, we enjoyed a Negroni Americano along with brunch and pasta—each dish was a joy to savor. Their emphasis on quality ingredients really shines through in every bite​.\n\n🌞 The ambiance is warm and welcoming, perfect for a relaxing brunch or lunch. It’s easy to lose track of time browsing their pastry selection or chatting with the friendly staff who are always ready with a recommendation. The outdoor patio is a nice spot to enjoy some sunshine while you sip on an espresso.\n\n🍷 Overall, LIVIA Forno e Vino offers a taste of Italy with its fresh, quality offerings and charming vibe. Whether you’re stopping by for coffee, a meal, or just a snack, it’s a must-visit.

The brown sugar pearl is the highlight of the milk tea drink—soft, chewy, and perfectly cooked. They have one of the best pearls and I hope it will be consistent because we will be back.\n\nThe mango slush with cheese foam is another must-try, made with fresh mango blended with jade tea. The natural sweetness and light tea infusion make it incredibly refreshing.\n\nFinally, the fruit tea is a masterpiece—packed with real fruit like passion fruit, pineapple, apple, and orange.

My orders: 1 Green Curry Lunch Combo 2 Pad Thai.  The lunch combo comes with a green salad and a spring roll. I absolutely love their spring rolls. Thin skin and rice vermicelli fillings. The green curry my favourite😍. Rich coconut cream, very milky and just a hint of the spice. Chicken strips and veggies are nicely cooked and soaked in the sauce. Goes so well with 🍚 rice, I finished all of them easily😁 Pad Thai tastes also good! They are sweeter than I expected, I can tell there are some tomato flavour in it.

From outside I thought it was just a cafe serving coffee, tea and cafe foods. In fact they serve Thai cuisine for their lunch menu and the quality really impressed me.\n\nThe customers in the cafe are generally the people who have been living in Kerrisdale for decades. Many of them are now over 75 years old and they are the loyal customers who visit the cafe every morning. As a new face to the people, I was warmly welcomed. The customers know each other like family members. The vibes made me feel like home there. In particular they don't play any background music - I really like it!\n\nRegarding the foods, the super breakfast and a cup of latte are definitely the good choices for a chilly morning. In my last visit at lunch I ordered their Yellow Curry Chicken with rice. The curry was very tasty and I love it from my first bite. The taste is authentic and I must say it is better than authentic. I should have a larger portion of rice as the curry sauce went well with the jasmine rice.\n\nThis is a cafe full of nice people with stories and good foods where you can slow down and enjoy the moment."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMFv8oH_FTrdyS4SQHN8qhNb14WHlcb7eniXYI\u0026fid=0x0:0xe2a9207bf5e23816""],""When"":""2022-12-12""},{""Name"":""kawaii hatchiko"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWLtom4JJghW2UnkOsI7GKr-J96yxZfSX4SBdkTaAQaNBfKVBVT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Ordered here for the first time.

When I finally got here, I was a bit confused because the place looked like a coffee shop (not a Thai restaurant).\n\nAs it turns out, however, they do have a full Thai menu inside the shop and we wound up ordering the Sampler Platter ($15.99) as well as Green Curry Chicken ($13.99) and Pad Thai ($12.99). This appetizer platter was really good and had all of the items that we enjoy… spring rolls, chicken satay, fish cakes, shrimp cakes, and deep-fried prawns.\n\nThe green curry chicken is exactly what you’d expect from a full Thai restaurant and had tender eggplant, bamboo shoots, red and green peppers, and Thai basil leaves. As expected, the curry sauce goes very well with a bowl of white rice.\n\nThey use tamarind sauce in their pad thai (instead of ketchup) and this version turned out pretty good.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food in this little coffee shop. Service, while adequate, was a little bit more in line with what you’d expect at a coffee shop than at a sit-down restaurant (we had to seat ourselves and also flag them down to order and get take-out containers and then pay up front at the cashier).

There are some cookies, muffins.\n\nAll in all, if you can taste different beans then this is going to be a treat heaven for you.\nIf you literally just want a coffee on the go, go to any chain coffee shop will suffice."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP4vICEc_IntK9A7Z397qWWG--UWYOhg8UNIWw\u0026fid=0x0:0x93c53e6d216b1f62""],""When"":""2024-2-24""}]",

The egg in the sandwich was a little undercooked (the white was still kind of runny in places) but otherwise it was a good sandwich, very good brioche bun. The lemon thyme brownie was great!

We picked the Chocolate and Matcha Waffles 🧇\n- Drink: Fairy Rose Milk Tea Cold and Vanilla Lavendar Lattee Cold\n- The store was quite open concept and had decent music on.\n\nPros:\n- Won't be a bad place to study, but it has limited seats overall. Probably roughly 10 tables 📖\n- Waffle was really yummy, I personally liked the Matcha since it was nice and fluffy, and if you look at my photo, you can see the waffle texture. 🧇\n- My partner liked the chocolate waffle, which had bits of chocolate pieces.\n- Both waffles weren't sweet, which really made it worth it for us.👌👍\n- The Fairy Rose Milk Tea, I liked it as I could taste the rose flavoring, but my partner didn't like much as it was more milky. If you like milky with rose flavoring, then give it a try ~\n\nImprovements/comments:\n\n- I think investing in menu per table would be better as people can sit and order. The reason for this is that guest can order whole sitting and can add onto their overall order.\nInstead of paying right at the door with the TV menu.\nMy partner and I would have been more inclined to order another batch of waffles if we hadn't paid beforehand.\n- There was only 1 person during this time, and maybe it would be hard to do this, but the likely of someone ordering more is easier than paying everything first, in my opinion.\n- The chairs are okay. If you are wearing shorts, just pick another chair as it can cause lines on your back legs.\n\nOverall, I won't mind going back again and would recommend trying the place out 😊\n\n-J approved."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOK7RCicdjKvXr8PbNDTnjGvhu_HPvG-cR0yOHw\u0026fid=0x0:0x99d5cb2d2a7625d3""],""When"":""2023-6-12""},{""Name"":""Yuen Tso"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLGxQe3CGkaLkRsj4mn2zb12RFye96G7s1qoZk2obkll8HdPJM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""It’s a shame they charge a cup fee on uber eats and door dash when it should have ended on may 1st 2023 hasn’t been fixed still .

Once I ordered a tall dark, after taking the order, she will spend about 30 to 40 seconds talking to her coworker and then start making the drink.  Once she was done making another customer's drink, she was still chatting with that customer.  I had to interrupt the conversation so she will serve me.  I see her making drinks, she will stop for a bit and chat, then start making the drink and then chat again.  Starbucks is paying her to make drinks and to serve customers.  Not to socialize.

If you’re looking for an inexpensive little date idea, don’t sleep on their live music nights for a fun, cozy, and casual (but still very interesting and cool) date night.

I am happy to see a Trees pop up in my neighbourhood since I really like their other cafes.\nI stopped in to check them out early Wednesday morning and enjoyed a cranberry pecan muffin and matcha latte. The matcha was fine - the actual powder used is probably about average quality, but the latte was made very well. The muffin was fantastic, though, very fresh and soft with a little bit of buttery flavour. The Trees food and drinks have never failed me before so everything is as expected here.\nThis new location is very inviting with the interesting levelled layout (there is a ramp for accessibility).

But I know hojicha doesn't taste like this. I then saw they had a banana cream flavor and realized it must have been mixed in. I told the staff and they were quick to replace it. The new one tasted much better. Very creamy and rich and no gross banana taste.

But i feel than i really need to leave this review if i hoping to see a change.\nI’m really rare client of this place and reason why is - staff.\nSince first time i visited this place i didn’t feel nor welcome nor comfortable at all.\nEvery time i visited this place i was hoping “maybe this time they will be more welcome and nice” but i feel like it’s only gets worse.\nToday it was to the point to write this review.\nSo i came to take a lot of deserts and try a bubble waffle with ice cream. When i started to tell what i would like to order i got a half-dead look as a “what are you doing here”. I just tried to ignore it tho it wasn’t look welcome at all. When he didn’t get clearly what i would like to order he didn’t seem to try solve the problem or recommend me something he just the same half dead face and tone “we serve it with matcha only”(i asked if i could have a twist ice cream in waffle) Ok no problem. I ordered this and i started to order other desserts, he didn’t hear what am i ordering or got confused.. i don’t know honestly but he just was looking at me around 5 second before he said that “we don’t serve any fruit tart” which was literally before me. Ok he finally find the fruit tart, which was in front of me. after what he asked me what i was ordering before because he heard nothing from ~3 my orders. Ok i just repeated it, but problem is not in incompetence, he was really like a person who wants go home or wants me to leave this place to not bother his with any orders. He had this face like, he wasn’t even look tired, it was just dead face. I had no any smile or interest to help me as a client. I work in a service and i know what i’m talking about. When you work in a service you must be interested in your production, your clients and be able to smile at least for 1%. I ordered desserts for 50$ it’s not like i took one cupcake and i wanted to have at least a little smile since i really love your food and for stuff is good if i’ll come back to buy some desserts again (if i enjoy all aspects of service) The final hit was also “dead”-tone, dead face “we are closing in 10min ” while we were talking and eating. It’s really had to explain in a text because it’s really about your tone and voice.\nHonestly when i need to say it to my guests i feel very sorry for interrupting them and i trying to say it as soft as possible to not make them feel unwelcome. I really have no clue how people like him can work in a SEVICE. If you unable to find ways to talk with people just do not go work in a service.\nI’m not interested in delivery so only one way is not to visit this place until they change stuff or train people how to work in service and how to make a comfortable atmosphere for guest. Not an atmosphere when you wanna drop your idea to order something in a middle of this order and want to leave as soon as possible. I never had any problem with owners, they really nice when i was able to meet them in the cafe. But stuff 🥲 Please do not consider it as an attack, i really feel that it is time to tell it after i visiting this place for a year."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM0O-8n1jOGANr8A7XnNPkSsX6SV8EFGhm0vI80\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c695dfac860f6ba""],""When"":""2024-7-23""},{""Name"":""Chloe Chloe"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIb0YSa6wZyDpN6F0vZFHOWjsTJMmhw-oInA8MulhfzrZVG9A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""ordered a strawberry matcha latte. tbh it's bad, but if you don't like sweet, you may like trying their drinks. they have a condiment bar tho so you can always add more sweetness to your drink.

I also got a sample of the apple pecan power muffin! I could’ve used more pronounced flavours in both the strawberry goat cheese muffin and coffee - for my taste, they both had a little too much sweet and not quite enough substance, but the base concept was good. The apple muffin sample was less sweet. It was nice to have the strawberry muffin warmed for me. The prices are about average.

The environment they've created here is everything you could want from a community cafe. I was made to feel so welcome from the first time I walked in, and since then the baristas have cared enough to remember me, learn my name, ask how I'm doing/what I'm up to and follow up on it the next time I'm back, which is sometimes a month or more later. I've really never been to a coffee shop where the baristas show such genuine interest in customers. I'm not naturally very outgoing so I usually don't really get to know staff at cafes that I frequent, but it's not like I feel like these people are forcing me to converse with them, they're just really nice and it is infectious!\nAs wonderful as the people are, I wouldn't be coming back over and over again if the food wasn't equally as wonderful, but it absolutely is. Their baked goods are homemade and it's very evident in the quality - everything tastes so wholesome! The sandwiches and wraps are great - the Big Veg sandwich, my favourite, is a killer vegan option. And they make good drinks too. The espresso drinks are pretty standard but brewed strong (but not TOO strong), and I think all the tea drinks (including the tea lattes and just straight-up tea) are excellent.\nThey offer a lot of variety in the menu. It's not a vegan cafe (there are plenty of meat options) but there are some very good options for vegans: an assortment of vegan baked goods and two vegan sandwiches. They whip up new things from time to time.\nIt's pretty small inside but they have a lot of patio space for when the weather's decent. They have blankets you can use to keep warm. It’s colourful and cozy inside and the patio has a rustic garden feel."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMUySRpH_ueSN6bY6_vvv34SZavpRmj0zn_5SYI\u0026fid=0x0:0x68758ce5f8b95cf7""],""When"":""2024-3-23""},{""Name"":""Tiara"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXOGTnVSprrRfKnl8HxlMWqGPfK-EAnduRxsmD5lBjFitcsiWe8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Small cafe that was really nice!

Because they fell in love with Las Vegas Bellgio’s almond croissant and this was the closest thing to it in Vancouver at the time. I’m glad they opened another branch in Mount Pleasant recently. My brother-in-law loves their macarons. I am now a big fan of their trio chocolate mousse cake! The pistachio hot chocolate (to which I added a shot of decaf espresso to make it into a mocha…) had a very strong almond extract flavour which I prefer not to pair with pistachio. Their chocolate bon bons are decent, but not my favourite. Overall I would definitely recommend an afternoon tea at Thierry, and perhaps will drop in to try their Quiche Lorraine and a glass of wine one day soon."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNLGgg-4alfqhz7RDRPxWnHPlBFeP6KalR8Aidh\u0026fid=0x0:0xd1f2de1256958934""],""When"":""2024-10-16""},{""Name"":""Sally Sant"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVCTy6BCeoOMzHLCaaDKS5rvGRQPOL8Olp377x0VT5SQQugVkuI=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It may be overpriced but I think it is worth the price for sure.

the coffee roasting for ages and finally started to come regular. Although the seating is hit and miss – sometimes, we had to go elsewhere because there were many patrons parked long term with their laptops – we always try this place first because all the staff make consistent espresso drinks with excellent micro-foam and the order takers are experienced and accurate. They have an amazing variety of sandwiches, and it was my intent to try one soon except I finally became a vegan and missed the boat because they don't have any vegan+gluten-free sandwich offerings. I used to love the carrot cake, and still do, it is not sweet and very addictive, but now that I cannot eat eggs, wheat and dairy, that's out as well. My partner continues to enjoy it though, no longer able to share it with me. Despite the fact that the space is rustic and the couches are too soft, we love that it is on the second floor and gives us a great view of Jonathan Rogers Park and Vancouver. In the winter, they don't have a canopy, so we cannot sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. I vote that they install a new rain-proof awning and replace the cold metal chairs outside!!!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOpiylYjM7Nu5oCXPl_phc57MNAYImze0DZLbM_\u0026fid=0x0:0xf390b967328c5001""],""When"":""2024-11-2""},{""Name"":""Julia Kuznetsova"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXEmartIB1DRbABoVaUe1Rfv6f-e8r57V_5Ft_eBmZX63ydyrY=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The place is nice, as you have different options for sitting - inside or outside.

I came by three times this week to test the consistency of their incredible mocha from the killer dark mocha, raspberry, and the hazelnut hedgehog mocha- it never disappoints. As a mocha fan, I can easily say this is one of the best in Vancouver.\n\nOn top of my discovery of the great mocha, I was tipped off by one of the baristas of an ideal match for it: the Hazelnut Dacquoise. It’s nutty, airy, slightly chewy, and delicately crispy—boy honestly it’s one of the best pastry and coffee pairing I’ve ever had. The topping has a delightful mix of chopped hazelnuts, and every bite brings a feeling of happiness and contentment. This slice is now on top of my list. Just the right size, making it guilt-free for health conscious people like me, plus it’s affordable.\n\nPart of me wanted to keep this as a secret—I don’t want them to run out of Dacquoise when I’m there! But why let this discovery stay a secret when others could feel the same joy? If I’m celebrating or just rewarding myself, this combo would now be one of my default options. I’ve tried other loaf cakes here, but nothing compares. I’m thrilled to have found this little comfort that keeps me coming back, and with such fantastic service and the relaxing view facing the Rogers Park setting the vibe, it’s become a true favourite spot."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipODYKNmalk26zw7Sesv7IrDRzHhn2pQVF0Q0SIF\u0026fid=0x0:0xf390b967328c5001""],""When"":""2024-11-15""},{""Name"":""Pearobearo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWJytlYP3krNLbRwHHThbPHsotJR7HIGvSdTdRI-mBoQ7I0EO4=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The first time I was here the killer mocha kept me dreaming about this place.\n\nThe second visit was not as magical but it was still a really good mocha (not as fragrant).

They brought out the cutest tea pots and cups for their hot chocolate, which made the experience extra special and memorable for the little ones.\n\nThe coffee was good, though not exceptional—I’d give it a solid 4 stars.

It’s not a bad thing, but I personally enjoy spaces where art and ambiance elevate the experience. For these reasons, I’m deducting one star for atmosphere and one for the lack of variety.\n\nThat said, I’ll definitely return for their coffee—it’s perfect for grab-and-go moments and consistently high-quality!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPkzeH0fGtdoZF5B9E4Q84tNawA_JpdnTW7vrtg\u0026fid=0x0:0x1384332e17fc16d1""],""When"":""2024-11-18""},{""Name"":""Elisa Kazan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUfnXq79FXK6SM_3Qr0x9E7eqGAf2iM5e785pouauMfz2nICrvAIg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Cute coffee shop on Broadway!

The baguette is somehow not the ordinary version of French baguette, it feels a bit thinner on the shell,  more like crispy rice paper.   The meat smells very good,  the amount of meat was decent as well.\n\nWe asked the cashier to cut in half for us.  End up he brought it out to us in the basket.

But I’m sure others would still find it enjoyable without my suggestions. The drinks we ordered had good flavour, but I would recommend getting half sweet next time since I found the regular “mango passionfruit drink” to be a tad too sweet for me.\n\nService - staff were super friendly and showed a high level of excitement when greeting customers as they walked in through the door.\n\nCleanliness - it’s a new location so the space is very clean. It has a decent amount of seating for those who want a place to hangout or maybe even work/study\n\nOverall if you are in the area and like Banh Mi it’s worth a try.

It’s rare to find a restaurant or café with such high standards, and I’m so grateful to have discovered this gem after hours of research (for ube 😂) during our trip to Vancouver! As an ube fanatic, this place was absolutely perfect. Here’s the breakdown:\n1.\tWaffle: Perfectly crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, with distinct ube flavors throughout. Highly recommend pairing with ube ice cream—but don’t place it directly on top to preserve the waffle’s crispness.\n2.\tChicken: Golden-brown and perfectly crispy with the right temperature and thickness. Slightly salty for me, but sparkling water balanced it out beautifully.\n3.\tSalad: The dressing was too heavy for my mild palate, so I’d separate it next time.\n4.\tFries: A few at the top had the ideal crispness and temperature. Slightly salty for my taste, but overall not bad. (Note: I’m not a big fan of steak fries, so take this with a grain of salt—pun intended!)\n5.\tUbe Latte: Stunning presentation, but tasted more like milk to me. I added no sugar, so that could be why. It paired perfectly with the waffle and ice cream, though, as I found the ice cream slightly sweet for my liking.\n6.\tUbe Bun: Loved the cream filling!

There are many other shaved ice shops in the lower mainland where the price and quality are more in keeping with reality and where the amount of fresh fruit topping is a lot more than the few paper thin slices that you get at Passion 8.

The noodles were incredibly delicious and authentically Chinese, with just the right amount of spice to elevate the dish without overwhelming it. The flavors were spot-on, and the beef was tender and perfectly seasoned. I enjoyed it so much that I finished the entire bowl and found myself still craving more.\n\nWhile I’ve loved most of the dishes I’ve tried here, the spicy beef noodle has definitely taken the top spot on my list.

Individual employees are doing their best to do their job well, but I feel like there’s an overall structure that falls short of them performing well. Here are some examples.\n\n- when you place an order through the kiosk, your hot food and drink items will be completed but any pastries you ordered are totally forgotten about. It seems like it’s unclear who is responsible for packing these items or there isn’t an efficient notification system for these items.\n- likewise, I’ve placed an order at the counter during busy periods when the cashier is most focused on helping everyone in the line; they don’t stop to get me my pastries and I’m left waiting with my hot items and drinks trying to flag a busy staff member to ask after my missing items.\n- they appear to be chronically understaffed — I have rarely seen more than 4 staff members working at a time no matter how busy it is and that just isn’t enough people for how busy this location is. During busy periods all of the staff seem stressed and I’ve seen inaccuracies in my own orders and in other patrons as a result. I’ve routinely come into the store and seen only 1 member working during the afternoon or evening — maybe they have a coworker on break or doing cleaning/baking in the back, but that is not adequate coverage.\n- this location also seems to routinely run out of necessary supplies: more than once I’ve been turned away because they’ve run out of cups— how does that happen?\n- low staffing all means not enough attention is given to maintaining the dining room, bathrooms, or display cases — this is a highly trafficked location and it is always messy and chaotic on the floor\n\nThese kinds of routine, chronic problems aren’t the fault of any one staff member nor are they a product of poor work ethic on the part of customer facing staff — there is a leadership problem that needs to be resolved internally so that all staff can do their job well. I hope the staff at this location get the managerial support they deserve — they are staffed almost exclusively with young recent immigrants to Canada and I wish each of them high wages and patient customers 💛"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Outdoors \u0026 Overdrive"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJzQhqU1s2qQJ6jKpkKL8D8Cwnr__t-kEzE-hdVKhsV4XNPqA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Probably one of the better locations, service is good, restaurant is very clean.

Let me start with saying the employee/owner/server lady was lovely. Unfortunately her personality didnt make the food or coffees, as it was all downhill from there. The Grilled cheese was a very basic, barely toasted Wonder Bread style sandwich. Accompanying tomato soup was barely lukewarm, but at least somewhat homemade taste. The croissant breakfast sandwich consisted of black charcoal on one side, completely squished down to about 1 1/2\"" tall, with rubbery, formed eggs in the center. The mocha tasted like it had been blended up with a powdered mix, and the Americano undrinkable: we wouldve been happier with a tin of Nabob at home! Dumped it out and there were grounds in the bottom, not sure how that even happens. Only good part about our visit is we decided to park in the 'permit only' parking without one, and we didnt get a ticket."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

This is the first cafe in the area I’ve seen with coffee on tap which was really cool.\n\nI love that it’s on the way to UBC and PSA they’re opening a NEW location on macdonald st in the fall!\n\n🌟tip: students get 10% off drinks\n\n🍂they always come out with fun seasonal drinks so make sure to stay tuned for their fall sips in September!\n\nThere’s is also a loyalty account and an app to order online."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOXkbP4LToH6XPlhBVefLsVMPRkOEpF_MkZ2_kf\u0026fid=0x0:0x9cc861b337d4f6be""],""When"":""2024-8-29""},{""Name"":""Stephanie De Leon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUPtSGjsqOZ_EhbXhnwXOaGVL6b_NNivonu1chio9B4-8j5GbnL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great coffee!!

The almond croissant was very, very hefty with generous almond filling. It was very sweet but still enjoyable for me (I have a very strong sweet tooth though). The second time I went there, I got the pithivier and another almond croissant. Both pastries were super dry (even a little bit stale) and the paste was very bland.

You can ask for free ice water at the counter when ordering. We managed to get a table around 11:30 for lunch, but it was filling up quickly. They have a mixture of single seats (counter) and tables inside and outside. The pocket was $6.75 and grilled/warmed nicely, just as cheesy as we'd hoped! The sandwich was filling for $9.25, and was on a rosemary \u0026 cheddar sourdough.

The iced Ube haze latte was amazingly full of ube flavor with the perfect amount of Vietnamese coffee ☕ and best of all it was safe for a dairy sensitive person 👌🏽 The staff gave thoughtful suggestions like to try the coffee jelly dalgona drink too so would definitely try that next time.

lunch here! I got the caponata panini, a brownie gelato sandwich, and a cup of rooibos tea. The sandwiches are premade and sit in a case until they’re grilled, but nonetheless the focaccia was fresh and the filling of roasted veggies and cheese was great. The gelato sandwich was good - raspberry gelato between two slices of brownie. Hard to make a judgment about the quality of the gelato itself based on the brick of it in the sandwich, but it totally did the job for a sandwich and the raspberry flavour seemed natural, not overly sweet, and the brownie was nice and moist. Decent tea, nothing out of the ordinary there. My total was about $25, about average value for downtown.\nThe place is located under a hotel and it doesn’t have a lot of character, but it’s spacious and quiet, and the counter chairs were super comfortable, so for my taste it’s a nice relaxing spot even if it is generic. The staff were all polite."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNS2XTd5vypQ_iZM5D35TySNG-fuLcysn2a92ap\u0026fid=0x0:0xb0a94f91a8c9aa1a""],""When"":""2023-10-11""},{""Name"":""Gurv"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXhwceJhFcjYo11eH0UjktVpbt4vgW7SS5aHechrSipNjogSGM7=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""I have stopped by at Beyond Coffee a few times, and have always observed that it’s a pretty quiet spot.
