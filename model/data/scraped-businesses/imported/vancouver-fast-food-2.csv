I've been waiting for almost five months since I first saw their signs, and it officially opened about a week ago. It's located inside the Lelem Village, which is great because there's a nice outdoor space where you can sit and enjoy the summer. There are also outdoor games available there.\n\nThe staff are nice and kind—I asked for additional sauce, and they happily gave it to me, so I'm giving them a 10/10 😛. The quality of the food is the same as at all other Popeyes locations: it's nice and tasty, perfect if you enjoy fast food. Everything is orderly and clean, and you can order ahead using the app and pick it up when you get there.\n\nI definitely recommend their hot wings and butterfly shrimp; both were really nice and tasty. Try all the different sauces—personally, I prefer the buttermilk ranch, but I also like the Cajun cocktail sauce, which is pretty unique to me.\n\nI'll definitely try more and update my review if anything changes. 🍤 🍗 🍟\n\n[Update, 2024, September]\nIt's been a while since I posted another review, but everything is still just as good. They’re now available on their website, and you can order ahead. The rewards in the app could be improved—they don’t quite match up to others, but still better than nothing. This time, I ordered the classic chicken burger along with fried onions and mashed potatoes. The onions are on another level—I really love them. The mashed potatoes are a bit spicy but still tasty. As for the burger, I personally prefer it with a bit of ranch, but honestly, with or without, it's still delicious.

The Kitsilano location's ambiance added to the overall experience, with its cozy and inviting vibe.\n\nThe menu offered a tantalizing array of treats, making it hard to decide what to indulge in. After much deliberation, I settled on a classic DQ Blizzard, and let me tell you, it was pure bliss in a cup! The ice cream was perfectly creamy, with just the right amount of sweetness. The mix-ins were generous and evenly distributed, providing bursts of flavor with every spoonful.\n\nI opted for the Oreo Blizzard, and the chunks of cookie blended seamlessly with the velvety ice cream, creating a symphony of taste and texture that left me craving more. Not only was the dessert impeccable, but the service was also exceptional. The staff at the Kitsilano location went above and beyond to ensure that my visit was nothing short of fantastic. They were attentive, courteous, and genuinely passionate about delivering a top-notch experience to every customer.\n\nThe ambiance of the Kitsilano store was inviting, with clean and cozy seating areas perfect for enjoying my treat. Whether you're stopping by for a quick bite or settling in for a leisurely indulgence, Dairy Queen in Kitsilano provides the ideal setting for a delightful dining experience.\n\nOverall, my visit to Dairy Queen in Kitsilano was an absolute delight, and I cannot wait to return for another dose of deliciousness. If you're craving delectable treats served with a side of warm hospitality, look no further than Dairy Queen in Kitsilano.

I responded to him, letting him know that I heard him and that it won’t take 30 minutes to eat.  He then whined, saying “I already cleaned that table, now I have to clean it again”, while giving me another crappy look.  Um, excuse me?  This is a small location with 6 tables.  Whining and attempting to guilt-trip an unsuspecting customer who has every right to sit and eat while the business is open - well before closing time - is unprofessional and rude.  It’s even more ridiculous that this was the manager.  I brought up the issue with him about how he reacted on my way out and I got a solid 5 minutes worth of excuses and barely an apology.  All the effort he put into defending his actions was a lot more than it would have taken to simply give the table a last quick spritz and a wipe.  I was out of there 15 minutes before closing.

The Deluxe pizza was decent: crust was crispy, toppings filled the pizza, beautifully melted/charred in their XLT speed oven. And around the outer edge of the pizza is a heavy sprinkling of sesame seeds, which lends a texture like crunchy pizza dough. Kind of nice.\n\nThe online ordering platform tells you the order will take minimum 20 minutes, which was spot-on for my order. They also sell pizza by the slice for $2.38+tax in-store.\n\nBest thing: they give you your takeout pizza in a cardboard box, so there’s no $0.25 bag fee!\n\nThe restaurant itself has probably 10 small tables—some inside, some outside—for eating there."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNDOuHiDIZTmdoXWax2rwLSqlNZvYhweoWLQ0nu\u0026fid=0x0:0x860b3a2c6558c7be""],""When"":""2024-8-2""},{""Name"":""Iman Sh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWY_It5dFbhJ3ahD3y8wnnvsyYECBdVwU0ipYiueTLf-0IgvGbE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Uncle Fatih's Pizza is one of the best pizza experiences I've had in Vancouver. When comparing price and taste, it's honestly way better than other chain pizza places. We ordered a medium Meat Lovers and a medium Eggplant Artichoke, and enjoyed both of them. The chipotle dip was a nice addition, though it's not very spicy. The pizza itself is juicy and full of flavors.\n\nIf you were to compare it to an authentic Italian restaurant in Downtown, I can't say for sure how it would hold up—I haven't tried that yet. But this place serves great pizzas with good quality. As long as the quality stays consistent, it will always be one of my favorite pizza places.\n\n[Update, July 1, 2024]\nWe ordered an extra-large half-and-half pizza. One half was Sweet \u0026 Spicy Lovers, and the other was Eggplant Artichoke. We enjoyed both. The Sweet \u0026 Spicy Lovers pizza has pineapple slices, so if you enjoy the sweetness of pineapple on your pizza, it could be really nice. The spiciness comes from banana peppers, which are quite intense—I’d rate the spicy level 9/10 and usually avoid the banana peppers with the last pieces. The meat on the pizza was very nice, though."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP3LNwcz4Mhb2_rAOeKq6HQ2yu9c_abTPsvF_gY\u0026fid=0x0:0x860b3a2c6558c7be""],""When"":""2024-6-27""},{""Name"":""Bruno Rodrigues"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXhILuyIb0LIP6MudwbcSE2BAlE-f9U9SKRT2p9lsRwJ4hM0FgDLg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Awesome bang for the buck – 20th anniversary deal was any slice for $2.38 plus taxes.

However they did their best to give us a deal anyways, so we left a tip as much as we could.\n\nThe pizza was tasty, I would personally recommend the ham and pineapple! The others were great too but not as traditional in taste as they were a little more complicated in ingredients. Not a bad thing, I just like my pizza simple 🥰\n\nOtherwise felt the food was very tasty and would return if they had better prices, maybe some Italian style/thinner/cheaper made slices could help things as a recommendation?

The burger i had was one of the gluten free options and i did find it quite dry. That could be from just the bun used or maybe it was the pulled patty, adding more sauce helped a lot. The large butter chick'n poutine was incredibly large, very generous.\n\nI would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area.I would love to return sometime to try more of their meals.

I then tried calling and spoke to someone who didn’t even try to rectify the problem.

hotspot for donair enthusiasts, and trust me, once you've had a taste, you'll never look at donairs the same way again.\n\nThe donairs are a work of art – think soft, pillowy pita bursting with the freshest, most flavorful meat that's been spinning on the rotisserie to savory perfection. Each bite is like a flavor explosion that'll have your taste buds doing a happy dance. And the platters, oh man, talk about a feast! They pile on all the good stuff – juicy meat, fresh veggies, and sauces that'll make your taste buds tingle with joy.\n\nBut what really sets this place apart is the freshness. I mean, we're talking about ingredients that are as fresh as can be. It's like they pluck the veggies straight from a garden and the meat is so tender, you'd think it was carved just for you.\n\nAnd the location? Right smack dab in the middle of downtown Granville. It's the heart of the city, and this donair joint is like a food oasis in the bustling urban jungle. The vibes are alive, the energy is electric, and the whole experience is just downright unforgettable.\n\nSo, if you're on the hunt for super-good donairs and platters that are as fresh and interesting as they come, you'll find your haven right downtown on Granville.

Instead of an initial apology, what we got was doubt until they realize that it was in fact a roach in the food. They offered to make another bowl but I instead requested a refund. Afterwards, I was offered another bowl to which I rejected and asked them to check their ingredients just to make sure. The server said it was probably from the lettuce and barely expressed an apology which was concerning. However, upon examining the photo we took, the roach looked cooked. We then assumed that the roach was fried in one of the display lights and then fell onto the guac. It was also noticeable that this branch was messy, unclean, and did not feel up to standard. This experience was overall upsetting as Chipotle as we usually have a good experience in either downtown or in the Metrotown branches.

My husband, inexplicably captivated by this corporate entity, exemplifies the modern consumer, drawn to the hollow allure of mass-produced mediocrity that ironically demands more from us while offering less.\n\nOver the course of these three weeks, I've observed a consistent reduction in portion sizes, a disturbing metaphor for how global capitalism strips away our substance, leaving us with less while expecting us to do more—even cleaning up after ourselves. The notion of value has become an illusion, where the consumer is shortchanged not just in what is served but in every aspect of the experience, including the expectation that we perform tasks once considered basic services.\n\nOn my first visit, I dismissed the lackluster service as a one-off, perhaps a day where the corporate machine had temporarily stalled. But by my second visit, it was clear this was not an anomaly; the staff, disoriented and seemingly purposeless, acted as if their only directive was to leave the customer to their own devices—to serve themselves, both in meal and in maintaining the cleanliness of the space. Their aimless behavior reflects a deeper societal malaise—one that alienates workers from their labor, reducing their roles to mechanical motions devoid of engagement, while simultaneously shifting the burden of service onto the customer.\n\nThe exorbitant price attached to this experience is a stark reminder of how the elites exploit the economy, charging more while delivering less, all under the guise of self-service. The filth that permeated the tables was a physical manifestation of this self-serve ideology—a sign that cleanliness, like the quality of the meal, has been outsourced back onto the consumer. It’s as though the basic expectation of a clean dining area has been abandoned, leaving us to manage it ourselves, further eroding any sense of collective responsibility or communal care.\n\nWhen I turned back to the cashier after struggling to find a clean table, she asked if I wanted a bag. I replied with a simple \""okay,\"" to which she retorted with a baffling, \""okay yes or okay no, what does that even mean?\"" This absurd exchange perfectly encapsulates how communication, like every other aspect of service, has been degraded in this commodified, self-serve environment. My straightforward request should have been clear, yet it became mired in confusion, a byproduct of an interaction stripped of genuine connection, where even the most basic tasks are passed back to the customer.\n\nDespite my growing discontent, I anticipate another visit, driven by my husband’s unrelenting craving for this overpriced, commodified gruel. This divergence in taste underscores a broader reality in modern relationships: the ongoing negotiation of disparate desires within the artificial confines of a society that insists on self-service in every sense—demanding that we not only tolerate poor service but also take on the responsibilities that were once theirs. In the end, this isn’t just about a disappointing meal—it’s a reflection of the broader struggle for authenticity, meaning, and even basic service, in a world increasingly dominated by forces that strip us of all three, leaving us to clean up the mess ourselves."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNHn2iDb_SNFlh1k9nIcSqlGKLgA7mPhFsGD4AB\u0026fid=0x0:0xf3432ba79c0904ac""],""When"":""2024-8-24""},{""Name"":""Jenine Walker"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJGrHsn8_KdzQGSzRRSYGrI0XfJWk03ad0jIBDV1PIF735Zpw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Got a burrito bowl and they barely added any protein.

Ingredients are fresh, and the closest thing I can find to Montreal style Pizza in Vancouver. Only giving it three stars because we usually order wings with our pizza and they always suck. They always show up with black stuff stuck all over them. Like the kind of stuff you find at the bottom of your barbeque when you scrape it after cooking. I called the restaurant to let them know, and the girl who answered said it’s because they roast them extra long. I happen to work in the food and beverage industry and that’s complete BS. I am also insulted that she thinks her customers are stupid enough to believe that. They need to change the tray in which they are baking their wings more often. Too many burnt bits from previous orders of wings. I would never let food leave my kitchen looking like these wings. I tried to clean off the black stuff with a Scott towel, but my son had black stuff all over his teeth from eating these wings."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNDStG0lhmWTsCfnDtV9uXSoR65ZEPdJfM1WACy\u0026fid=0x0:0x36093c14bf1cc313""],""When"":""2023-7-4""},{""Name"":""Erica"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIZBkN4BxKXFj3jq1FxJL-jojchc6LtKnZbzzms0L15OoGL7A=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""We used to order here often, but they’ve become stingy now.

My husband visited the restaurant for the first time with a friend and came home raving about the food. The next day, we came together and loved it.\n\nWe both ordered an Ultimate Burger \u0026 Dip. With each Ultimate Burger, you can add bacon or a sunny side egg. We both chose bacon. You're also served a large portion of fries and your choice of a dip. The dip is huge! Picture a Dixie cup full of may. We tried Jamaican Heat Mayo and Garlic Mayo. Jamaican Heat Mayo wasn't very flavourful, but Garlic Mayo was delicious.\n\nWe also ordered the Deep Fried Pickles and dip. For this dip, we tried Scallion Green Mayo. This was our favorite dip.

It seems like every 6 months to 10 months prices are hiked. I question how other fast food corps can have better value and better prices than McCorp.\n\nMy family and huge extended families come to McDonald’s because of the memories we’ve had. When our mom use to pick us up after school in the elementary years everyday and there was a McDonald’s across the street. When our grandma had some money left over to take her all her grandchildren out for a mcd day. We would talk about anything and have big smiles on our faces. McDonald’s at that time was special and nostalgic. Over the years we’ve collected memorabilia like the bed sheets and shower curtains .Many more Memorabilia that I won’t even post online.\n\nI’m looking at the current generation of families that cannot have these new memories without questioning their spending because of the menu prices. Every family I see coming in are not buying combos and I see mothers feeding their kids first then eating their left overs when they had enough…these are not mchappy memories.\n\nI recently just got back from a trip from Washington state. It’s actually worse… even though they have the 1,2,3 dollar value items.\nLots of signs saying bathrooms are for customers only. Not one single person I saw ordered a full combo. Not as many smiles dining.\n\nThis is a message to the McDonald’s Corp.\nYes, you will still have customers. Some of the time who don’t have time, who are lazy, and who believe your French fries are the king. Yes you will still have customers who love your summertime dollar drinks and ice cream cones. Yes you will have people who are devoted to your brand all over the world…\nBut as all that is going on you missed out on what’s going on now. That these families who cannot afford or have value from your brand is now creating new happier memories and getting better value from other fast food chains. Memorable moments with their grandparents and loved ones. Tailgate meet ups at other fast food joint parking lots. More affordability which means it’s not a once a week or month occurrence.\n\nThis is just my opinion and from what I’ve seen. I am the few that luckily can afford this brand. During lockdown I am an essential worker working LONG hours everyday and I literally bought this brand everyday for 2 years non stop because I had no time to pack a second lunch or make a proper coffee. If you don’t believe me ask management all along marine drive to marine way market crossing. Along with this location on knight. This brand gave me comfort in the most uncertain times. I and a few other in the drive thru also paid for the person behind us just to make their day happier. We didn’t have to but we followed a movement that was on social media. It created a mchappy memory…\n\nNow my final question to the McDonald’s food corporation. Can you make better prices and value so that your customers who want to be like a second family would want to continue bringing generations to your brands consistently? Because they are making memories elsewhere. You haven’t been affordable nostalgia for a while in case you haven’t noticed.\n\nUpdate after 2 weeks of posting.\nEven your coupon booklet isn’t reasonable for families."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNGlYJXdQZqJ63KCRLrfAhJNvTNFMT3DwrJ-h2k\u0026fid=0x0:0x34c4cd0844c8b48c""],""When"":""2024-3-29""},{""Name"":""Jeanne M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLLOWBH8NGqqsl5I8s_Iw6M9jwENQkw814Drzz2sFzuQGsiaQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I’m confused by the poor reviews.

While the serving was large, the fish tasted like old, burnt, cooking oil. While some like crispy batter, this one was well beyond crispy. You had to battle through it with firm stabs of the provided wooden fork. If the word ‘fish’ had not been on the menu I would not have known what that white stuff inside the batter was. Zero taste. A bland, underwhelming taste of nothing. The fries were just passable, by which I mean only arguably edible.

Staff does not care about in person orders or wait times. One staff member was taking a single order from start to completion before taking another order to minimize the appearance of wait times. Once the order was complete they would take the next order.\n\nThis was during lunch, there were 14 people waiting to have their order taken or who chose to use Uber eats so they didn’t have to wait. Multiple people left because the wait was ridiculous.\n\nRather than have an appropriate staffing level for this busy lunchtime location, management chooses to have people walk out during busy periods, even sending staff on break DURING the rush.\n\nFood was cool, drinks (supposed to be served in frozen mugs) were warm and in warm mugs as the “glass freezer” was not working, and the condiment dispenser area was stocked with runny, old, or damp products. Ketchup was so sunny it sprayed out of the pump dispenser and over filled the paper cups they used so it was all over your hands, salt, pepper, and sugar packets were damp and clumpy so you could use them.\n\nThey should honestly open a ghost kitchen to fill online orders and corporate should come in and teach staff here what customer service is supposed to be.\n\nIt is obvious that these kids don’t care and neither  does location management.

The girl serving me not only entered the wrong order but also didn't seem to be paying attention and lacked any friendliness.\n\nEven after I corrected her, I still received the incorrect order, with no tomatoes or spicy sauce in the burger.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't have time to return my order and ask for it to be fixed since I was on my break and couldn't afford to wait. So, I just ate what I was given.

The burger had jalapeños and crunchy pickles inside, but somehow I was eating a burger with only chicken, lettuce, and chipotle mayo. I felt like it could use a bit more kick, like hot sauce, or freshness from tomato. I liked their brioche bun, though.\n\nIncluding a diet coke and tips, I paid $30, and I was pretty shocked by Vancouver's prices again.

Lemme tell ya, the prices weren’t like they use to be that’s for sure.\n\nIt was 2:30am in the morning and I had a hankering for ice cream. I didn’t know this location was open till 5am! So I went for a drive. I never tried the strawberry cheesecake blizzard before, ever. It’s definitely my new blizzard favourite now. Generous chunks of cheese cakes. Mixed with chunks of strawberries and syrup. Man… it really hit the spot. I’m usually a Oreo or chocolate guy but this one really impressed me. Thank you for the cool treat! I wish I took a better picture but it was so good I gobbled it up so quickly!\n\nAs for service I mean… what do you expect. It’s graveyard. There were 2 guys hustling away stocking and cleaning. One guy at the cashier had a negative tone taking my order. He probably had a check list of duties going on from his boss. Or perhaps he has another job or problems at home. Second guy made the blizzard. I was wondering while he was making it if he was going to hand it to me upside down, like I always did when I was a teen. To my surprise he did, and with a smile. 😀"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBtdboEf85sihGD4pcpfK7hrBW0pDJDiKfzNZg\u0026fid=0x0:0x2bed4d4499a86380""],""When"":""2024-4-6""},{""Name"":""Rodel Lavarias"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK33jQzZLhkCsZO5Bkc9Qn94KDbG2JocChILQYPHxqzjar-GA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""08/10 12:25noon, no customers dined and a grumpy and very unprofessional service crew.

Having worked for Teavana I know what they are trying to do. The paper cups cost more, but not as much as reputation or already dedicated customers. Overall I'd say this place should be turned into an express with a sign that clearly states no washroom.  For all the reasons above I give this location a 1.\n\n*Edit*\nLater went to see if the bathroom even had a sign for out of order.  It didn't so tried the door and it was hard to open, but managed to get inside and found there was no key.  Used the washroom and no leaking.  The employees are blatantly lying to their customers saying the key is lost or worse that the key is locked inside which by my photos proves to be a lie.

for years in the Vancouver and San Jose California area and thought I've had mostly good and a few great subs along the way. So, when I ordered Viet Sub's \""Special sub\"", I was pleasantly surprised that it actually tasted especial--because it was delicious!!! Id say it was one of, if not the best Viet sub I've had as far as I can remember in my 20+ years of Viet sub eating experience. The bread was perfectly warm and crusty without being too hard and dry. The fillings, especially the pork, tasted and looked fresh and juicy.  I think the pork and bread set it apart from the others. Just delicious. It's hard to fault it...maybe a little too small?\n\nWhen I'm in the area, whether or not I'm craving for that sub, I'll definitely want to return to have a taste of it again.\n\nThe place was just a little tight so it may be a bit hard to eat there during busy periods tho I've never really been there during a busy period.\n\nNice friendly service. No upselling, just straightforward.\n\nI rarely give 5 stars but based on my experience, I can't give Viet sub anything lower than a 4.5, so 5 stars it is."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPuMZqpd585GyVZdMBxatPPL9kW0bUQfxegRG4c\u0026fid=0x0:0x7841c3ab476168bc""],""When"":""2024-12-8""},{""Name"":""Deanna Wong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXAIMuiZXNoLL-0mgGkxcsbbha_YGCdK_P3PUPvdJtUCcYnOe99=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Already dug in before I took a photo 😂 I don’t usually do reviews but I really do love this place.

We ate inside the tables were gross, but once again McDonald's....what do you really expect here? Lots of parking as we came in late.

I waited and asked the manager or possibly supervisor, and got the same response. I had to wait in line again while my food was getting cold. I was disappointed that I had to pay for extra McChicken sauce. The approach could have been a lot better. For example, they could have said, \""Sorry sir, we charge for McChicken sauce at this location. In the future, please pay at the till, but here is your McChicken sauce for today. Sorry about that.\""\n\nOR POST AT THE TILL WE CHARGE FOR EXTRA CONDIMENTS??? CHEAP FRANCHISEE...\n\nWhen I tried to get a Coke, both Coke machines were broken.

The 𝒅𝒐𝒖𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒄𝒌𝒆𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒈𝒉 𝑩𝒖𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒓 was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and absolutely packed with flavour.

Something to note for next time!\n\nThe 𝑩𝒆𝒘𝒂𝒇𝒂 𝑩𝒖𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒓  (𝒅𝒐𝒖𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒑𝒂𝒕𝒕𝒚) was saucy and delicious but definitely a bit messy— perfect for big flavour lovers!

They somehow got the spice to even penetrate the meat! Even without the skin, the chicken was so flavourful. Very juicy and cooked on the spot after ordering. It's so fresh. The spicy chicken was a little too spicy for me -- I wouldn't get it again because my tolerance is low. Perfect for the spice lovers though!\n\nThere's not a lot of space to eat in, but there are a few tables if you choose to do so.

They are expanding in a market that includes many styles (Japanese, Korean, etc.) and, therefore, flavours. But the demand for fried chicken is obviously there, so they will probably do well in this city. This location, in particular, is right on the entertainment strip on Granville St. and this guarantees foot traffic. This time, I tried their Blackened Chicken Sandwich and Cajun Fries combo. It's not cheap at $14, but there's nothing cheap these days. Overall, it was a decent meal. The chicken is flavourful, not overly greasy. The fries are crisp and very tasty. For drinks, they are limited. Only your typical 5-6 soda flavours in the machine. The service was friendly.

My friend had placed an order, and it seemed like she needed some help, possibly from the manager who was busy making burgers. It was unclear whether she asked for assistance and got denied, but she was clearly left to handle the front alone.\nAfter a while, a Sardar gentleman stepped in to help her, and honestly, he did an excellent job. Both of them managed the increasing crowd with impressive patience and efficiency. I could see how stressed she was, and she even apologized for the wait times, but really, it wasn’t her fault. The poor girl was doing everything she could, and I commend her for staying calm under pressure.\nMore power to both of them for managing the rush so well despite the lack of support from the management. It's a shame that the manager wasn’t stepping up to help, but at least those two crew members made the experience much better than it could have been. I’m giving 3 stars, and it's really more for those two staff members—thank you for your hard work and dedication.

Are you collecting points with the app? NO. How many ketchups do you want? NONE. How many napkins? TWO. I don't blame the cashiers, I don't think they have a choice, but now, asking me what type of pop I am going to get? What difference does it make? You are handing me an empty cup, you can press whatever button you want, it doesn't matter. Unless you are going to come around and fill it up for me, you don't need to know. I might take one shot of each of the pops, I might eat the cup, who knows!\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back for me was tonight though. I have had too many warm cokes because they can't keep the ice machine running. I'm standing there, like an idiot, pressing my cup against the handle waiting for ice and nothing. I asked the supervisor if they have anything back there, ice in a jug, crushed ice, anything that would save me from a warm drink. NOPE, apparently they have to truck the ice in from across the food court somewhere and she needs to find someone to go get it.\n\nWhat a mess.

The Philly Cheese Chicken Steak, in particular, deserves praise. It's a well-constructed dish featuring tender chicken, a spicy sauce that adds just the right kick without overpowering, and cheese that brings a creamy balance to the mix. All these elements are tucked into a bun that's soft yet resilient enough to hold everything together until the last bite. Additionally, their halal-friendly menu is a significant plus, catering to a broader audience and ensuring that more people can enjoy their offerings.\n\nThe service at Raoul Burger Shack adds to the overall positive experience. Suhail and Awais were the staff members who attended to me during my visit. Their approach to customer service was practical and focused on efficiency, ensuring that my meal was enjoyable without any unnecessary fuss. They were attentive and helpful, demonstrating a clear understanding of the menu and the ability to make recommendations tailored to customer preferences.\n\nThe ambiance of Raoul Burger Shack is another point worth noting. It's clean, with a straightforward layout that prioritizes comfort and convenience. Focus remains on the food and the service, aligning with what one would expect from a pragmatic and efficiently run shop.\n\nIn essence, Raoul Burger Shack delivers where it matters: high-quality, delicious food, efficient and friendly service, and a welcoming atmosphere for dining. Their Philly Cheese Chicken Steak is a standout option that I highly recommend to anyone visiting or living in Vancouver. It's a clear indication of the care and attention to detail that goes into their food preparation.\n\nRao Burger Shack is worth the visit for those looking for a reliable, halal-friendly burger spot in downtown Vancouver. Suhail and Awais's dedication to customer satisfaction further enhances the dining experience, making it evident that this establishment values quality and service equally.

We don’t want to go back again. There are many flies flying everywhere, the washrooms for both men and women are disgusting, and the dirty dishes just placed on the washroom hallway with lots of flies. We can no longer accept this level of hygiene. Not recommend.\n\nUpdate on Sept 3, 2023 - it’s with huge disappointment to share that the quality of food is dramatically different from our last few experiences. We ordered the same lobster set and dishes and all of them were over cooked tonight. I’ve heard from others saying their food quality has declined however I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and experienced myself. And the rumors are real. Despite their denial, I feel the dishes tonight were cooked by a new chef. Need to find another restaurant as likely not going visit again.\n\nFirst few visits - The noodle stir fry is excellent - full of “wok air” 😅. The crab prawn ball is crispy and tasty. There are so many items we want to try and plan to visit regularly.\n4th visit - We went again and ordered the lobster with three other dishes - they all tasted excellent except they are very salty. I asked for low sodium at the time of order however they are saltier tonight than other visits.\n5th visit in July 2023 - reminded the server for low sodium given our last experience. They made it right this time. Glad that they listened."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOp4cuAxiZ34pNp_Q0MDfsac6gKNul33oY-tC3u\u0026fid=0x0:0x65925ec6c07f412c""],""When"":""2023-2-21""},{""Name"":""Kalvin"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXYzAZd-0_JeniSNljNxgImCwzlXWbe6PzaDeAXT6_nhg5vP5E=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Amazing service, lots of variety of food to choose from and reasonable price.

We picked this place on a whim after looking around online and seeing what was close.  It's a small family style restaurant and pretty busy (being Saturday night) but we luckily got a table right away.  The food portions are rather generous and very tasty.  We had enough to take back as left overs.  The next night we went out to another Cantonese restaurant and was pretty disappointed in both the service and food quality.  So the following night we decided to come back to James place and it once again held up.  Dishes tasted better than the Cantonese food in NYC for sure.\n\nWe showed up pretty late so after the other tables left, we were the only ones left and James, the owner, was rather personable chatting with us and gave us complimentary milk tea after my Uncle had mentioned he had been really looking for some good Hong Kong styled milk tea.  He took the time to even sit in with us and take a picture, joking that he'd put our picture on the wall. (The walls are covered with the dishes you can order as well as celebrities that have dined in the establishment over the years).\n\nOverall, it was a great restaurant that is really flexible with how you want your dishes prepared, like style, vegetables, type of noodle and mix and matching things not on the set menu for additional prices.  The lobster and crab over noodles was tasty, as well as their salt and pepper pork chops, Peking pork chop, and free range soy sauce chicken.\n\nI definitely would definitely recommend this place for Cantonese food if you're nearby in the Vancouver area."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNSmOAcONhdOyYuPmmb0mDiLBCZmbJiRxMRM0in\u0026fid=0x0:0x65925ec6c07f412c""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""Ada"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK_tT85lO7aZKFfq17wWpo8ldgI_n0GJFJfBhG1nWiEa2zXCQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Generous portions of food.

While I was offended by their service, their food was good enough that it almost compensated their horrible service. Almost. So it wasn't enough. Therefore I wouldn't recommend this place or be coming back.\n\nWe made reservations a week ago for 8 people at a specific time with specific dishes. Due to their popularity, we felt like reserving a king crab and a Peking duck is necessary. And a phone call was placed a day before to confirm all the details. However, when we arrived just 3 min before reservation time, they told us no table but almost almost. We understand that for busy Asian restaurants, sometimes it's hard to provide a table right on time. We told the waitress that we'll wait outside instead of having 8 people crowding their front door. She agreed and said almost almost, and I'll come get you.\n\n60mintues later, we're still in the cold waiting outside. I'm unsure how and why this happened, with advanced noticed and confirmation. Either way, we were cold and hungry. During that last 30min of waiting, we repeatedly head inside at 10min interval to remind the waitress that were still waiting outside, in the cold.\n\nEventually we were seated in a very crowded space. That means whenever one of us needed to stand up, we would have to ask the table behind us to provide some space. If you have clusterphobia, avoid this place. The waitress informed us that because we were kept waiting outside, the drinks are on them today. How nice, but a drink doesn't justify an hour of wait with reservation. Still, I appreciate the mild gesture. Then the owner came to show us, a group of 8, the king crab he saved for us, oh let me correct that, the sad king crab that is left. It was small, missing a leg, and not looking very fresh. Usually restaurants like these will let you choose another crab if you don't like it. But the owner said this is the last one.\n\nWhat happened to reserving a good king crab? With a week advanced notice....? Didn't we call twice to confirm?\n\nI am fairly upset by this point. You can only be so careless, especially in the service industry. The one thing that brought this restaurant to a 2 star is their food. Their sauce is not overpowering yet flavourful. This compliments the main ingredients nicely, whether it was beef or shrimp. Peking Duck was a bit dry, lack flavor. King crab was steamed with light seasoning. While it was hilariously tiny, the taste was good.\n\nConclusion: I couldn't recommend this place for their lack of care and sincerity but if you don't mind waiting 1 hour or more to have good food in a very cramped space, this might be the place for you. Come here for regular dishes, not king crab. For a $100 meal/per person, I suppose I expected more."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNdudg7ZTDWtug2knb2wTOy1AtCcV9_YDErKtc\u0026fid=0x0:0x65925ec6c07f412c""],""When"":""2024-4-1""}]",

The vegetables in the donair are fresh and crunchy. Soo delicious! The people are very friendly and courteous. I just feel really comfortable here.

The food is amazing, authentic, and delicious; prepared in an immaculate kitchen with traditional ingredients but with the modern ingenuity that you can only find in Mexico City or Guadalajara. Simply the best Mexican food in the lower mainland.\n\nThe atmosphere is modern but welcoming and comfortable; our server Eileen made us feel at home and made great recommendations for our first time. We're planning to become regulars because this is one of those places that you can eat exceedingly well without ever feeling uncomfortable; ingredients are fresh, top-quality, and dishes are healthy but oh so satisfying.\n\nFor instance, nowhere in BC will you ever find chayote (pear squash) salad, aguachile (like a ceviche), or tortas ahogadas (typical subs from Guadalajara with Livia bread) because this kitchen is miles ahead of the cookie-cutter Mexican food that we're used to here, offering us vegetarians and meat eaters sophistication and deliciousness at great prices.\n\nThe drinks are another refreshing (lit) feature: cocktails prepared with care in vintage glasses or wonderful brews, and a fun zero-proof selection like Jamaica (sorel).\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, they have a great playlist that had us grooving and vibing for the whole time! I can't wait to try the whole menu because every dish and drink our party order was scrumptious, satisfying, and prepared with care.

We were meeting old tenants of ours we keep in touch with and we had a long chat, we were never disturbed or rushed to vacate the table. I like the inside even though is a small place.\nThe not so good: Don't come here very hungry because the servings are on the small side, however I see that everywhere we go this days, Restaurant owners reducing the size of servings to compensate the high cost of ingredients, labour, rent, etc. So I get that part and I don't fault or give a bad review because of that. At the time to pay the bill, the machine handed to you comes with the tip screen and the lowest is 18%, I mean you can customize it, but I think everyone is doing that.

I have a couple of photos attached. These photos are showing expectation and reality. See if you can spot the difference. I purchased two Baconator Burger meals that came with fries and drinks. Unfortunately, we looked at the pictures that were displayed, and we both wanted baconators, and when we got them, we said that they can't be the same thing. You be the judge.\nAfter mentioning it to a basic manager, I asked her to bring me the store manager and she said she would and she never did. Upon leaving the store I managed to speak with the store manager or so she said add her comment was these are the old pictures. I said well this is what we saw and what we were expecting and certainly not what we got. For this kind of money I would have rather gone to A\u0026W and or Burger King and for a few dollars more I could go to White Spot and get a much better product with the ambiance.

Brad and team are serving up an amazing rotation of seasonal comfort food that will knock your socks off — skip the brunch lineup and walk right into this spot for dinner most nights of the week!\n\nLast night we had an **amazing** in house made French-style pate/terrine, following by a Caesar salad (complete with house smoked lardon), then we shared the steak frites with brined peppercorn + the pork cheek bourguignon — the pork cheek, just added to the menu, quickly became the STAR dish to fight over when sharing.\n\nPrior to this visit I had the smash burger and the bistro (wet) burger and both were fantastic. I will put red wagon’s burgers up against any Vancouver burger establishment (I’ve tried them all) for the WIN. My take is that they aren’t trying to copy other’s burgers styles and are just having fun bring you what they like so you can join them in burgerville.\n\nAlso a wicked cocktail and beer selection, and I haven’t even mentioned the dessert. Butterscotch custard is one of my favs but the creative assortment of milkshakes will always set you straight too.\n\nSo… go support a real local business, put your money in a real neighborhood and real local team, and be happy eating awesome food made from scratch that leaves you feeling fully satisfied and is still worth the $$ value!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM60BgUDdb6bpFd-96TeEqtBrbunM0r5CVEihsH\u0026fid=0x0:0x6075da54d0f16636""],""When"":""2024-10-19""},{""Name"":""Alex Y."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKw6vbDp2wwnwGTgY3u4AHRVGKyyIunXuhDwQ_GXEbd3GqTyiat=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I finally got the chance to have breakfast here and it did not disappoint.

Shack - Commercial Street\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nMy son and I visited Downlow Chicken on Commercial Street, and it was an experience worth every bite. The atmosphere is casual and laid-back, perfect for a relaxed meal. We were greeted warmly by the staff, who were helpful in explaining the menu and helping us choose the best options for our preferences.\n\nWe both went for their signature fried chicken sandwiches, and they did not disappoint. The chicken was incredibly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with just the right amount of spice. The flavor packed a punch but wasn’t overwhelming, making it one of the best fried chicken experiences we’ve had. The house-made sauces added a nice kick to the sandwiches, complementing the bold flavors of the chicken.\n\nWe also tried a side of the fries, which were seasoned perfectly and served piping hot. The portions were generous, so we definitely left feeling satisfied. The vibe in the restaurant was energetic and fun, with a steady stream of people coming in for their fried chicken fix.\n\nDownlow Chicken really lives up to the hype, and we will definitely be back for more. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a sit-down meal, it’s a must-try for any fried chicken lover. Highly recommend!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM68B8XUqu13hFJ89993grC0BIeeLUyQmUefa-q\u0026fid=0x0:0x75969767dbca6887""],""When"":""2024-10-6""},{""Name"":""michellebrown4"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkEMyAsWWgzknYkLqMFS1yqiBkRorrtVjHSB73_uCTAPIwl3Rx=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Always fantastic chicken.

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n**The Good:**\nThe waffles were a standout for me! They had jalapeños baked into the batter, which added a unique kick to the flavor. It was such a creative twist that really elevated the dish. They also served the waffles with a seasoned butter that I absolutely loved—it had a savory, almost herby taste that complemented the spicy jalapeño waffles perfectly.\n\n**The Not-So-Good:**\nI ordered the fried chicken with the chili flavor for an additional charge, but unfortunately, it didn’t meet my expectations. I was hoping for a hot, spicy variant of fried chicken with a crispy exterior, but what I got was chicken coated in a thick tangy chili sauce. It made the crispy outer layer of the chicken soggy, which took away from the classic fried chicken experience. This might just be a personal preference, but it wasn’t what I was expecting.\n\n**The Atmosphere:**\nThe place is very small, with only two tables inside and a couple of metal benches outside. It’s more of a grab-and-go kind of spot than a sit-down restaurant. That said, the service was friendly and welcoming, which added to the overall experience.\n\nOverall, the waffles and butter alone are worth trying, especially for those who enjoy bold flavors. As for the chicken, I’d recommend sticking to the classic version if you’re a fan of crispy fried chicken. Despite some misses, the friendly service and creative touches make this a spot to consider, especially if you’re in the area."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNe5ZY4hwmQf_oikD85rPTql8i5glYE_syJS5yx\u0026fid=0x0:0x3acaa5552ce0fe50""],""When"":""2024-11-21""},{""Name"":""Michelle McLatchy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVFj-ARxSUyfWePV4Nuk15cm4O_3Q8U-RBQPIoKZE3tQUxFmzygKg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It's not cheap but very good.

This is takeaway-only as there's no place to sit, and there's a table for standers but the place is really too small to support anyone eating in.\n\nBecause the hotdog is covered with rice mochi, it doesn't feel very heavy or oily, even when deep-fried.\n\nI tried the half sausage, half cheese dog.\n\nI liked the mozzarella in it: The mozzarella comes out soft, stringy and melted, which goes well with the crunchy shell.  It's very comforting/feel-good to eat.\n\nThe beef hotdog inside isnt anything special, it doesnt taste like 100% meat, it's just kind of soft processed meat... But the outside of the dog makes up for it. So the meat is definitely not costco hotdog level, it is almost like luncheon meat texture, so that could bother some people. It wasn't meaty enough for me. (Probably a typical \""American sausage\"" texture in other korean/asian food places too when they incorporate foreign ingredients, like into hotplates and hotpots etc. Its supposed to be a bit light i guess?)\n\nNext time ill prob try something with the chicken in it to see what it tastes like too.\n\nExtra toppings come at a price, I think $1-2 extra.  But\nthere are many sauces and cheese/butter powders for free you can choose that they put on for you. I think i took some chipotle mayo and bbq and some of the powders.\n\nPopular place for young people as it's also hard to find any takeout food under $10 that actually tastes good. If you are very hungry, you might need two dogs that would make it about $15 pre-tax."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPqu3F3gthiT_HezhQmGV4arsYPLukOq1ldEbSe\u0026fid=0x0:0x718bbd575e412752""],""When"":""2024-6-21""},{""Name"":""Phoebe Yoon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIBobFZYdkUy0kQUzZxOyqZ7NGAyh6Lk-gQMCkP71H6TcT_C47A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The food is delicious and definitely an affordable snack or meal.

I ended up throwing my meal in the garbage, which is something I almost never do.\n\nWhile I give Fatburger an A+ for creativity, the taste did not appeal to me."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPMHVPMy0JZaEftZWA9nuc9fUO_uCU3z2ZI7YGO\u0026fid=0x0:0xf83e51d6d5d63268""],""When"":""2023-5-31""},{""Name"":""Chris F"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV5iETqIQBeQI1auEFM0Tc1cLHlBlPg-u_xQZRZgDTvUjh6noO8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Love love love.

They were overly fried and very hard and just soaked everything in oil. The first batch we had was very hard and stale (?) and were not fluffy inside. The worker remade these for us and they looked slightly better but were still very tough and oily. I should've stuck to McDonalds across from them. Oh well, lesson learned.

I mostly do the build-your-own salad bowls, where you can combine a variety of interesting \""salads\"" with a base and optional protein of your choosing. The chili-lime tofu, my go-to, is grilled fresh and juicy with a tangy marinade. I find these bowls very filling, but the price adds up quickly as you add more salad scoops, so I find it best to be conservative with my estimate of how much I think I need to eat.\nBesides the salad bowls, they have some hot entrees. I tried the Moroccan chickpea hot bowl and the tomato soup and both were a little bland, which was especially disappointing for something labelled \""Moroccan\"". I would go back and try some different entrees to see if anything else is better, but I would say the salads are likely the best choice here.\nThey have a very limited selection of \""healthy\"" baked goods too. I really liked the chocolate pistachio cookie. As you would expect, it's significantly less sweet and has a slightly drier texture than a regular cookie, but if you like that kind of \""better for you\"" treat, it's good. Very cocoa-forward.\nI've had good experiences with the service. The staff is friendly enough and usually pretty fast.

Second, the Hummus, honestly idk what was that served with the food, It was alright but it wasn’t a hummus (see the orange solid thing in my pictures), I guess I’m a bit harsh because I was expecting an authentic experience.\nI would recommend other places if you’re looking for a freshly cut, authentic middle eastern food."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOKCm6TgrOju8wpR78fl18yglVlk72X6TtSY2da\u0026fid=0x0:0xd47f23ff5989cc7e""],""When"":""2021-2-26""},{""Name"":""Richard Hu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUCB56XCzqLXPTj0T4EOd8tvwIFn4GWTIrLiWLv_XQ1gQilVZqz=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Had to try this place just to compare all the other donair shops I’ve had around downtown.\n\nOverall I would come back only when they have specials / deals on throughout the week.\n\nFood is ok - fresh vegetables but chicken \u0026 pita bread was a little dry.

come all the way from Surrey just for their food!

They are usually set up near a place with places to sit such as Robson or Granville station which is very convenient as it is takeout only (obviously, it is a food truck, in case you didn’t know). The only downside to this is that there is very limited parking for those who are driving there, but thats nothing new in Vancouver.\n\nI only wish that they served soft drinks but maybe it’s better for my health that they don’t😂.

The onion rings were unseasoned and also cold. Moreover, they took a long time for my order to prepare. As, i asked for the jalapeño cheese onto my hash-brown, there was not any cheese and i paid for it. Also the cashier, she went back take fries by herself not even washing her hands.\nAfter ordering we asked one girl the cashier that the table is not clean and asked her to clean that , she only replied me okay. Nobody came there to clean it. Although, the floor looks so unhygienic. I asked again to clean it, one of the girl from back she came and cleaned it up and left the table wet. Moreover, My order was eat-in but she handed my order in bag with no napkins in it. I said my order is eat-in, she replied so rudely we don't have trays. It was my worst experience ever.

The last few visits have been disappointing. The staff have been unfriendly and the quality has gone down.

For instance on my last visit I asked for extra pickles and onions, but could barely tell. There were only 2 slices of tomato on my entire foot long sub and barely any meat. The subs were poorly wrapped and the takeout bag had mayo smeared on the front. It makes me apprehensive to come back to this location. I hope this isn’t due to the new management.\n\nI had a fantastic experience at this Subway. The service was friendly and quick.

Ie. Touching a door handle between meats and veggie sections, and not changing their gloves. If a customer has to ask you to change your gloves,  you are not paying enough attention.\nTheres also items getting mixed in the cambros, ie. Onions in the lettuce. Im allergic to onions, so this is a cross contamination risk. The staff need to be mindful of this and carefully pick ingredients out so the arent dropping all over the place. I noticed this issue in multiple cambros of ingredients\n\nFood:\nI dont know if its a lack of training, but theres a few issues ive noticed from my visits\n- Not assembling the sandwich correctly in terms of how they place meats, cheeses, and veggies. This causes the sub to be messy and difficult to eat.\n- Pressing the items down, if a sub is assembled correctly there should be no need to press down on the ingredients in order to close it.\n- bread not proofed long enough causing at least a 2inch different in size of the sandwich. This not only makes it smaller than what im paying for, but makes it difficult to put the ingredients on and messy to eat because the bread cant fit the whole order.\n- putting weird amounts of vegetables??? Idk if the process has changed since i worked there, but there used to be a minimum amount and specific way to assemble all the ingredients, both for the look and for the ease of eating it. Ofc you can always ask for extra, but there was a specific number to put on to begin with... but this location just kind of throws stuff on. You'll ask for pickles and get 3 on a footlong? The minimum was 8 when i worked there.\n\nThe food tastes the same, its subway. But theres issues with procedure, bread size,  and correct portions, and i think they need to be retrained.

First of all, their digital menu clearly stated that customers get free pickles and drinks with a full order, but they said that was no longer the case because many customers didn’t want pickles or drinks, so it was an additional cost.\n\nThen, after ordering my son asked to use a washroom (and they allow up to 10 patrons to sit in and dine, which we did) but they claimed to have no washroom and directed us to the Tim Hortons a few minutes up the street. I’m no lawyer, but I feel like this goes against provincial laws / Vancouver bylaws for dining establishments.\n\nOnto the food. We got a full order ($25) of half soy garlic and half cheese powder chicken to go along with shake-shake fries ($3.50). The food is nowhere near healthy, but it is delicious. The chicken is juicy and the fries are crispy and flavourful.\n\nI’m curious how much chicken you get in the combo meal as it is listed as a full order, but it’s only $12.\n\nOverall, the food is good, but the customer service isn’t great and they should provide the extra pickles and drinks if it is stated on the menu (would have been no problem for a restaurant with good service and customer appreciation…plus, a couple of tablespoons of daikon won’t break the bank).\n\nI’d go back to Chicko Chicken, just not to this location."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPTUBvjl44yMnI7tNtMNS4MKjreUIxKh7un_YEI\u0026fid=0x0:0xcda159c61221d78c""],""When"":""2022-3-24""},{""Name"":""Carolin Chen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6UTw8MiPD4lMns2KEwQKDCBNWoS11pESIXB034eh8riDIAVWn=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""If you're a fan of delicious fried chicken, then you absolutely must check out this restaurant.

I do love an A\u0026W teen burger but they are NEVER hot! In fact, they are always lukewarm. I have even asked them for a hot, fresh burger but I never get it. I see the burgers come out and they sit there while the staff members faff about doing other things. For some reason they let them sit and sit and sit before delivering them. Well, I'm sick of cold burgers! So I was very pleasantly surprised by this hot fresh burger on a warm fresh bun delivered the way I ordered it (no mustard or ketchup).

It comes in a cool cup which is reusable!\n\nThey also have juicy sandwiches known as Banh Me, but I had the Mapo Tofu Bowl as a savory dish. The nice soft tofu pares well to the delicious rice it is topped on.\n\nLet me tell you about the Cheaty Bubboden I ordered:\n\nThe Cheaty Bubboden comes with Black beans and is topped with Purple Yam and Almond Milk making it the perfect mixture. (and vegan)\n\nThey can replace everything with lactose free or almond milk! Also they put amazing Mango Jelly in it and served it with the dried ice wow! The Skewers are fresh, handmade and the selection varies daily\n\nLocated at Dunbar Community \u0026 another good thing: they are open every day!\n\nAlso a big shootout to the staff: amazing customer experience!

This location of Tim’s has the best staff by far out of all other Tim’s I frequent. However we must address the corporate level issues on the food. I just ordered 2 hash browns and they were not palatable. They tasted freezer-burned and were barely warm. Even if they were warm enough that frozen freezer burn taste would still be there. They are clearly the same hash browns we can all buy in the frozen food isle and they have that same frozen taste when we make them at home- so we know. You think this is acceptable to charge people for? Why do McDonald’s hash browns taste so amazing? And made in a way we cannot replicate at home. I ate one of my hash browns today and it was so gross, I took one bite out of the second and could not believe I was charged $2 each for this frozen tasting not edible food. I went to the counter to complain and explain but instead of hearing what I was saying they just offered me 2 more hash browns- that made me angry enough to complain in this way. Your food is unacceptable now and barely edible and when people are honest and complain about it they should get a refund- not more inedible freezer burn-tasting replacements. Customer service needs to be back to Canadian standards. You complain and they truly are too deft to understand what you are saying in order to rectify it."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Eric"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLTx21jQ3ixOeedWHFc3zDSy4yNyoRockoqEhp4ukWBqSAO1A=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""UPDATE *Scroll down for original review*\n\nThey are now being extremely pushy upon taking your order that you go to google reviews at that moment and leave a five star review.

For the management of this particular franchise: good reviews are supposed to come organically and a reward for proper service and good food. This is not how you pump up your google review score. Do better.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nUsually this place is decent to grab a quick bite, but when I came in today at noon on the 10th of October, I could not believe how unfriendly everyone behind the counter was. It was so bad that I nearly felt the need to apologize for merely having my presence in the store at all.\n\nOn top of that, the gentleman who was in line before me had to go at extreme lengths to convince the people behind the counter to remake his order when they made it wrong, despite very clear and easy to understand instructions. It was a little hard to watch.\n\nNot to mention that they don't give receipts when taking orders, so when they start calling out order numbers, no one knows which one is theirs.\n\nUltimately, customers shouldn't feel the need to apologize when making a purchase in store as it should at least be a marginally welcoming place to be."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""priya aryan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWhujY_qvoDTSZ3DP97_yKAaQm8JxpQCMGH0Nq4gNguul5LMBRz=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My second time Review.\nIt's been 5 years, am a regular customer  for tea.\nFood is amazing.\nAll seasons whole team are very quick in helping with orders, friendly and very welcoming.\nStore Manager  is great lady💜\nI recieved  great service  from Hui, prince and other girls.\nMy favorite TIMMY  store,my neighborhood\nVery lovely Team!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sam Jafton"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLXFQ-6itxsd8z47x7lufVpEcdEYrXgfRlYBbJ56y6QBxE1Kw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I have been going to this Tim Horton everyday for the past 2 years.

It's a good thing it was only $20 and a part of it went to donation for children, otherwise I'd be asking for my money back. The only flavor I could taste what's the Tomato sauce, which was sweet! It's like someone poured a bunch of sugar packets on it.\n\nDon't waste your money, if you want real Pizza just go to a proper Italian restaurant, just avoid this entire franchise completely cuz no matter where you go it's not worth the money even when it's on the cheap deals."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""jogn wood"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIHeyzidMpgdTdyID-q90KGoADC5i2X4TU7x2hviP2zgOVW3Q=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I’ve been coming to this location for over a year.

She politely listened and answered to my questions and told me I can exchange the chickens if next time I get poorly cooked ones. However, the taste is very poor compared to Chinese KFC, and quite mediocre among western fast food here, and she said I am the only real person complaining, “all the other one star come from the same IP address”and stuff… So, if you are a fan of Chinese KFC, be prepared for a big downgrade. The coat is too salty and the meat is too plain because the CA store use different spicing methods and probably don’t pre-season the meat itself.\n\nAlso, the chicken drumstick was overcooked, too salty and texture is dry and rubbery. The other one was okay, it is somehow juicy, but still… The other western fast food shop heard about my story and gave me a free chicken strip, and that one was much more tender, juicy and taste much better… and chicken wasn’t their specialty. I’d say this KFC still has some space for improvement.\n\nAlso I asked if the coleslaw salad can have salad dressing aside and they said yes but it was mixed in. The person who gave me chicken was nice and friendly through. You need to ask for Napkins at the front. I don’t understand that they don’t provide napkins as a fried chicken shop cause “it gets messy”. If kids want to get messy they can use your drink fountain, toilet tissues or even utensils…  I failed to see a point of making people to ask for napkins without knowing there was an option."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPtCDGABQzGsZcStci9KkMlC_D6FzfpmQ11cdmi\u0026fid=0x0:0xea570e8490b3ec11""],""When"":""2024-2-29""},{""Name"":""Byron Sheardown"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXNqxb0c_42J36yKVRNJaOWQgsDJlMUDs94sxLG_b3F9RGXTQ_D=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Friendly staff.

It's absolutely amazing. 🍄 🍔\n\nMy favorite part was the fried pickles—crispy, a bit spicy, and so unique to Fatburger. I love them. 🥒 🥒\n\nAs always, it was a 5/5 experience. The store itself was classy and cozy, just like a true burger place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN_Mjoy36gJ7OdDde04AL38tOhkIz5pze_hvWXu\u0026fid=0x0:0x9c90436389022f45""],""When"":""2024-10-19""},{""Name"":""Jeff Bridges __"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWtVlLKTd4RyKHbiBdT3FiG002D7yHnionCIXHvFpH38aYHdoKh=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""personally, the prices are very high.

The root beer was using the frost chilled mug which was a good idea to keep the drink cold without ice melting to water down the drink. However, this location spilled the root beer outside the mug without wiping it clean. The root beer got frozen on the outside. It then melted while I put it on my table, creating a mess.\n\nWhen I was picking up my food, I saw no napkins nor they were provided anywhere I could pick up. I asked for some. The lady pointed to the tray on the oil-stained single piece of napkin unfolded lining under my onion rings. I was surprised not to be given any extra napkins when asked in any branded food chain store.\n\nThe lady who took orders had no smile all through. I seldom cared much about this kind of thing, but together with the above issue, I could not help but taking note of it.\n\nThe food was good though.

These were some of the best mussels I've had in a very long time.\n\nMarguerita Pizza was tasty but more cheese would have been preferred.\n\nEggplant Parmigiano far exceeded my expectations. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about ordering this dish. The last time I ordered eggplant in an Italian restaurant, I found that the eggplant was not as soft as I had hoped it would be, and was very much lacking in flavor. Not the case with this eggplant dish. My husband tried my Eggplant Parmigiana and he was blown away by it as well.\n\nLinguine Alla Vongole and the Fettucine that came with my Eggplant Parmigiana had both been cooked al dente and were accompanied with very flavorful sauces.\n\nIt's been awhile since I've had a good Tiramisu, and this was definitely a good one!\n\nIn most respects the service was decent; however, we were a bit turned off by response our server gave when one person in our group inquired about the chocolate cake they were serving for dessert. He asked the server if she could describe the chocolate cake. Her response seemed to imply that it was a stupid question to ask. As though we should already know from the name of the dessert, that it's a cake and it's chocolatey. The question was asked though in the hopes of receiving information that might describe whether it was moist, or dense, or filled with chocolate ganache, or whether it had a crunchy wafer in the middle, or whether it was covered in chocolate buttercream frosting. Our server's response was quite a turn off.

Red Robin and White Spot do not stand a chance. Maybe Fatburger could stand up to them, but I haven't tried theirs before.\n\nReview:\nSomeone on Reddit said that this is where you go to get the best milkshake in town. I was rather skeptical that some little corner store in the heart of the Downtown Eastside could hold that title, so I decided to try it for myself.\n\nThe milkshake costs $6 (compared to Red Robin milkshakes which go for $7). It consists of 3 scoops of ice cream, an unknown white liquid that is probably cream, and maybe other ingredients that I didn't notice. There are about 16-20 ice cream flavours and you can pick up to 3 of them. They make the milkshakes in front of you for your viewing pleasure.\n\nI personally had the Strawberry + Vanilla + Mango milkshake and it was simply DIVINE. The thickness was perfect and it was very smooth and creamy. I would 100% recommend this if you're in the area and looking for a milkshake, however I don't think it is worth going on a journey to visit unless you're some sort of adventurer.\n\nThe location and ambience is certainly not the best, but you'd likely be a fool to think that a place in the DTES smackdab on Hastings is a place that you'd go to for a comfy atmosphere. However, the owner and the employees are pleasant and friendly folk. I walked into a \""Hi, how are you, my friend?\"" once I entered. Great attitude! I overheard some chatter and apparently they've been around for about 20 years now.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're a curious milkshake connoisseur."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM6UbvsG1FDkaHOdDhgmm2Ka7xxXc9HRrsx0zyj\u0026fid=0x0:0x641e3eb6d33ef898""],""When"":""2022-4-27""},{""Name"":""Kelly Hrelja"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUVWh8qmVdPEfqahFaQ6ox93SOukCBaQIQqwS9jEApuOOnHfC4ZzQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I honestly love this place and have been going semi-regularly for about a year and a half.

In all, a very small price to pay for their fabulous foods \u0026 drinks. :)"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

my family last Saturday afternoon. I ordered two sandwiches, and when I mentioned that there was an offer, she told me to place the order online. I did as instructed and sat down to eat. While eating, my child spat out part of the sandwich, saying there was a foreign object in it. Upon checking, it turned out to be a piece of steel wool. When my child informed the staff, she responded that it likely came from the bread. I was shocked to overhear this. There was no apology, and the attitude was as if it wasn’t their problem since it came from the bread.\nBoth my wife and I went back to speak to her, and even then, we received the same response.

My family have been dining at White Spot Kerrisdale for nearly 30 years! I used to come when I was very little and now my daughter (who is 3) experienced her rite of passage with the pirate pack recently! I was blown away by the sheer portions of every dish including her pirate pack and the cute menu/colouring page she received. They have many options for the pirate pack now! The vanilla bean ice cream was also of exceptional quality, which surprised me.\n\nI usually order the Legendary burger with extra Triple-O Sauce and subbed sweet potato fries but this time I threw good sense to the wind (my weight watching sense, that is) and ordered a 6oz bacon cheeseburger with subbed poutine and an extra side of tartar sauce as a dip!

The Sweet Soy Sauce especially was delicious, though I wish there was a bit more anchovy paste available.\nFor dessert I opted for the Yakgwa, which was pretty good, nicely presented and served with some gelato to cut trough the honey which was a really nice touch. On the other hand the coffee was not particularly good and I suggest diners to stick to the iced variety rather than the hot one.\nOverall it was a really good meal at a fantastic price in a nice central location which on its own should earn 4 to 5 stars but what really pushed it over the edge was the fantastic work of Yeaji, the host, who was kind, knowledgeable, polite and super efficient while remaining really respectful. Dishes came out fast but she always had time and attention to give a little explanation and guide me trough the menu despite the lunch rush. Never had to wait for drink refills or the bill and had overall a great experience. I hope he goes to big places in her food service carreer. I'll be the first to admit im not the biggest tipper due to financial reasons but i just tipped 11 dollars on a 40 dollar lunch and would do it again in a heartbeat.\nOverall a great experience! Check it out if you are in the area and even if you are in Marpole, Kits or UBC it might be worth the detour on a lazy afternoon. They are switching over the the Fall Tasting Menus for dinner service (various options between 40 and 120 dollars from my understanding) and I cant wait to be back"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPgzrxPZdUBI9cWp4xLdl7UkYWoTZvf3i164RvV\u0026fid=0x0:0x84d2a175c35e3d9a""],""When"":""2024-9-4""}]",

The warmth and friendliness of the staff enhance the intimate, spotless setting, which hums with the lively energy of satisfied diners—many of whom are Korean, underscoring the authenticity of the experience. Given the restaurant’s popularity, reservations are a must, as the wait can extend up to 45 minutes. However, patience is richly rewarded. Each meal typically includes a comforting bowl of Miso soup, steamed rice, and an assortment of traditional Korean dipping sauces.\n\nAs a frequent visitor, I can confidently say that their Bulgogi is unrivaled, and their variety of fried chicken is nothing short of perfection. This evening, we ventured into new territory with their Bone Broth, which was accompanied by crispy rice crackers and tender gyoza dumplings—an absolute triumph.

Many of them are now over 75 years old and they are the loyal customers who visit the cafe every morning. As a new face to the people, I was warmly welcomed. The customers know each other like family members. The vibes made me feel like home there.

When I finally got here, I was a bit confused because the place looked like a coffee shop (not a Thai restaurant).\n\nAs it turns out, however, they do have a full Thai menu inside the shop and we wound up ordering the Sampler Platter ($15.99) as well as Green Curry Chicken ($13.99) and Pad Thai ($12.99). This appetizer platter was really good and had all of the items that we enjoy… spring rolls, chicken satay, fish cakes, shrimp cakes, and deep-fried prawns.\n\nThe green curry chicken is exactly what you’d expect from a full Thai restaurant and had tender eggplant, bamboo shoots, red and green peppers, and Thai basil leaves. As expected, the curry sauce goes very well with a bowl of white rice.\n\nThey use tamarind sauce in their pad thai (instead of ketchup) and this version turned out pretty good.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food in this little coffee shop. Service, while adequate, was a little bit more in line with what you’d expect at a coffee shop than at a sit-down restaurant (we had to seat ourselves and also flag them down to order and get take-out containers and then pay up front at the cashier).

Gravy was excellent fries or what you expect. Coleslaw as a staple and I seem to remember being glow in the dark green when I was a kid and they seem to have tuned the colour down quite a bit, but still the same type of very finally chopped vegetables in a creamy sauce.

Was really in the mood for a classic Donair Dude donair. Used Google maps and found this location which I've never been to before. They had a lot of different dishes than other locations however the prices are pretty high. They know it as well because an employee saw me looking at the menu and unprovoked she began to explain that they use grass fed beef that is why the price is high. I ordered the $15 beef pita wrap anyway because I was very hungry and didn't want to bother going somewhere else. When they asked what veggies I wanted, I started with \""lettuce\"" to which the employee corrected me by saying \""cabbage\"". Huh? No lettuce at a donair place....ok give me the cabbage then 🤷 when I started eating the donair I noticed that the beef was diced up even smaller than the veggies! It looked like cat food. I don't know how this place can be under the donair dude name when it's this different. Maybe some of their other food is good?? I don't know but personally I won't be back.

The quality was shockingly low, leaving me unsatisfied and disappointed.\n\nFirstly, the protein content was severely lacking. It felt more like a garnish than a substantial part of the meal. I expected a hearty portion of meat, but instead, it was just a teaspoon of grey, unappetizing substance that resembled cat food. This was a major letdown, especially considering the reputation Donairs typically have for their generous servings of flavorful meat.\n\nThe visual presentation was equally unappetizing. The dull grey color and unappetizing texture of the meat left much to be desired. It was far from the appetizing, succulent image one would associate with a Donair.\n\nOverall, my experience with this Donair was extremely disappointing. I was left wanting for more in every aspect - from the protein content to the visual appeal. I would strongly advise against visiting this establishment for a Donair, as there are certainly much better options available elsewhere.\n\nIt's a shame when a beloved dish falls short of expectations.

The crispiness was on point, but having jo flavor really shine through this burger, I was left sad and feeling like I had a fish filler at McDonalds. The ceasar was the most disappointing salad I've had. So I started nibbling on my friends dishes.\n\nPrawn Spinach and Mushroom Fettuccine:\nDry. More like a dry pasta salad with some shrimp. The prawn was decently cooked, but once you're done with them and left with the rest, it's exhaustivdly dry. She's didn't even finish her dish, just a few nibbles that's it and left the bowl full.\n\nFries:\nAverage\n\nOkay so let's be real, I just ate at a burger style Denny's. Price was moderately higher for this quality of a meal. I'd rather stick to my more trusted restaurants.\n\nWorth it, if you're hungry it's a fun place and service was spectacular.

owner’s response I found it to be pretty defensive.  There is an ego at play here saying “if you don’t like don’t buy” is a pretty rhetorical point to make since already indicated I likely won’t be back the next time I’m craving the familiar taste of Donair.  I also did not say the basmati rice was bad, I was simply just saying that it wasn’t what the palate was anticipating.  An appropriate response would have been “thanks for your feedback, and we will take it into consideration as we continue to receive feedback on our service offerings” without the need to commit to anything since I’m just one customer and not the owner who gets to exercise their own prerogative.  Some more growth and maturity is required on the part of the ownership.\n—-\n\nThe visit (original post):\nService was polite.  Food was a bit disappointing. The rice used was basmati and it had the fragrance of indian food, which while nice was a departure from what this food should taste like.   All platters are $17.95 and most other places charging this price would follow your container to the brim. I found the portions here quite stingyyz would also help to have feta on the salad and turnips available.\n\nI enjoyed my food well enough.  The sauce was also great (“as expected”) but something about it just felt really underwhelming for the money I am parting with. Probably won’t be back the next time I’m craving donair.\n\nThey also have violated the single use plastics ban that has been around for over a year (since December 2023), in terms of the cutlery.  The take out containers are made from compostable corn starch, however, these were also banned starting July 2024. A quick chat with the BC OPI on this file confirmed that indeed these packagings and cutlery are no longer permitted in BC as of the dates stated.  The owner’s response is that they are approved all over Canada.  Apparently, owner you don’t understand that while federal laws supersede, more specific provincial laws can also apply if they carry more nuance.  The federal statutes set a baseline.  Ownership Needs a lesson in Canada’s constitutional fabric and history.\n\nAll violations can be reported any time to plastics@gov.bc.ca with the name and address of the business and photos to substantiate the claim."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMCJ4YsAbfJ24vYwCOg6-EZ2Lo9WmneYc0Fr2eV\u0026fid=0x0:0x1eb5beeadc5f6d94""],""When"":""2024-12-6""},{""Name"":""Haranmol Sidhu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKYMAAWNVb-SA_Vn5-etruI0jR0fgujcpmUFXkhPuAV59_Sig=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""This is the worst donair ever had .

I ordered pesto with linguine. For the price the servings are quite small. The restaurant has no indoor seating that is comfortable to eat at.

They do have some outdoor tables for summer time dining. After receiving food, I ate it in the car as it was too cold to eat outside. I decided to save a bit for lunch so I finished the rest of my pasta today and when I got to the last bite I bit down on something very hard… I quickly took it out of my mouth and it was a sharp jagged piece of plastic. Thankfully, I did not swallow this piece of sharp plastic or it might have been a trip to the emergency room.

Mount Pleasant vegetarian burrito/taco restaurant, and a good alternative to the big brand name burrito joints for plant-inclined eaters. The staff are very cool as is the vibe.\nI've tried a few things here: the Johnny O, Blair Stanley, Jo June, and Poser in either burrito or bowl form, and also the vegan chocolate chip cookie they offer. The Poser so far is the clear winner - the ground round was nicely seasoned. Jo June was alright but blander than expected given that it's made with stewed poblano peppers. I did really like the Johnny O, but the chipotle sour cream is what ties it together, so I’m not sure if the vegan version would hit the same. In general, the burritos/bowls lean toward the “stuff thrown in a bowl together\"" vibe rather than a cohesive dish to me. It's okay but not something I'd crave. Similarly, the cookie was fine but didn’t wow me. I probably wouldn’t get it again, but I just don’t care for chocolate chip that much unless it’s got something special about it.

Favourite was the Jamedog burrito bowl (GF option) for the garlic and lime roasted potatoes. The guacamole is a worthy $2 add on! They were able to exclude certain items due to ingredient sensitivities. The burritos are $13.50 regular price, and they're massive! Very filling and packed with ingredients between the rice, beans, and protein. 1 burrito could be split into 2 meals easily. The only critique I had was the cabbage is relatively dry by itself, and definitely needs a sauce or sour cream (or in my case, guacamole) to liven it. Hopefully they are able to offer vegan sour cream in the future!\n\nThere was a slight miscommunication on our order and the staff was kind enough to let us keep the item made in error. The interior was retro and colourful (we loved all the details in the seating area downstairs) and the 2 staff members were great and patient!

From the tantalizing array of beers to the scrumptious burritos, each offering is a testament to culinary excellence.

Each location of Steamworks has its own menu, and this one didn’t disappoint!\nWe visited during Happy Hour, which is a big plus since they offer it every day!  The Happy Hour menu has a decent selection of food and beers, making it a solid place to grab some drinks and snacks with friends.  You can check their website for details, but trust me, it’s worth it.\nThe patio is pet-friendly, which was a nice surprise, so we got to dine with our furry friend while enjoying the laid-back atmosphere.  The space is larger than it looks from the outside—plenty of room to relax.  The vibe is a classic pub setting, though the music can be a bit on the louder side, so keep that in mind.\nAnother great perk is the Costco gift card deal!  We spent $80 to get a $100 gift card and were happy to learn that we could use it during Happy Hour as well.  Overall, it’s a great hangout spot with a welcoming vibe.

Interior is quite bright, i’m a fan - it has a fun, casual vibe. We came on a Tuesday and the place was relatively busy (the place is small), so I’d recommend making a reservation or calling in advance.\n\nWe ordered the salted egg yolk chicken wings, straight outta Bangkok (sub pork belly with prawns), lem@k’ing good chicken and purple haze. The salted egg yolk chicken wings were pretty solid and well fried. Batter was light yet crunchy, not too oily and chicken was moist. My only feedback is that I wish it had a stronger salted egg yolk flavour. The straight outta Bangkok was essentially a pad thai. It didn’t mention being spicy, but I found it to be a medium spice level from the peppercorn. I felt there was too much sauce as it was too strong (salty and sweet) and there was nothing special, I’d say this was my least favourite dish we ordered. Chicken curry was very good - I’d recommend ordering a bowl of rice with it. It reminded me of a Chinese curry where it’s on the sweeter side, with a mild spice. The flavour of the curry was on point and the chicken absorbed the curry flavour very well. Lastly, the purple haze, which I also really enjoyed. It had a sweet glaze, mild spice and was quite garlicky. The eggplant was cooked well (great texture) - even the non-veggie lovers at my table were a fan of this dish.\n\nI would say the flavours to most of these dishes were quite strong, predominantly a sweet and salty combination. Portion sizes were enough where for 3 people, where we all left quite full. I do wish they had some more basic dishes like Laksa or Hainan chicken, which may be on their lunch menu but that’s just my personal preference. Service was quite average and I do feel like the price was a tad high for how casual everything is, doctoring in ambiance, how the food looks and service. Would I came back? Yes - I’m curious about their lunch menu. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP4Tj8W9XsU89v5b7ipKNZIPVL4h4EXARqlGcw3\u0026fid=0x0:0x95ea3092b47bad5d""],""When"":""2024-8-21""},{""Name"":""Snoopy Kitchen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU3h-I-trbYva-Tzrs-UNhkQe4Nn1jgsblAcoQ0hPrnUWvugM3Y=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Refreshing Singapore/Malaysian small restaurant.

The noodles were incredibly delicious and authentically Chinese, with just the right amount of spice to elevate the dish without overwhelming it. The flavors were spot-on, and the beef was tender and perfectly seasoned. I enjoyed it so much that I finished the entire bowl and found myself still craving more.\n\nWhile I’ve loved most of the dishes I’ve tried here, the spicy beef noodle has definitely taken the top spot on my list.

I called to ask if there was a none spicy version and the lady said they recently changed their powder so all chicken has a hint of spice. I wouldn’t say it’s a hint. My child couldn’t eat it. So if you are adverse to spice I would stay away. Go to a place that has no spice in their base batter.\n\nWe ordered half half. While this refers to flavour, I would say there’s half large chicken chunks and half crispy bits.

And the guy at the counter said they don’t have that too. How weird? Probably lazy staff."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Fresh Donair’s new branch on Robson Street is a gem that truly delivers on taste and quality. The moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by a bright, welcoming atmosphere. The staff was quick to offer help with the menu, which showcases a variety of mouthwatering options. Still, it was their chicken and beef platter that stole the show for me.\n\nEach component of the platter felt meticulously prepared. The chicken was tender, carrying a balanced seasoning that highlighted its natural flavors. The beef was equally stellar—juicy, lightly spiced, and cooked to perfection. Even the sides were on point: the rice was fluffy, the salads were fresh and crisp, and the sauces offered just the right tangy or spicy twist to elevate every bite.\n\nIt’s not often you find a spot that nails both quality and quantity, but Fresh Donair does exactly that. The portions are generous, enough to satisfy a hearty appetite or split between two people. On top of that, everything comes at a fair price that doesn’t feel inflated for a Robson Street location. You can sense that value and customer satisfaction are high priorities here.\n\nWhat really stood out to me, aside from the delicious food, was the cleanliness and attention to detail. The dining area felt spotless, and the staff clearly took pride in keeping everything tidy. It’s comforting to see a place that cares about more than just great taste—Fresh Donair also ensures a safe and inviting environment for its guests.\n\nFor anyone looking for a top-notch halal option in Vancouver, Fresh Donair on Robson Street is a must-try. The environment is welcoming, the food consistently hits the mark, and the service is genuine. I left feeling completely satisfied and excited to return, eager to explore more of their menu. If you haven’t checked out this new branch yet, make it a priority. I’m confident you’ll walk out thinking you’ve found a new favorite, too.\n\nIn a city as diverse as Vancouver, it’s refreshing to find a spot that delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNPQlsnvqCaWCsXX88puK7xCTVuuUSk90NR2FHI\u0026fid=0x0:0x2d91dbc13c2f81ba""],""When"":""2024-12-25""},{""Name"":""Hugh Holtz"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLnMF127VyUqWPMyGLShLF1ZAm5tCY9_nmrmqVXl6PFsNcINA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It just opened today, and we thought we’d give it a try.

Previously a donair shop, a family seems to have taken over selling fried chicken. They have seats but currently only accept takeout. You can order at the door through a speaker, or online. The father/husband seem to be in charge of the entire shop while the wife is feeding a little child and keeping them entertained. You can watch TV while you wait for your order.\n\nWe got a full flavored chicken(cheese) and half crispy. We got a side of fries with gravy. A side and a drink comes with your order too so we for mac \u0026 cheese. My GF pointed out that they also fry mars bars, which is kind of hidden away on their menu. Their entire menu is just boarded to the wall outside.\n\nThe chicken is so good! Its like korean fried chicken, and a good value too. The chicken is bone in and just hacked up in big chunks so expect to nibble some bone(i prefer this because i think its fun to do). The cheese powder is kind of sweet, and theres dried herbs mixed in. Crispy chicken is good too but id probably just get flavored next time.\n\nFries seems to be those battered fries you get from costco. If you have had those then you know what to expect. Gravy is a little lumpy. Mac \u0026 cheese is just KD, it's a little under-seasoned.\n\nThe chicken i think is the highlight and everything is made to order.

noticed that 2 new comments with five stars were written right after I put a review out. One says that it’s written from a UBC student but we were the only ones in the restaurant. Really??\n—-\nI came here with my friend for the first time because of the high reviews, but I was very underwhelmed by the quality of food.\n\nWe ordered 1 Carbonara pasta with 4 beef balls and a Creamy Pesto Sauce as well. The lady taking our order was extremely rude, holding her arms together most of the time (not even a proper eye contact too).\n\nThe portion of the pasta we got was smaller than expected, and the pasta sauce was very bland. I was also expecting actual beef meat balls for the protein, but it felt like eating processed, microwaved meatballs.\n\nI can’t believe all of this including the mango lassi costs $56. We even tipped which made it $64 but we both felt that the food was not worth the price.\n\nThe only good thing was the mango lassi. It tasted good, but not worth the price considering it’s around $6 for a regular cup.\n\nOverall, I’m extremely disappointed about my experience here. I noticed your team sends auto-generated responses for customer feedbacks, but honestly it really doesn’t reflect well on your new customers."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipObiPeftIl5M13d-Zi5CL5dxWo1asSNBVO640QA\u0026fid=0x0:0x903faab4aef83611""],""When"":""2024-10-21""},{""Name"":""Priya Seenivasan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJMhKuaV0UByu_19lq9S8Z0RymGWLGeMkZW32FqcwJdXwdJC4O6=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The food was very tasty and the portion sizes were very generous for the price.

It had good portion of the cheese curds \u0026 popcorn chicken. I would order the gravy on the side next time because the dish was salty overall.

I didn't realize how much the lettuce and tomato balanced the meat and rice combo. Now it is too dry yet also sort of greasy (not sauce) to eat. No freshness. Not for me anymore. I always get take out, as inside feels grubby, the floor is sticky when you walk. That kind of things always makes me wonder what the cleanliness behind the scenes where your food is made is like... Without the salad it is a spoon of meat and two spoons of rice with a sprinkle of slaw so very overpriced at $13. It is the size of the palm of your hand for reference.

Very warm atmosphere, from the design of the inside to the friendly service. Because the place is relatively small, it’s probably not a good idea to bring a large group, but it’s a nice place for a smaller hang or even to chill by yourself. I have been curious for a while and just tried it with some friends. I probably will be back.\nThey have a great drink menu with lots of specialty cocktails and nonalcoholic drinks. I got a nonalcoholic pineapple guava soda. I don’t like drinks that are too sweet and this was good for me, but some people might find it weak compared to commercial fruit sodas.\nI got a soup and sandwich combo as my entree with the Eggplant Caprese sandwich and the Crab Bisque. I really liked this take on a caprese sandwich, and the baguette was very fresh and soft. The bisque was very good too. Rather than being a super creamy bisque, this was more tomato-based and a little tangy. Good flavour with a fair amount of crab meat. I also liked the little side of coleslaw that was included in the combo.\nWasn’t really planning on getting dessert but then I saw they had a Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding, and I will rarely pass up on bread pudding. It was delicious but, as you might expect from bread pudding made of banana bread, with ice cream, with caramel sauce, VERY rich and heavy, and I had to get some help to finish it. I think this would be ideal for splitting between two people.\nFor this meal, with tip, I paid $48, which surprised me. I thought it was a good meal, but not $50 good - I’d associate that kind of price with a more upscale experience than this. I can understand the soup and sandwich pricing, the dessert was a little expensive, but what really strikes me as obviously overpriced would be the $8 soda. I understand it’s made in house, but it was just a fruity soda - no fruit bits or anything fancy, and no alcohol. It was a nice refreshing drink, but for $8 I wouldn’t say it was worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMA-33yhxlhuJWzrEmE3NBivENZ-qwhvFcoFjxN\u0026fid=0x0:0x57c0ba4874667b57""],""When"":""2023-5-20""},{""Name"":""Keith Ver"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXVdqxLCf1LEt0AU82myo-eUqDcb2LcbdnfhupJTEW0sPAQ-qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Good food and good service!

This establishment prides itself on prompt service and observant staff, showcasing an unwavering dedication to guest contentment.

As a dog lover, the inclusive pet-friendly policy significantly enhanced our dining experience, contributing to the overall laid-back vibe of the place.\n\nThe outdoor seating area presented a slight hiccup, as only half the tables benefit from the shade, either natural or via umbrellas. However, after a short wait, we managed to nab a shaded spot for our meal.\n\nA point worth noting is the slightly elusive location of the restrooms, hidden within the upstairs hostel. This required a minor search, but the overall experience outweighed this minor inconvenience.\n\nThe charm of DICED lies within its simple but well done menu. The irresistible Cuddle burger has managed to capture the hearts of many, including mine. The unbeatable combination of delectable flavor and affordable pricing make it a standout choice!\n\nA crucial aspect not to be forgotten is the cafe's commendable work within the community. Functioning as a social enterprise, DICED invests in shaping the future of young adults in the culinary field. Every delicious meal served is a testament to their commitment towards empowerment and opportunity.\n\nTo top it off, we found free street parking just one block away, saving us the usual parking hassle.
