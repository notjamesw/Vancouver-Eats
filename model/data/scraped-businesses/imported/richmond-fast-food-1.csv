I highly suggest the owner reconsider their staff. I won’t be returning to this location. It's embarrassing to see such poor customer service, especially when the people in my community seem to have lost basic respect and professionalism. The woman with the turban and the man with glasses working the drive-thru were particularly unpleasant.\n\nIf the restaurant isn’t able to fulfill orders, they shouldn’t accept them. And if they do, they should handle the situation with patience. It's unreasonable to tell Uber drivers not to accept orders during certain times, especially since the Uber app doesn't notify us that all McDonald's locations are closed or updating their policies between 4-5 PM. This is a problem that both McDonald's and Uber need to address—it shouldn't fall on Uber drivers to figure it out.\n\nAdditionally, the woman with the turban refused to speak with the customer when I called to inform them that the order couldn't be completed.

grilled chicken burger at Fatburger, but this time I decided to try the Cajun chicken burger with cheese for a bit more flavor. The chicken breast was fresh, and the portion size was decent, but the overall taste was just okay—nothing particularly memorable. It had a mild Cajun flavor but lacked the punch I was hoping for like some more onions, bell pepper, and some spiciness was what I was hoping for.\n\nThe restaurant itself has plenty of seating, so finding a spot isn’t an issue, even during busier times. The price is reasonable, falling somewhere between cheap and pricey, making it a decent option if you're looking for a quick bite without breaking the bank.\n\nWhile combo meals are available, I didn’t opt for one since I’m not a fan of pop or fried fries. If you're into classic fast food sides, those might round out the meal better.\n\nOverall, Fatburger is an alright spot for a casual meal, but for the price and taste, it's just a middle-of-the-road experience for me. Not bad, but not outstanding either—solid 3 stars."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMikO8JQiH485lV0QbBLoL_JNEpZGb7opiJLKTl\u0026fid=0x0:0x5c4ad3db271c6112""],""When"":""2024-10-2""},{""Name"":""Heechan Kim (Philip Kim)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUXUfLhUh5dMO1jOrNGAdjzrGu6EsZB1cv1RlI6OZ4TObUi7lBW=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""If you want classic American Burger, this is the place where you can get them.

It merits a score of 9 out of 10.\n- **Calamari**: While the portion size was modest, the seasoning was impeccable. It earned an 8 out of 10.\n- **Chicken Wings**: These wings were outstandingly meaty and flavorful. They rightfully deserve a 9 out of 10.\n- **Rib eye Steak**: Though it could have benefitted from a pinch of extra salt, the overall quality was impressive. It receives an 7 out of 10.\n- **New York Steak**: well-balanced seasoning, this steak was a delightful dish. However, by the time we finished the appetizers, it was not as warm as it should have been. It earns a 7 out of 10.\n\n**Ambiance**: The restaurant provides a spacious and cozy environment, making it an inviting place to dine. The interior design strikes a balance between modern and comfortable, contributing to a relaxed dining experience.\n\n**Service**: The service was adequate, with staff members being generally attentive, though not exceptionally so. Improvement in timing would enhance the overall experience.\n\n**Price**: The pricing is reasonable, offering good value for the quality of food served. However, the overall value would be rated at 3 out of 5.\n\n**Verdict**: Moxies Richmond Restaurant is definitely worth a revisit. The food quality is high, and the ambiance is inviting. The only area for improvement is the service timing. By the time we finished the appetizers, our steaks were not as warm as they should have been.\n\n**Summary**: Moxies Richmond Restaurant offers a commendable dining experience with its delicious food, cozy ambiance, and fair pricing. The slight service hiccup is a minor flaw in an otherwise positive experience, making it a restaurant worth returning to."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPw6Iep1PTAq6vg97ou2EkfH8Z_rw7shDDqSKM4\u0026fid=0x0:0xf4303da5897c1038""],""When"":""2024-6-25""}]",

I don't even know how to describe it other than delicious.\n\nWhen the bill arrived we noticed the deserts were missing. We called Michelle over and asked if she had missed them. She explained that she felt bad for our situation and wanted to do something kind for us to make our situation better! She also made a joke about wanting us to remember Vancouver in a good way! Well, we definitely will. 😊 I'm so glad we found 75West that evening. It had been a long and gruelling two days of travelling and that meal/experience more than made up for it. We were in Hawaii for a week and it was the best meal we had eaten.

This is takeaway-only as there's no place to sit, and there's a table for standers but the place is really too small to support anyone eating in.\n\nBecause the hotdog is covered with rice mochi, it doesn't feel very heavy or oily, even when deep-fried.\n\nI tried the half sausage, half cheese dog.\n\nI liked the mozzarella in it: The mozzarella comes out soft, stringy and melted, which goes well with the crunchy shell.  It's very comforting/feel-good to eat.\n\nThe beef hotdog inside isnt anything special, it doesnt taste like 100% meat, it's just kind of soft processed meat... But the outside of the dog makes up for it. So the meat is definitely not costco hotdog level, it is almost like luncheon meat texture, so that could bother some people. It wasn't meaty enough for me. (Probably a typical \""American sausage\"" texture in other korean/asian food places too when they incorporate foreign ingredients, like into hotplates and hotpots etc. Its supposed to be a bit light i guess?)\n\nNext time ill prob try something with the chicken in it to see what it tastes like too.\n\nExtra toppings come at a price, I think $1-2 extra.  But\nthere are many sauces and cheese/butter powders for free you can choose that they put on for you. I think i took some chipotle mayo and bbq and some of the powders.\n\nPopular place for young people as it's also hard to find any takeout food under $10 that actually tastes good.

Richmond certainly knows how to draw a crowd with their National Burger Day BOGO deal.\n\nThe initial service was commendable, with a server who was both attentive and friendly, setting a positive tone for the meal.\n\nThe nachos, however, were a letdown, lacking the robust topping variety one might expect, and while the cheese quality surpassed that of Good Co, the absence of salsa left the dish feeling incomplete. The smash burgers, a highlight in theory, fell short in execution with under-seasoned patties and disproportionately large buns that detracted from the overall moisture and flavor.\nThe fries, too, were a disappointment, promising crunch yet delivering a softness that defied their well-cooked appearance.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the restaurant filled, the attentive service waned, with a noticeable delay in receiving the bill. Observations of other staff members attending to tasks while my server was overwhelmed suggest a potential mismanagement of duties. This experience leaves one pondering the disparity between personal experience and the glowing reviews Cavu Kitchen Bar has received."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO6_X3uyaS0PsCnyoMPkXmBxzbp3rrTSI0fLxKY\u0026fid=0x0:0x9a24da6028bc44b9""],""When"":""2024-6-18""},{""Name"":""Reilly videos Games"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIDebdSxW4i3fCCuDyEg4qjUboi7kZm60BzHcCT6gi5MHuU-w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I decided to throw my husband, a surprise 50th birthday party and CAVU popped up in my list.

Dharm \u0026 Rishi communicated very well \u0026 right away each step of the way. They are so accommodating including menu options, set up and small request here \u0026 there were all assisted in a very timely and smooth fashion. Their staff was friendly \u0026 helpful and had smile on their faces the whole time, we had a lovely bartender throughout the night (shoutout to him for being so kind and generous! He was the cherry on top of our night) and everyone was as thankful as we are- such a positive environment to be! The ambience is restaurant style but had that classy vibe that makes you feel that you are in a special place. The food was all delicious, it was a buffet and the food was filled all the time, plus the staff at the carving station had this great welcoming smile when he was serving the food. Parking was free for everyone as well which is fantastic. I got a lot of compliments from my guest, thanks to Dharm , Rishi and their Cavu Restaurant team- certainly made my husband party more memorable \u0026 special than it already is. As for the price, it is unbeatable and very affordable, amazing places like this still exist! It’s definitely a hidden gem in Richmond and I highly highly recommend everyone to support restaurants like these who strives to provide amazing service while being mindful of the prices they ask from their customers.

I went back and nicely asked for some gravy to be put on the cheese because it was super cold (even though I prefer not to have soggy fries) and she said in a rude tone of voice that it’s obviously cold because the cheese is in the fridge. And I was surprised because obviously everywhere they keep their cheese in the fridge and they serve poutine warm / hot. But said it was super cold nicely trying to explain and again she rudely answered, … I was like may you add some hot gravy so it heats up (even though I actually *hate* soggy fries) and she again in a rude tone of voice said it’s 1 dollar for extra gravy. Lady, you shouldn’t be serving gross cold food first of all!!! The woman’s attitude was horrible and NO actually, in my whole life I was never served poutine where the cheese was super cold- ever in my life. Absolute worst poutine and the woman who works there shouldn’t be serving people food, she has a horrible attitude. Didn’t eat much because I didn’t enjoy it - but most of all just left with a bad memory. Some people need to think of why they push so much negativity on to others. Don’t have a good photo cause I only take good photos when I want to post on Instagram (and I didn’t want to post this memory) but here’s on now before I throw it out. Cost co poutine is way better, and cheese is actually melted and not icy chunks. *****by the way, just scrolled down reviews and many many people commented on the lady being rude.*****I see reviews of her double charging, or charging for a fork that was dropped by someone who ordered 6 poutines… embarrassing*****"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOHN_Pxc8ZFRO37xEGS8hKHzEMs8kgu-M4mzmIM\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c48d7a921f94b2d""],""When"":""2024-2-29""},{""Name"":""Beezer333 Beezer333"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX3wo1m-4sufmg5069NtcuAFRSIVJ6amfyY9UrEO5NtVtv3Asyw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Update May 14 2022: gave it another try… delicious!

I asked if I could just have vegan cheese on a regular cheeseburger and they had no issues making that substitution. The burger was juicy and had a lot of fillings for a reasonable $11.50. It’s definitely an upgrade from your typical fast food chain burger and doesn’t cost very much more. I think though the highlight of this place though was their vegan milkshakes. I avoid milkshakes like the plague because I always have stomach issues from them, but this milkshake tastes every bit as creamy and flavorful as a normal milkshake!

to 24 Train Express Noodle House prompted us to try this Vietnamese restaurant in Vancouver. Intrigued by Vietnamese cuisine's reputation for authenticity, we focused on traditional dishes, bypassing the Cambodian options due to lack of familiarity. The Pho Beef noodle soup demonstrated the chef's skill. For allergy purposes, it's advisable to request blanched beansprouts. The lemongrass-infused broth rivaled our previous Vietnamese experiences. Fried chicken wings, a personal staple, were also enjoyable. Compared to other Pho establishments in Vancouver and Toronto, this restaurant excelled, though still falling short of Vietnam's exceptional Pho.\n\nExploring small eateries can reveal unexpected culinary delights, unearthing hidden gems that merit attention.

That's when I found 24 Train Express, which fit the bill. It has a mix of Vietnamese and Cambodian cuisine, the latter of which I haven't had a whole lot of experience with. To start, we had the cha gio. Since we just wanted to try it, we just got one roll and I'm glad because one roll here is actually the size of about 2.5 regular rolls. It was a little oily but well made with lots of filling, and it was crispy. For my main, I had the pho sate - specifically well-done beef with beef balls in a lemongrass broth. I really enjoyed it, even though it was well done beef (couldn't do rare since I'm pregnant) and I loved the broth. Hubby had the chicken thighs over \""fried rice\"". I say \""fried rice\"" because it was really just white rice with some sauce poured over it. The chicken was also dry, and it should be hard to overcook chicken thighs. But it didn't taste fresh. It tasted like they reheated it. He said the veggies it came with were also not fresh. Maybe he just ordered the wrong thing since this is a Noodle House, after all.\n\nI would still give this place four stars, based off my meal and the cha gio.

other two Pokérritos in Vancouver and had good experiences. This was my first visit to this location and my first time trying the namesake pokérrito. Compared to the locations on W 8th and Hornby, this location is more optimized for takeout; the seating is just stools at counters along the walls and for me the counter was awkwardly high compared to the height of the stool. It was also a little loud. If you’re just getting takeout it doesn’t make a difference because the food is consistent between all locations, but I would recommend the other location downtown (or the W 8th location if that’s in range) for a more comfortable dine-in experience.\nI tried the Diamond Head pokerrito and subbed out the spicy tuna for the vegan tuna. It’s still not a vegan meal if you do this because there are other seafood ingredients in the wrap, but I wanted to try the vegan tuna. It was delicious but very messy because the pokérrito is essentially a giant sushi roll and not sealed at the ends. You kind of have to keep it wrapped in the paper while you eat it but there’s no graceful way to eat the ends. I really enjoyed the flavours of this even if I had to get my hands dirty though. The vegan tuna is pretty good. The texture is close enough to real tuna that I wouldn’t have noticed it was different if I didn’t know.\nI also got a tiramisu. When I ordered, the person making my order informed me that it was still frozen but it was still good frozen, like ice cream. So I decided that I’d try it and it was pretty good as a frozen dessert except the large ladyfingers at the bottom were slower to soften and hard to scoop out. The coffee soaked into the ladyfingers was pretty strong and the bitterness was a nice contrast with the mascarpone cream.\nTheir prices are very reasonable.

My friend came a little later when they sat down, the waiter was so fast in saying \""You cannot sit there.\"". Those were his exact words. Excuse me?!? They also commented, \""I have to change everything if you sit there, so you cannot sit there.\"" Like if it is so inconvenient for you, at least you can ask nicely. But no, they had to make back handing comments for something they shouldn't be able to dictate.\n\nWe each ordered an entree and also ordered appies to share for the table. The waiter repeated multiple times, \""Who is paying for the appetizers?\"". They were rude and demanding. We didn't make a scene regarding our treatment by the waiter because we were with old coworkers. I guess this restaurant is inexperienced in splitting the cost of items. I've never had any issue splitting cost of items/bills in any restaurant besides this.\n\nThe food is below average. Steak doneness was not correct. Ordered rare, came medium.\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant if you have a large group. They won't be able to accommodate.

I usually read reviews before I even attempt to walk into a place unknown.\n\nI must admit, the reviews are right! One of the best places to get fried chicken. No disappointments.\n\nI got the 10 piece Family Meal (10pcs chicken (half/half), \""Family\"" (large) fries, and medium gravy).\n\nThey have the right crispiness level for both the spicy and regular, surprising as I usually have to order the spicy in order to get that satisfying crunch. Anyways, the spicy is quite light on the \""spice\"". The fries were good, although I like my fries extra crunchy; they were soft to bite into but still had a crispy exterior. The gravy. What can I say, but wow! It's actually made with a roux (flour, fat). I've never in my life experienced real gravy when ordering fried chicken. Needless to say, that's some tasty gravy 🤤\n\nI was told to wait 5 minutes when ordering, and that's what I got. My regular chicken was still piping hot when I bit into it 10 minutes later. The spicy one was still hot, but had cooled.\n\nOverall, what a pleasant experience. I didn't even get the prompt for tipping as there wasn't one 😆. You honestly can't argue with the price. I've never ever gotten a 10 piece, large fries, and a regular gravy for $35 or anywhere close to that. Go to Churches or Jollybee and it's easily $10 more.\n\nSuper friendly, counter staff. Fast service and you get what they say.\n\nThis might just be my new go to place whenever I'm in the area. Gotta watch the weight though 😆\n\nOne thing that you might want to be cautious of is if your parking there. It can be a little on the more compact side. Still space between cars, but watch out when someone is pulling out."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM3NKh3PtuLLTvb4Q7FPShhGm0F4tcbLDsBn6kQ\u0026fid=0x0:0xe62738cec803c0cd""],""When"":""2024-8-16""},{""Name"":""Niloufar Mazaheri"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKmR0rPTwq_DXIA1sLSHbkEVQL8L1x3WSgef_K_PkmOFLMBlA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We had heard from a friend that LA Chicken was supposed to be good, which is why we went there, but our experience was the exact opposite.

The washroom door was left wide open, adding to the overall unappealing atmosphere. When we arrived and saw the dirtiness, we became hesitant, but having driven all the way from Vancouver to Richmond and being so hungry, we decided to order anyway. In hindsight, I wish we hadn't.\n\nThe food was absolutely disgusting. We ended up throwing more than half of it away and went somewhere else to eat. We ordered half thighs and half breasts, but we didn’t get any thighs. What we received were mostly bones with barely any meat, and what little meat there was didn’t taste like breast meat at all.\n\nI generally love fries, but the ones here were terrible.

We picked Captain Wa simply because it seemed more people buying from them. Perhaps also because it was right at where people come out from the parking lot. They also seemed to offer more dish options.\n\nThe portion is very generous like what it was famous for. We chose sweet and sour pork, stir fried beef with mushroom, onion and celery (mixed vegetables), and Sou sauce chicken. The lady was so nice that she gave us a bit of extra broccoli.\n\nOverall the food tasted quite good. Sweet and sour tasted what it supposed to be. Pork was rather fatty, but not too bad. Some of them might have more fat than meat.\n\nStir fried beef with vegetables was alright. The beef was good. The typical texture you would expect at restaurant with a tiny touch of baking soda. It is difficult to not to overcook beef at home. One of the mushrooms was very big and might could have used more time to cook. There were not many slices of beef but mainly vegetables. It ended up a good balance as we only ordered meat.\n\nSoy sauce chicken was a good surprise. It tasted as good as those from a bbq specialty shop. It was still tender and juicy. If we come again, we will definitely want to have this again.\n\nFor the combo, you can choose steam rice, fried rice or noodle. We choose fried rice and it was pretty good, not greasy at all!\n\nWe ordered two juice drinks, one mango and one is guava. They did not taste very good. We would recommend to order those soft drinks that you would normally drink.\n\nWith a three-dishes combo and two juice drinks, it costed $22. It was totally a bargain and a treasure in the times of increasing cost of grocery and inflation."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMUytulLu3pin9OhsE099KMm3Oyr_mp-3QRA8-0\u0026fid=0x0:0xf534f50c4e8da542""],""When"":""2023-9-17""}]",

Previously came here for an order of fries a little past 3am, they gave me my order from the window and disappeared, I took a look in the bag and grabbed a fry out and it was cold and stale. They had the audacity to serve this to a paying customer and expect them to accept it without saying anything? I honked my horn to get their attention to no avail. I honked a second then a third time, then she came back to the window and asked what’s wrong, I told her the fries are cold and stale. She took the bag back and said to park and she would bring out another one without even checking the condition of the fries, that tells me she knew it and was hoping I wouldn’t complain about it.\n\nThis time around I went before 7:30pm, ordered a large fries, received from drive thru and drove 2 blocks away and then opened the bag to reach for a fry and it was once again, not fresh and tasteless. Pulled out the box and to my amazement it was not even half full. I’m guessing it was what was remaining in the fry bin before the next fresh fries were coming out of the fryer. I would have driven back back was going to work so no chance to but I had to write this honest review of this location after my last 2 experiences here. Corporate should really educate their employees at this location and prioritize food quality/taste over giving them leftover/almost best before serving to their customers. This place gets a ZERO stars from me if I could give them that.\n\nVictoria and Kingsway location is miles ahead of them in terms of food quality, customer satisfaction and overall just being pleasant.\n\nReading most reviews for this location is pretty on par with my experiences here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOqXAmwatTkwwAPhkmAnBnMs2jPljdnpKk4xeWX\u0026fid=0x0:0x102de80539c1e5d2""],""When"":""2024-7-22""},{""Name"":""Mark Royer"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUCTBWZctKVbXLo_R3by2XLM-2T6Iq-7HPq6SIpzj-7QYb96YKp=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Stopped for a quick take-out meal.

I got the Elk Burger and I got gluten free buns as well. They actually tasted surprisingly good. Could hardly tell they were gluten free. Didn’t have that chalky texture and the burger itself was nice and soft too. Usually elk has a much tougher gamey texture. The aioli was a nice touch as well. I’m just like everyone else. I hate spending more money at the airport too, but don’t let slightly higher prices deter you.

Unaware of any ongoing activity, I proceeded inside.\n\nDespite the apparent preparations underway by the two staff members, I couldn't help but notice the lack of customary greetings when I approached the counter. Having worked in the fast-food industry myself, I understand the importance of customer service standards. It seemed that such basics were being overlooked, perhaps due to inadequate training or management oversight.\n\nOpting for a special and a small coffee, I was taken aback when a homeless individual approached me, asking for spare change and even food. While I sympathized with his plight, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease about the situation.\n\nReflecting on the broader societal issues at play, I couldn't help but attribute some of the blame to governmental shortcomings. The decline in our communities, businesses, and overall trust can't be ignored.\n\nAs my order was handed to me, I couldn't shake off the feeling that proper hygiene protocols weren't being followed.

place out for a while.\n\nGlad I finally found time to visit, and I'm not disappointed at all.\n\nOrdered the Super 10 (chicken), and the 12' soft burrito (beef) combo. The ingredients in the soft burrito were nice and fresh. The tater tots were really well done. Light and crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.

Restaurant\n\nAddress:\n104-10151 No.3 Road, Richmond, BC V7A 4R6\n\nFood\n\nCream Soup and Luosong Soup\nThe meal began with two soups: cream soup and luosong soup. While both were warm and comforting, they offered nothing beyond what one might expect from similar Hong Kong-style cafes. The flavors were passable but lacked depth or distinctiveness, making them feel generic. A decent start, but ultimately forgettable.\nRating: 5/10\n\nBaked Seafood Rice\nThis dish was a major disappointment. The rice lacked the richness typically associated with baked seafood dishes, and the flavors were bland and uninspired. The seafood components failed to shine, leaving the dish tasting flat. It’s a dish that neither satisfies nor warrants a recommendation.\nRating: 2/10\n\nHot Plate (Three Items)\nThe hot plate featured AAA New York sirloin, gillette fish fillet, and pork skewers. The steak, paired with a well-executed peppercorn sauce, was the highlight of the dish. Unfortunately, the remaining elements fell far short. The fish fillet, though generously sized, was bland and lacked seasoning, while the pork skewers were unremarkable in both flavor and texture. This dish showed promise but ultimately failed to deliver consistency.\nRating: 6/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe ambiance is functional but lacks character. While the space is clean and organized, it feels generic and uninspired, offering little to enhance the dining experience. The setting is sufficient for a quick meal but does not contribute to a memorable outing.\nRating: 5/10\n\nService\n\nService was the most disappointing aspect of the visit. A 30-minute wait for dishes, coupled with a lack of communication from the staff, set a poor tone for the experience. Overhearing a waitress admit that the food wasn’t ready only added to the frustration. When the dishes finally arrived, there was no acknowledgment of the delay or apology, leaving a sour impression. The service felt indifferent and inattentive, significantly detracting from the overall experience.\nRating: 1/10\n\nPrice\n\nThe prices are on the higher side, which would be acceptable if the food and service matched the cost. Unfortunately, given the lackluster quality of the dishes and the subpar service, the pricing feels unjustified.\n\nVerdict\n\nHong Kong Flavor Restaurant struggles to meet even basic expectations. While some dishes, like the steak, show potential, the overall execution falls flat. Combined with poor service and unremarkable ambiance, the experience leaves much to be desired. For the price, diners deserve far better in terms of both food quality and hospitality. It’s unlikely I will return without significant improvements."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPqTlxEedRQE7DISW3D8puAD8LpQohxR-oF7n3q\u0026fid=0x0:0xd747db78de59dfad""],""When"":""2024-11-29""},{""Name"":""Hugo Hui"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFKB7_IX7_zKudRFRoFgVr64qNA-sn37U70tv-FYN7KNfyp9o=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It was a late night, came with my family for dinner.

I have dined in a few times and tried most of their dishes and the taste is alright. Can't say it's \""authentic\"" since I haven't been back to Hong Kong for over 15 years, but it tastes like any other HK Cafe locally. Price wise it's quite good as it is on the lower side of the HK Cafe spectrum. Most of the dishes are decent if you eat it at the store. The service is decent, when they feel like it. There's times I were greeted with smiles and times when I was frown upon. One time I was there and was speaking English, I guessed the waitress thought I didn't understand Cantonese, but she was telling another waitress to give us the bill because we were there over 90 mins, but I already asked another waitress for the bill and was waiting for it. The restaurant was only 30% full at that time. Not sure why she wanted us out. Their milk tea is alright, sometimes too much tea, sometimes too much milk. Taste fluctuates more than my mother's mood. Most dishes are alright but don't get their congee. Their congee is more watered down than the drinks I used to get at the clubs.

Sure, that might be true, but maybe that customer didn't bother to look closely for bugs.\n\nI brought the contaminated food back, and they reluctantly refunded me for the vegetables without a single apology. To top it off, this pathetic excuse for a dish of vegetables and beef cost me $25. This restaurant used to be decent, but now it's a completely terrible Hong Kong-style dump.

Their mapo tofu is better than when I was eating in Chengdu (China). Their appetizer, the flavoured gluten is so yummy.\nMost importantly, when I eat their food I don’t have digestive problems (gassy/uncomfortable) like other restaurants.

Interesting use of pesto sauce (authentic with pine nuts) and pork belly!\n\nI had the pulled duck leg spaghetti with mascarpone sauce and it was sooooo good. Nice and smooth, well balance creamy flavour and the duck was very tender.\n\nWe recently ate at Kissa Tanto downtown and couldn't figure out what the whole hype is about their food. It was good fusion and the service was good, but not great for the price. Broli is a GREAT fusion restaurant, with a great price point for delicious meals. Broli's servers are also very friendly.\n\nFor any tourist in the area, give this restaurant a try if you don't want to compete with downtown Vancouver prices and the headache of parking. Lots of parking here and it's free.\n\nWe also enjoyed the dessert at the end with the pecan graham crumble for the carmel macchiato pot de creme and Lava cake was awesome! Both are made in house and are a great way to end dinner!\n\nHighly recommended!

For $105, I expected a much better experience. The dish was mostly celery—at least 90% of it was just celery and frozen veggies! There were a few shrimp scattered throughout, but they were few and far between. Initially, they charged $90 for a platter but then they called back half an hour later and wanted to charge $105 for the platter of shrimps because the market price of shrimp is much higher now. I felt like I have paid $105 for a platter of celery, when I did not even expect any celery based on the name “prawns with cashew nuts, 腰果蝦球”. This is disappointing. I feel like they cheated us on the quality on purpose because we are not regular customers, and are of a younger crowd. I’ve had better quality and value at other places for a fraction of the price（ie. Parker place food court). It’s frustrating to pay so much for a dish that feels like it’s mostly filler. I won’t be coming back.

The seasoning is well-balanced, allowing the earthy mushroom flavors to come through. However, it lacks the depth or richness that would elevate it beyond a basic offering. Its creamy texture and mild flavor make it a comforting choice, though it remains relatively simple without much complexity.\nRating: 7/10\n\nTomato Soup\nIKEA’s tomato soup provides a familiar and comforting flavor, with a well-seasoned base that balances the natural acidity and sweetness of the tomatoes. While enjoyable, the soup lacks distinctive characteristics—such as fresh herbs or additional seasoning layers—that would help it stand out from standard tomato soups. It serves as a reliable option for those seeking something light and traditional.\nRating: 7/10\n\nVegetable Medallions\nThe vegetable medallions, while offering a decent texture, fall short in flavor. They lack the seasoning necessary to make them truly enjoyable, resulting in a somewhat bland experience. While the dish is a healthy option, it could benefit greatly from a more inventive preparation or the inclusion of a dipping sauce to enhance its appeal.\nRating: 6/10\n\nPlant-Based Balls with Vegetables\nThe plant-based balls are hearty and filling, accompanied by a modest selection of vegetables. While the texture is commendable, the flavor is somewhat one-dimensional, leaving the dish feeling uninspired. A more robust seasoning or a dynamic sauce would significantly improve the overall experience. While suitable for those seeking plant-based options, it falls short of delivering a memorable meal.\nRating: 7/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe restaurant, located within IKEA, offers a casual and functional dining environment. The setup resembles a cafeteria-style experience, where customers line up with trays and select their meals from a counter—evoking memories of high school dining halls. Despite this, the space is large, clean, and cozy, with adequate seating. While the chairs are functional, they are not particularly comfortable for extended dining.\n\nPrice\nThe prices at IKEA Richmond Restaurant are undeniably affordable, which is one of its main draws. While the food selection is not top-tier, the low cost makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious diners. For the price, the overall value is reasonable.\n\nService\nThe service was adequate, though not particularly notable. It follows a self-service model, where diners order at the counter and receive their food. The staff was efficient, but the experience lacked any personalized attention.\n\n6 out 10\n\nVerdict\nIKEA Richmond Restaurant offers simple, no-frills dishes that cater to those looking for a quick, casual meal during a shopping trip. While the food is consistently decent, it lacks the creativity or bold flavors needed to elevate the dining experience. Ultimately, it’s a reliable option for convenience, but not a destination for culinary innovation."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNU7PHXXXsfMSLHGlzfydg9s-jQFhbvXML5_pUa\u0026fid=0x0:0xc8855e3befc7b661""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""eddy wong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8Fjpj3y8teHQ4LqbC4PHR8whbU4-XOrTXEwklI9bGRqZLRD20=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Sign up for a free family ikea membership.\nChoose any 3 entrees at 50% off.\n\nGo lineup.

I didn’t engage with her as there’s lots of people waiting, said nothing else, and paid for my food. After I paid for my food, she scolded at the next customer as well “YOU TOO YOU HAD MORE THAN ONE SCOOP ……” (blah blah blah and went on the whole time the next customer paying for their food).

So I mobile ordered the correct sandwich at 12:49 pm. It said ready by 1:05pm. I have it extra time even knowing how slow there are. Now I have a starving kid needing to eat between soccer games. Now I’m 90 mins into a simple subway stop. I go at 1:20 to pick up the sandwich and it’s not ready despite the app saying ready for over 15mins. I ask. He’s very rude. Says he has a bunch of orders ahead of mine and it will be at least 30 mins. I left and came back. I now got my sandwich at 1:37 TWO HOURS from when these kids first got in line and it’s toasted which it wasn’t supposed to be but at this point he’d eat anything. I’ve never been so frustrated with something so simple. Two hours to get an order is beyond ridiculous not to mention the time commitment and wasted driving back and forth checking in something so simple.

The customer later came back to pick up the order but the same cashier didn’t recognize him and wants to charge him again. The customer insisted that he paid already while the cashier was constantly stating that he didn’t pay and stating that he was being so confused. The customer later came with his friend and stated the same thing. They had paid earlier already. The cashier seems not believing them but gave them the food eventually without apologizing for her attitude and misunderstanding. The same thing actually happened to me too as I came early while the food was still being prepared. I paid for my food and came back to pick up later.

Otherwise, their chicken color should not look like sh-t 🤣 like they do now. If you can look past its color, their chicken is actually pretty delicious. It looks very dry on the outside but is actually quite moist on the inside.\n\n- They don't use white meat, again, probably to cut costs. Their 6-piece chicken that costs $15.75 almost always comes with 4 fair size drumsticks and 2 thighs. We actually prefer this combination.\n\n- the ladies speak Mandarin only. Talk to the guy.

I specifically said no cheese and please just toast the bread before making the sandwich. She starts putting cheese so I stopped her and then she put tuna. I asked her again to please toast the bread before she put in the tuna. She was so upset huffing and puffing and then scrapped off the Tina back into the bin and toasted it.\nI didn’t have any extravagant requests after that but she was so upset because I asked for extra pickles she only added 5 over the entire sandwich. As you can see she just threw them into 1 half of the sand was she did with everything else. She put all the tuna in one side and scraped it across so I had 1/2 a sandwich with some toppings and some missing and the other half overflowing with everything I asked for.\nI would highly suggest finding another subway to go to.

The food took awhile to arrive by elevator. Be warned it can get quite hot upstairs.\n\nOur favourite was the pide cheese. It was the most visually appealing and also tasted the best. Loved the bread and the cheese combo. Doesn't get better than that. The other ones we tried all tasted similar to it.\n\nI would skip the beef wrap and the pizza and just stick with the pide cheese\n\nWe also tried the napoleon and it isn't your standard puff pastry napoleon.

24 2024]\n\n- What do you know? New members spend $30 or more and get $10 off, plus the additional 15 or 20% off 👍👍👍 Membership is free.\n\n- order online and get 15% off. Walk-in gets 20% off.\n\n- they will send you SMS the estimated time your order will  be ready 👍👍👍\n\n- recommend buying one flavour each order. They don't label what flavour their chickens are if you buy two or more flavours. You will be scratching your heads what flavours they are.\n\n- the meteorite chicken wings were pretty good, although we will not order it again. It's kinda pricey for a mid-wing, costing at least $2 each.\n\n[August 18, 2024]\n- Chirpyhut is one of the best deep-fried chicken restaurants in GVA, far better than KFC or Popeye's. Everything is made to order, not precooked and warmed under a heat lamp like KFC or Popeyes's.\n\n- We ordered the $37.99 8-piece \""Drumstick \u0026 Thigh Combo.\"" It also comes with a basket of freshly cooked French fries, a small container of mashed potatoes with gravy, and a can of cola.\n\nYou get to choose one of eight different flavors, including one mystery one called \""含笑半步癲\"" or \""Exclusive Flavor.\"" Non-Chinese speakers would be clueless about the phrase; that's understandable. Even for Chinese speakers, not everyone has heard of it unless you are a Stephen Chow 週星馳 movie fan. 🤣 But instead of \""含笑半步癲,\"" the movie uses \""含笑半步釘.\"" To know what it means, check out the movie \""唐伯虎點秋香.\"" A funny AF movie.\n\n- We very seldom see anyone dine in for whatever reason. Most people appeared to have called ahead and then come to pick up their orders at a later time. We should have done that too, but we dined in this time.\n\n- 20% off if you dine in or take out. No discount if you ask for delivery. Our $37.99 order after the 20% discount came out to $30.40.\n\n- Honestly, the $37.99 price tag isn't worth it. There is a cheaper option: $6.99 for two drumsticks. Eight pieces will cost less than $28. Pretending that eight drumsticks are the same as four drumsticks and four thighs, that means the basket of French fries, mashed potatoes, and a can of cola cost $10? We can live without them. Next time, it will be drumsticks only!\n\n- We should have asked for takeout because it takes 15-20 minutes to cook and another 5 minutes for the chickens to cooldown or it will definitely scorch our lips and mouths. It was extremely scorching hot. We should be able to immediately dig in after the walk home without the need to wait for 5 minutes. 😅\n\n- the chickens were perfectly deep fried. And the \""pepper salt\"" was great! The pepper salt was sprinkled on the skin or batter. The meat inside was quite bland, though. We don't eat the skin, but we peeled the skin with our mouths, thus leaving some pepper salt on our lips. That way, the bland meat can have a little taste too.\n\n- The counter lady was quiet but not without compassion. Seeing me looking around for napkins, she brought a stack to my table without me asking for it. Then, seeing we were finishing up, she came over and asked if we needed a takeaway box for the unfinished chicken. We said no, but she added, \""It's free.\"" We replied, \""Thanks. No need. We live nearby.\"" Unlike what others say, she was helpful, just not very talkative. Asian girls, quite understandable. 😅\n\n- We'll be back on a regular basis for sure!\n\n."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNZlJqEZIsOc87XEpEsdpZI1J4_1dM2yzKNX3sI\u0026fid=0x0:0x8f705ce554605101""],""When"":""2024-8-18""},{""Name"":""Jay Why"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWf6qVrRB2FWSP3f_QpdYqgSMlmFo0fYvO9JkGkahstgPZxGBo=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Chicken was good.

hotspot for donair enthusiasts, and trust me, once you've had a taste, you'll never look at donairs the same way again.\n\nThe donairs are a work of art – think soft, pillowy pita bursting with the freshest, most flavorful meat that's been spinning on the rotisserie to savory perfection. Each bite is like a flavor explosion that'll have your taste buds doing a happy dance. And the platters, oh man, talk about a feast! They pile on all the good stuff – juicy meat, fresh veggies, and sauces that'll make your taste buds tingle with joy.\n\nBut what really sets this place apart is the freshness. I mean, we're talking about ingredients that are as fresh as can be. It's like they pluck the veggies straight from a garden and the meat is so tender, you'd think it was carved just for you.\n\nAnd the location? Right smack dab in the middle of downtown Granville. It's the heart of the city, and this donair joint is like a food oasis in the bustling urban jungle. The vibes are alive, the energy is electric, and the whole experience is just downright unforgettable.\n\nSo, if you're on the hunt for super-good donairs and platters that are as fresh and interesting as they come, you'll find your haven right downtown on Granville.

I've been waiting for almost five months since I first saw their signs, and it officially opened about a week ago. It's located inside the Lelem Village, which is great because there's a nice outdoor space where you can sit and enjoy the summer. There are also outdoor games available there.\n\nThe staff are nice and kind—I asked for additional sauce, and they happily gave it to me, so I'm giving them a 10/10 😛. The quality of the food is the same as at all other Popeyes locations: it's nice and tasty, perfect if you enjoy fast food. Everything is orderly and clean, and you can order ahead using the app and pick it up when you get there.\n\nI definitely recommend their hot wings and butterfly shrimp; both were really nice and tasty. Try all the different sauces—personally, I prefer the buttermilk ranch, but I also like the Cajun cocktail sauce, which is pretty unique to me.\n\nI'll definitely try more and update my review if anything changes. 🍤 🍗 🍟\n\n[Update, 2024, September]\nIt's been a while since I posted another review, but everything is still just as good. They’re now available on their website, and you can order ahead. The rewards in the app could be improved—they don’t quite match up to others, but still better than nothing. This time, I ordered the classic chicken burger along with fried onions and mashed potatoes. The onions are on another level—I really love them. The mashed potatoes are a bit spicy but still tasty. As for the burger, I personally prefer it with a bit of ranch, but honestly, with or without, it's still delicious.

We noticed a girl laying against the wall of the building who seemed very intoxicated or drugged. We stopped to check on her as their was a man with her trying to make sure she was okay.\nAfter quickly discovering, the girl was non-responsive, eyes rolled back, dead weight, ect. From talking with the man who claimed to be her boyfriend, he mentioned they came out of the business called \""Moulin Rouge\"" which was a bar/night club vibe to where she was laying to the right of the entrance of the building if you were to exit the bar. I quickly started yelling for the employees to get first aid and for someone to call 911. The employees of \""Moulin Rouge\"" were completely useless. They claimed they did not have first aid or had anyone who could assist until the ambulance arrived.  We also had a employee say to us \""Go move her over there to die\"" as it was causing a scene for everyone entering the bar. They continued checking people in and ignoring the whole situation. At this point, we have the boyfriend doing CPR compressions, a member of my group calling 911 and giving all the information to the dispatcher. My main concern, is this business does not have proper safety protocols in place. We don't know if they kicked her out so they wouldn't have to deal with it as it would not become their \""problem\"" if she was no longer in the establistment. She was overserved alcohol, or drugged or all of the above. It was a very tramautizing thing to see and to see how the business would not help when she came from there."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNIIzUUZTZXFSt5HqkIfb9TcxvS4ZtiYKggBBRe\u0026fid=0x0:0x18a8c92d2e52e602""],""When"":""2024-10-28""},{""Name"":""Peter Mills"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXfOplcWDGvSRU1qOLz7QzHUzXmsnFocxnjeEfHxxQXoNpHzlB0Jg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Go anywhere except here.

I do love an A\u0026W teen burger but they are NEVER hot! In fact, they are always lukewarm. I have even asked them for a hot, fresh burger but I never get it. I see the burgers come out and they sit there while the staff members faff about doing other things. For some reason they let them sit and sit and sit before delivering them. Well, I'm sick of cold burgers! So I was very pleasantly surprised by this hot fresh burger on a warm fresh bun delivered the way I ordered it (no mustard or ketchup). Too bad the fries were lukewarm because they seemed like good fries. Also better than Mickey D or A\u0026W. So that was lunch for $6.

Ofcourse i was right— the second lady preparing our fries put Cheese instead of Sour cream. She wasn’t reading the receipt that’s why she gave me one wrong order which is meant for the other customer.\n\nThe thing is, it wasn’t even that busy when we ordered.

A small causal place for quick dine in or takeout. They were very accommodating and accepted our reservations for a group of 12.

Food was pretty delicious overall especially the Huli Huli chicken. Nice caramelized flavour with moist and tender meat. The garlic shrimps were cooked well and had a little spicy kick to them. The Loco Moco was probably my least favourite. It was just a bit too salty for my taste. Overall an enjoyable meal. Staff was really nice and gave each kid a Hawaiian lei.

Small little shop with a few tables inside. Dishes are generally served up like the plate lunches that you find in Hawaii. Kind of wish they had more environmentally friendly containers.\n\nThe garlic shrimp is served shell-on (gotta make sure to suck all the flavour on it. Served with rice and their version of mac salad. Overall good flavour but shrimp are kinda small if you compare them to the garlic shrimp you get in Hawaii. The sauce is a bit more thick and savory.\n\nReally enjoyed the huli huli chicken. There was a nice caramelized sauce on the skin and the meat was nice and tender.\n\nOne complaint was the spam musubi. The rice was hard and crumbled apart (kind of reminded me of rice that's been sitting in the fridge). Not sure if that was a one-off thing.\n\nUpdate: revisit in mid October. Ordered the huli huli chicken again but also tried the Maui beef ribs. The ribs were plentiful and saucy (although some pieces were a bit tougher to chew through). A feel like the chicken was better on our first visit - think they didn't sauce it enough (mental note to ask for more sauce next time).\n\nUpdate: March 1, 2024\nReturned for a revisit in early March. The huli huli chicken was as good as I remembered (especially with the sauce). We were trying to decide between the Maui beef ribs and the pork ribs so they gave us a pork rib to try.  Definitely the Maui beef ribs were much better."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOPZpkaS8Uk_zZB5MxCXiDxOMlX9KFa_AWxlnuv\u0026fid=0x0:0x3017e03aba3cdad8""],""When"":""2023-8-5""},{""Name"":""Mackenzie Biggar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvOHHjIsRsUfCLYuXKWpnpVyZIW755hk0GRJEmXglHx4jTxPTM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Mahalo from a Steveston local!

Make sure to ask for some dipping sauce for the rice which is served plain. My husband had the Huli Huli chicken meal which came with the same as above - he gave it a solid thumbs up as well.

favourite brunch spots in Richmond. The food is always fresh and delicious and they have a great selection of hot and cold drinks. My favourites have been the chicken and waffles, truffle brisket Benny, and the hearty breakfast. The garlic hashbrowns are delightfully crispy. The truffle brisket Benny was exploding with truffle flavour. I’m obsessed! The little side salad that comes with your meal is simple, fresh, light and so tasty that I always eat every single bit of it, and I’m someone who usually ignores a side salad. Service is always friendly and efficient and the place seems well cared for. If you love hot sauce, you’ll love the options here - there’s at least 14 different kinds. The only downside is that there aren’t many tables in the restaurant so they can only serve about 8 or 9 groups at a time."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMW-gdL1y91Fn8bgmqV9sTq6pvqyRX4AyP4KS3z\u0026fid=0x0:0x27adf75c5ce9570a""],""When"":""2024-11-17""},{""Name"":""Philip Raymond Lim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV5EIBAgpBLsauhPMdjXym7mJ4fA8mtryDtWQIJCZfJxYXxupU8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Finally made it to Chef's Playground in the beautiful town of Steveston.

that specializes in curry rice, and I was really impressed with the overall experience. One unique aspect of the place is that they use ramen noodles with their curry broth. While the noodles become a bit too soft from soaking in the broth, it doesn’t take away from the flavor. The broth itself is rich and flavorful, as it seems to have been enhanced with stock, making it incredibly satisfying. Paired with an onsen egg, the dish reaches a perfect balance of texture and taste.\n\nI ordered the fried oyster curry rice, which quickly became my favorite. The moment I bit into the oysters, the fresh, briny flavor of the sea burst in my mouth—it was simply delightful. Another standout was the fried chicken curry rice. The chicken had a perfectly crispy exterior with tender, juicy meat inside. It was easily one of the best fried chicken cutlets I’ve had recently. The portions of both the curry and rice were generous. For first-timers, I recommend starting with the regular portion, and if you’re still hungry, you can always opt for a medium-sized portion, especially if you can eat a lot!!\n\nThe ordering process was super convenient. Each table has a QR code, so you can order directly without waiting for a server. While the restaurant was a bit crowded, it’s a typical atmosphere for a Japanese curry shop. The rice they use is imported from Japan, and the quality really stood out—it paired perfectly with the curry. We each spent around $25, and we ended the meal with a fried pumpkin pie, which was the perfect conclusion to a great dining experience.\n\nOverall, I had a fantastic time and will definitely return.

They give you an apron to wear to keep your clothes clean and offer performances to keep you entertained. The shelves at the tables provide a smart option to hold more dishes in a small space, and they offer wet napkins at the end of your meal to clean up with.\n\nThe menu isn't the biggest I've seen but offers a variety of choices for all. Ordering the hand-pulled noodles will give you a table side performance of a piece of noodle being twirled and stretched before being dropped into your soup. Most of the items were good except for the beef tongue, which was on the tougher side.\n\nI really enjoyed the mask changing performance. It was very well executed so you couldn't see how it was done and exciting to watch up close.\n\nService was good. They unload your dishes from the robot to your table and even offered to peel our shrimps for us. They also check in periodically to make sure you're getting all of your food.\n\nThe biggest drawback was the price. I've never been to a hotpot restaurant that charged you for the dipping sauces and the cost for the dishes was a bit on the higher end."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNPRaZc1e70WAHMfreU6fldM7dzr_TGLbHOKjyR\u0026fid=0x0:0xf740f260acdcd6e5""],""When"":""2024-8-4""},{""Name"":""Rae Wong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXludIfvxP0lSashqAP6J43sWBimKhhDxCMUWR6u1Oxcwk0m3TvVA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Had an amazing experience at Haidilao Richmond!

because it was the only McDonald’s that had every part of our order available!!!\n\nI always use the app to order as it’s a great way to avoid queues, plus you get points which transfer into free food which is a great bonus.  On this occasion, all our local-ish restaurants had something missing from our requested order so we decided to have a little drive out to Catterick. Upon arrival it was clear to see it was  busy, however we found a table and requested food delivery to that table.\n\nFood arrived quite quickly considering how busy it was but it was just the food; no straws, no napkins; no sauces. Wasn’t a problem as I just went and got some from the self service area, but did think it was a little bit lax as you do expect these items delivered with your food, even when busy.\n\n8yr old had standard 6 nugget medium meal with vanilla shake plus a Maltese McFlurry. I had a medium mccrispy deluxe with vanilla milkshake and a cream egg McFlurry.\n\nMccrispy was packed with salad, was very nice, apart from all the salad making it a bit lopsided. In addition, the sauce was only on one half of it meaning that the other half was a bit dry. Maybe nitpicking but just being honest.\n\nParking: lots as part of a shopping complex area.\nToilets: Clean and smelt nice.\n\nWas a short drive from the A1 so a nice little stop off if you’re on a long journey and don’t want to stop at a motorway service station."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNpvBJB7SXVu_kY2UDGAmELc7uF8UJ0rP34nfYM\u0026fid=0x0:0x2f0bf41550a3bfa8""],""When"":""2024-4-23""},{""Name"":""David Dickson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWIHa5zw40dQ2J1knWcY9A5Rf6BeoUMoBNpddSKje_8EecKdhaA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""I ordered a large hot chocolate drink, and a medium coffee arrived.

There I found my order , coffee getting cold and no one bothered asking me even if I was already standing by the Mobile Pick up. I will be forgiving if it was crazy busy but it wasn't and staff were just chit chatting. Today, went straight to mobile pick up because I'm not sure if the staff will call me. Waited patiently and saw my order being prepared. (The counter order which i think I was about 5min ahead since I placed my mobile order was served ahead of me) I was standing there waiting for the staff up call or ask me but my order was just placed down and was left beside the machine. So I need to ask if that order is for me which was definitely mine.

The squid arrived hot, with a crisp exterior and well-balanced seasoning. The flavors were satisfying and memorable. 9/10\n\nCentury Egg and Shredded Salty Pork Congee:\n\nAmong the extensive congee offerings, I chose this variety. The congee was creamy and well-seasoned, with a generous amount of ingredients packed into a small bowl. The portion size was ideal for a light bite without being overly filling. 8/10\n\nAmbiance:\n\nThe seating was reasonably comfortable, though unremarkable. While the establishment was clean, there was an unpleasant odor lingering in the vicinity, which detracted from the overall experience. The source of the smell was unclear, but it did impact the ambiance. 5/10\n\nService:\n\nThe service was adequate, meeting expectations but offering nothing exceptional. It aligned with what one might anticipate from an establishment of this nature. 5/10\n\nPricing:\n\nThe pricing structure is mixed. While the congee was reasonably priced, the main dishes were slightly on the higher side. However, portion sizes were fair given the cost.\n\nDrink:\n\nIced Almond Milk:\n\nThe drink menu offers a wide selection, but I opted for the iced almond milk. It was refreshing and enjoyable. 7/10\n\nVerdict:\n\nI would consider returning, primarily due to the convenience of the 24/7 hours and the availability of parking.

We arrived Vancouver at 3am and drove straight to No.9 to satisfy our late night HK food cravings.\n\nTheir menu is a thick chunky booklet and I was impressed by the insane variety of food they serve. No wonder it has been a neighborhood favorite for over two decades.\n\nI don’t really eat at late night, so I only had half of the sandwich and a few sips of the milk tea. The corned beef egg sandwich (鹹牛肉蛋治) is the best I’ve had in North America, comparable to those in Hong Kong. The bread was lightly toasted, and the scrambled egg was so fluffy and loaded with corned beef.\n\nHK style milk tea (港式奶茶) was rich and creamy. It came with a big glass so it justified the price.\n\nI was also craving for something hot and homey at midnight. I got the ginger steamed milk (薑汁燉雙皮奶), hoping it could recall the taste of my favorite cha chan tang (Australian Dairy Company) in HK. The texture was apparently not super silky and smooth, but good enough to cure my homesick."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNzA69FIc44zXCGVu6udNRKTif0KiI8-vNrjRCe\u0026fid=0x0:0x723922f9bf29f56f""],""When"":""2024-7-2""}]",

Every single add-on, like cheese, olives, and jalapeños, came at an extra cost. Even the wrap didn’t come with the platter—it had to be purchased separately.\n\nThe way this restaurant operates seems to reflect a sense of greed, overcharging customers for subpar food. On top of that, it’s upsetting to hear that the hardworking employees don’t even get the tips they deserve, as the owner allegedly keeps them all. I’m not connected to any of the staff, but I feel deeply for them and the Canadians being ripped off here.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend Donair Dude to anyone.
