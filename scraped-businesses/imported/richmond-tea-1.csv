I remembered clearly at the time of ordering to check for their closing hours to be sure that I can pick it up on time and that they weren't closing early for X'mas (both the Google hours and their main website said at the time of ordering that their store closes at 7 pm/ regular hours so I proceeded with ordering).\nWhen I got to the Richmond store on Dec 24th at 4:15 pm, I then realized from the sign posted outside their door that they actually closed at 4 pm. I want to thank the staff that they still opened the doors after hours when I knocked, thank you to one of the ladies who called her manager to let her know about the situation and thankfully, in the end, I was able to still pick up the order but I want to raise a few concerns here:\n1) I would not have ordered from Paragon if I knew ahead of time that they were closing early or I would have arranged someone to pick up for me. I have done my due diligence to check for their holiday hours on the day of placing the order. Their holiday hours should have been posted on their main website given that they have an online ordering system on this site and they have order pick up available on xmas Eve (even until today, Dec 24th, the holiday hours aren't posted). The hours on google were not updated until the day of. The receipt also does not indicate pick up deadline. I raised this concern to the staff at pickup that their hours aren't updated and her response was that this is posted on Instagram. There shouldn't be an assumption that all their customers follow  their Instagram or that their go-to would be to check Instagram for their hours, especially when there is a store website and the Instagram account is not the first link that is attached the Google business page. I could not find a phone number to call either to give them a heads up or inquire what to do in this case.\n2) It would be appreciative if the staff could have called the customers who did not pick up their orders (or even called 30 min before closing which some other stores would have done) or sent an email regarding this which will highlight more professionalism here. When asked about this, the staff answered that they have too many orders to call the customers (which is interesting because do they have many orders left behind by customers who do not pick up their order for the day they ordered for).\nIn summary, I still want to thank the staff for taking their time for helping me but I hope the store understands the frustration for a customer who is trying to rush from work and hoping to gift the cookies for an X'mas dinner. This could be handled with better customer service and professionalism."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPp2nBWzmJi7dbcF5UHsZFQaWmDwVsqNjavRLr3\u0026fid=0x0:0x2a1f74f49a19358d""],""When"":""2024-12-25""}]",

We are like fine, as we are chatting and don’t want to interrupt and stand up again. When we are about to leave, after we pay, the young lady asked the question “ can you give us the reason that why you didn’t tip?” I was in disbelief, first, I did not receive any service from you (except for passing the food to our table ) secondly it’s up to me whether to tip you or not regardlessly. I just can’t believe someone questions me like this and I felt really offended, for someone who always tip according to the services they provided. Maybe I’m wrong that’s this tea house suppose to operate like this. I’m too old for this generation perhaps. My recommendation is that just go for the tea in the place, if you want to eat something please prepare beforehand for this extra tipping together being treated with disrespected attitude."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kitty"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUhMuwg_tl1TRTc24JxH5iTo3OJVTHqCQijM2P6PldLkYJ1Idkn=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great place to catch up with friends.

I met up with a friend to catch up, and we made a spontaneous decision to go to Miion instead of the cafe next door, drawn in by the cute interior. However, we started to regret our decision decieved by appearance as we sat in the cafe and witnessed multiple (10+) errors with peoples' orders and transactions. There is no doubt that the staff were kind, but the service was just not efficient. Many times staff would make a drink and call out to ask who ordered it, finding out nobody did. They brought drinks to other tables in to-go cups when the customers had asked to dine in. They also brought a steamed milk to another customer who did not order it and did not realize he was accidentally charged for it. Although they do have the confusion of take out and dine-in customers, there are only 3 small tables in the cafe. I think they need a better system, i.e order numbering system to keep track of who ordered what items. We also observed that the staff kept switching roles from making drinks to working as cashier, so there was not smooth communication and knowledge of orders.\n\nMy friend and I had ordered a matcha cream cheese muffin to share and two drinks. They had brought the muffin first but we wanted to wait for the drinks to have it together. It reached the 1hr mark of us sitting in the cafe and we still had not received our drinks (it already took 30mins to receive the muffin despite them only needing to remove it from the display case, not reheat). We asked the staff where the drinks were, and they told us that they were still making them. The woman we had asked returned to us 5 minutes later and ask us what we ordered because they had in fact not started making the drinks. She then asked us to go pay for them, when I explained that I already had. After this, we recieved the drinks about 10mins later.\n\nI have never seen genmaicha so green before and I initially thought they had mistakenly made a matcha. I was amazed that it tasted so fresh yet had the nuttiness of the roasted rice. The matcha was even more vibrant and smooth, not astringent at all. The matcha cream cheese muffin was cold but moist and creamy, and the matcha flavour was actually strong, leaving a nice aftertaste. In many other matcha desserts, they taste too sweet with too little flavour even if it appears green. If their food/drinks weren't so good I think I would've had to give them 2 stars.\n\nThe seating of the cafe was very limited with about three 2-person sized tables. There wasn't much space to put our jackets or bags either, so we both held everything in our laps. They decorate the space to be very clean and homey so I hope they continue to update the seating/environment to reflect that!\n\nI understand that there are often little errors and miscommunications in customer service, but it felt like Miion was just continually making them due to systematic problems. I hope this feedback can allow them to improve, especially in such a high traffic and competitive location. I would love to come back to try more of their drinks, but only if I know I can receive what I ordered without so much confusion."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO_NQYKlN5Ok6PvPSnzy8VHoYhGt_ky3ynDhM8m\u0026fid=0x0:0x8ba9cd64a6ece30""],""When"":""2024-12-9""},{""Name"":""Nick Go"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWy1wVzdpckJ20S9UmFPOeDxIPDcWXe0ZStOYXqUqdan15D_SEi=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Richmond finally has a good independent coffee shop!\n\nMiion is super cute, the branding, interior design, furniture selection and overall vibe are \""chef's kiss\"".

Many reviews raved about their famous King Mango Chichi and Chichi Grape Smoothies and the Bobos. The Bobos has the extra agar they said but I don’t know what that is so I went with the Chichi Strawberry as the grape and mango is out of stock.\n\nAs someone health-conscious, I initially hesitated because the drink looked heavy in pictures. However, after watching how they prepared it behind the counter, I was impressed. They use fresh ingredients and load the drinks with real fruit, which immediately gave me confidence. Sure enough, the Chichi Strawberry was incredible—packed with a cup of fresh strawberries and topped with cheese foam. It was so good! It was like strawberry and cheese.\n\nWhat surprised me most was the jasmine-scented jelly sinker at the bottom. The drink wasn’t overly sweet, which I appreciated, and I liked it so much that I’m now curious to try more from Macu’s smoothie series—it’s absolutely worth it.\n\nAs for their milk tea, it was just average, similar to what you’d find elsewhere.

Their prices are also like a step back in time - maybe not 30 years back, but before food prices skyrocketed in the past few years. You can get a drink with toppings for $5-7 and the wheel cakes are a little over $1. Some of the toppings are a little expensive, but with the base price of the drink as affordable as it is, you can still get a premium topping and have a drink at a reasonable price. My drink, a green bean slush with taro paste, plus two wheel cakes was $9.75. Cash only.\nDespite the low prices, I was impressed by the quality of my drink. The earthy and natural flavour of the green bean paired with nutty taro was really nice. The taro paste was thick but smooth, and they were generous with it. Didn’t taste like \""cheap\"" bubble tea even if the price is not too high.\nThe wheel cakes were also so good! They have 10 flavours that they make, but only 4 were ready when I ordered. Luckily they had two that I wanted to try: radish and taro. They're constantly cooking the wheel cakes so mine were still nice and warm when I got them. The cakes were super soft inside and generously filled. The warm taro paste was almost custardy and the savoury radish filling was also tasty.\nThe woman who took my order was super nice!

I was initially excited to give this location a try, but what I ended up with was a letdown.\n\nThe barista was sloppy with my tealato as the toppings were all on one side, and it was bare on the other. There is one topping I always ordered at the now closed international village location, and I'm not sure if this location or chain switched suppliers, but it tasted very odd and it's not good way. As someone who worked in a similar job, I don't require minimum or near minimum wage baristas to be happy, bubbly, and enthusiastic, but I would like it if they made it look like there was some effort put in making the items at least to a passing standard. Even just drizzling a topping recklessly around the tealato is better than dumping it on one side near the edge of the cup.\n\nThe milk tea was either sitting for a while or poorly made as it tasted like a generic sweet drink that is arguably worse than the bottled milk tea that you can purchase in asian supermarkets. If milk tea could taste stale, that's probably how I would describe it. The international village location always had a nice taste of tea that's noticeable and tasted fresh. The quality here took a nosedive, at least it did during my visit.\n\nI like that this location is surrounded by great shops, which made visiting an enjoyable experience. I would visit the area again for the shopping, but not for this Shiny Tea location."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNK8c02hFxe8R_BSq4STFFb3yBbe-9rOaMiaysv\u0026fid=0x0:0x5281ea1f8d114369""],""When"":""2024-8-7""},{""Name"":""Emily Gan (甘可莹)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXENzagQ-F8-I2RvyQHjdfm9S2l0nEZGba2prkZP8YiyLRhUxQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The shop was easy to find.

Hazelbridge Way, Richmond, BC V6X2K7\n\nI chose to visit Well Tea during peak dinner hours to experience their offerings firsthand.\n\nAppetizers\n\nSquid Ball\n\nThe flavor of the squid ball was commendable, and the accompanying sauce complemented the dish well. While the exterior was slightly overcooked, the interior remained tender and flavorful. This minor flaw did not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nBeef Noodle Soup\n\nThe beef noodle soup featured a well-balanced flavor profile and a satisfying portion size. The beef was tender and well-prepared, contributing to a hearty and enjoyable dish.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nSatay Hotpot\n\nThe satay hotpot offered a pleasant flavor, though I found the proportion of vegetables to be somewhat excessive for my personal preference. Nevertheless, it was a well-executed dish.\n\nRating: 7 out of 10\n\nBeverages\n\nTaro Slush \u0026 Summer Girl\n\nThe taro slush was expertly prepared, with a smooth consistency free of any large ice chunks. The “Summer Girl” beverage, recommended by our waitress, was equally impressive and refreshing.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe restaurant provided a comfortable and inviting atmosphere, enhancing the dining experience.\n\nService\n\nThe service was exemplary. Our waitress demonstrated extensive knowledge of the menu and was both friendly and patient in explaining the various options. Her attentiveness was particularly notable, as she checked on our table multiple times to ensure our satisfaction. Such a level of service is rare in similar establishments and greatly contributed to the overall positive experience.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nPrice\n\nThe pricing is reasonable, offering good value given the quality and quantity of the food served.\n\nVerdict\n\nI will undoubtedly return to Well Tea. The diverse selection of Taiwanese cuisine, combined with affordable pricing and outstanding service, makes it a highly recommended dining destination."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOUjW9wxtfTFQ2QNQJsobqo9HFNTBGVmK2iD6o-\u0026fid=0x0:0xc588e04911339462""],""When"":""2024-8-13""},{""Name"":""Francis Wu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUachXJf0WTzrHMSnePZ9iHmUBp8eKFhZg_hqN3cQx4lsTYkO0=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Enjoy the Taiwanese BBT food at Well Tea.

Although the place has limited seating, we were able to reserve a table in the tatami section which I recommend as it's quieter and aesthetically pleasing. We got seated quite quickly and they started us off with the tea. We found the tea to be too sweet and couldn't make it less sweet no matter how much water we added. The tea was a blend of a black tea with Korean honey Yuja cha from T\u0026T. Tasty but too sweet. All the savoury and sweet items arrived all at once. They were beautifully presented although some of the sweet items were beginning to melt when we got to them. We had 3 people and the amount of food was more than enough. The savoury items were better than your typical high tea sandwiches. I think 1 more savoury item would've balanced out the menu more. Our favourites were the unagi inari for the savoury item and the yogurt/ice cream parfait with cornflakes and brown sugar pearls for the sweet items as the different textures made it a fun experience to eat. Didn't care for the mochi Dango on a stick as it was too chewy and flavorless. We couldn't finish it all so we ended up packing some of the sweets to go.

(The salesperson had troubles trying to explain what the blue stuff was. I guess, some kind of Asian ingredient that has no English equivalent?!) It wasn't bad but I liked my daughter's Cloudy Grape Slush better. I think I might even order the Cloudy Grape Slush for myself if we end up at this shop again!\n\nThere was a menu on the window displaying some cake and tiramisu desserts.

I requested 30% sugar and it was just right, unlike some other bubble tea places where the drinks often remain  too sweet even though I’ve asked for the same amount of sugar. If you like taro milk tea, make sure to try their fresh taro milk tea with their taro balls!

Cosmo Plaza, 8788 McKim Way #1205, Richmond, BC V6X 4E2\n\nDining at Garden City Hot Pot offers a straightforward and satisfying hot pot experience, with a selection of well-executed broths and fresh ingredients. For our dinner, we decided to explore two separate soup bases—parsley and preserved egg for my friend, and homemade satay for myself.\n\nFood\n\nHomemade Satay Soup\nThe homemade satay soup was a highlight of the meal, delivering a robust and flavorful base. The broth was rich without being overly salty, offering a good depth of flavor that worked well with the various meats and vegetables we added. Its seasoning was balanced, making it a versatile foundation for the hot pot experience.\nRating: 8/10\n\nFatty Beef Slices, Beef Tongue, Meatball Combo, Spinach, Chinese Mushrooms\nThe quality of the ingredients was consistently high. The fatty beef slices were tender and well-marbled, offering a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The beef tongue provided a nice textural contrast, and the meatball combo added variety to the protein selection.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nShandong Noodles\n\nThe Shandong noodles were a standout, thanks to their perfect texture. With a firm yet smooth bite, they held up well in the broth and added a satisfying element to the meal. They absorbed the rich flavors of the soup while maintaining their integrity, making them an excellent accompaniment.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nDeluxe Sashimi Platter\nUnfortunately, the deluxe sashimi platter was underwhelming. While the presentation was acceptable, the portion sizes and quality of the fish did not justify its name or price. The cuts were smaller than expected and lacked the freshness and vibrancy one would anticipate from a sashimi platter at a dedicated hot pot restaurant. It felt more akin to pre-packaged sushi than a premium offering.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nService\nThe service at Garden City Hot Pot was generally good, though not remarkable. The staff were courteous and attentive, ensuring that our hot pot experience proceeded smoothly. However, there was nothing particularly noteworthy about the service—while competent, it did not stand out as exceptional.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nAmbiance\nThe restaurant is clean, comfortable, and well-suited for a casual dining experience. The decor is simple, and the seating is comfortable, providing a relaxed atmosphere without the noise or bustle often associated with hot pot establishments. It’s a pleasant environment for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings, though it lacks any distinctive character that would make it memorable.\nRating: 8/10\n\nPrice\n\nPricing is reasonable for the quality and portion sizes offered. While some dishes, like the sashimi platter, feel overpriced for what they deliver, the majority of the menu offers good value, particularly the hot pot ingredients and broth selections.\n\nVerdict\n\nGarden City Hot Pot is a solid choice for hot pot enthusiasts seeking a reliable and enjoyable meal. The homemade satay soup and the quality of the ingredients make it a worthwhile visit. However, certain menu items, such as the sashimi platter, leave room for improvement. While it may not be a destination for those seeking a truly elevated dining experience, it delivers well on the essentials and is certainly worth a return visit to explore more of the menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMkwDrM4JqcVpTwAFZdHnfSYlR0PgcMoteGX7qW\u0026fid=0x0:0x3db777204510de14""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""Sinyo ganteng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVK6DhObLW3StVcJ_e9Ph42mdmAq5cSoW-d536hao-jSu7WAn8I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Food is okay, order hotpot and few dimsum. hotpot soup order sukoyaki mushroom, very tasty, meat was bit hard.  siomay is so tasteless. deepfried taro with scallops is very good.

We were intrigued because you don't normally find dim sum at a hot pot place.\n\nFirst of all, the complex this place is in seems a bit sketch (or at least it's seen better days). Once you get inside the restaurant tho' it's not bad. You order from a tablet and you can get both dim sum and other items.\n\nWe started with the braised oyster hot pot. We don't find this at many restaurants any more. The oysters seemed to have a bit of a pan-fried fried texture to the coating and the oysters were accompanied with slices of liver.\n\nFor the dim sum items, they generally came out to about $9/$10 per dish. The deep fried taro and scallop dumplings had a creamy filling. The scallop itself wasn't great but the taro to filling ratio was spot on.\n\nThe shrimp spring rolls had a layer of seaweed on the inside of the wrapper and turned out crispy. The chiu chow dumplings had a thinnish wrapper encasing the pork/shrimp and peanut filling and turned out nicely.\n\nThe honeycomb tripe was fairly good although some pieces were slightly chewier. Meanwhile the steamed tofu skin wraps were quite large and saucy.\n\nOverall, pleasantly surprised at the dim sum options at this hot pot place and will have to come back to check out the rest of their dishes.\n\nUpdate: Returned in December for dim sum. They had a discount for cash payment (think it was 20%)\n\nUpdate: Late March 2024... finally came back to try out their hot pot menu. I like that you can either get a large hot pot or smaller individual pots. We wound up ordering the sukiyaki and pork bone broth.\n\nThey had a special where you can get a dish of grass carp slices for $0.01 if you post an insta story. I was surprised at how large the grass carp dish was. While some of the pieces had some fish skin on that was a bit chewy, it was otherwise a good dish.\n\nAlso got the veggie platter, fatty beef slices, meat ball combo, dumplings, and udon noodles.\n\nIt was a bit much for us to finish because the serving sizes are large. It would probably be better if you come with a larger party. We were quite full afterwards and had to take some home. Overall, good quality hot pot. Next time we plan to do one hot pot and add some dim sum dishes."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOjxkHGg54ddz4VqbiFq6tfDeQi-3kQKQixrMj2\u0026fid=0x0:0x3db777204510de14""],""When"":""2023-11-22""},{""Name"":""Yolanda D"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLFx_59UN-u-qBUQeZeAmjyb4s7zOtkGAvBUrf6f0OniiuKSQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The best seafoods porridge hot pot I've ever had!

What really makes the drink are the topping selections: our favourites being a mix of the boba (mini pearls) and pearls (normal sized pearls). There is no extra charge for mixing the boba and pearls! The pearls are always nicely done - chewy, smooth, perfect sweetness, and fresh.\n\nService: Staff are fast with making drinks and we never have to wait long.\n\nBonus: they accept reusable bubble tea cups!

Highly recommended both drinks.\n\nI would say it is okay for the customer service. Everything can be done by using the order machine and there is no lineup in the afternoon.

I like that they have more savoury items than sweet, but both are done well. The scones are a highlight and freshly baked. Favourite was the sablefish and salmon oshi. Desserts were not overly sweet, very uniquely made and all the flavours came together.\n\nCons are 1) teas are very lacking, don't order the Earl Grey Green tea, never had such bland tea before! even when l asked for a second bag, there was no flavour... but I appreciate that the server changed our tea after we requested a different one.\n2) Service and timing of the food coming out was the most disappointing. We were 1 of only 2 tables and it took almost 40mins...\n3) the kitchen is an open kitchen and noise from\nwhat theyre preparing in there can be quite loud and distracting. Also it didnt help that the other table that was close to us was an extremely loud group and really hampered the relaxing atmosphere.\n\n4)Server really needs more training, it’s like it was her first job. She is not attentive. I’ve never gone to an afternoon tea place and been given our tea without any cream/sugar or a tea spoon until we asked…. she also can't speak English well so\nshe had a hard time describing what we were served, 2 instances where she did not know what the particular dish included. I ended up asking her to speak Mandarin instead. Please train her to understand the menu better. It’s a $65 tea set per person so I really expect better than this, considering your price point is only $10 less than an afternoon tea at Five Sails.\n\nThe restaurant is behind Versante Hotel, and there is no free parking ($3 for 2hrs).

Parking is street parking around the corner, or paid parking in the parkade. The restaurant can be a little confusing to find because the only signage saying \""Yandoux\"" is a sidewalk sign that leads to a very dark nameless door on West Road. When you enter it's a dim lobby, and Yandoux is on the left.\n\nThe space is bright, nicely decorated, very clean and quiet. Afternoon tea reservations are allotted 2 hours of seating time, but it was more than enough for a leisurely stay. If you are booking for 5+ people, they will call you for a deposit that you make via e-transfer.\n\nThere's a sizeable list of teas to try. I ordered an Elderberry tea, and while you can order milk and sugar to go with your teas, my friends and I found the teas fragrant and sweet enough on its own without needing to milk/sugar as we usually do. Our server continuously came by to refill our pots with hot water and that was very appreciated.\n\nThe photos show food for 2 afternoon tea sets. Everything was really nicely prepared and tasted wonderful. The sablefish, and the prosciutto burrata were my favourites of the savouries. The desserts all tasted really good, and not too sweet. My only complaint was that I found the sable in the lemon tart to be overbaked and very dry.\n\nEach tea set is $65 excluding tax/tips, and while it's a little pricier than other afternoon teas i've experienced, the overall stay and food is worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNJwvQwGo7QQZ8eYri63cHMWy75Uyz-OAhhBJiO\u0026fid=0x0:0x8ab573618998f0b4""],""When"":""2024-8-18""},{""Name"":""Angela Q"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWb_531iDFVKCasGm6UvuKw9uZaENkT6KFE4j7gJIfH4GYfpwM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Absolutely Delightful!\nThe set was stunning, with a beautiful selection of desserts and savory bites.\n\nThe ambiance was cozy and elegant, and the staff were attentive and welcoming.\nA must-visit spot for dessert lovers or anyone looking to enjoy a relaxing and luxurious afternoon.

However, I am a bit dissatisfied with the customer experience in my last visit.\n\nI ordered a milk tea with 30% sugar and regular ice. Unfortunately by the time I looked at my receipt and I realized it did not say 30% sugar the drink had already been made. As I let the girl with the glasses and claw clip know she said “but it’s already made, so it is it okay?”. And then I kindly asked her to remake it because I was sure I asked for 30% (I always get my drinks 30% for health reasons) and she looked pretty annoyed and said with a straight face “but you said regular sugar and ice”. To which I kindly said “oh I did say 30% actually sorry”. But I’m grateful she asked the barista to remake it anyways.\n\nWhat happened was after I ordered, there was a lineup behind me so I wanted to quickly leave the counter after ordering. It’s definitely my fault for not double checking the screen and properly listening to the cashier repeat my order. But even if it was my mistake, I don’t think it warranted that kind of reaction from her. Remaking a regular milk tea takes less than 30 seconds and doesn’t cost a lot of money at all. I didn’t understand why it seemed like such an inconvenience to request the drink to be remade. Again, I’m grateful she did end up asking the barista to remake my drink (she was also really nice when I was ordering) but this experience did make me a little sad and I felt bad for being troublesome."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

The female employee totally ignored us even though she saw us waiting and the rest of the customers had left with their orders already. She ignored us and started washing lychees at the sink.When I called her to ask where my daughter's order was, she asked for the order # and I politely told her that it was #120. She seemed to be preparing the order so I decided to give her some time. By now there was a big lineup of people waiting for their orders. She left our drink in the machine that seals the drink and started preparing drinks for other customers. After waiting for about 7 minutes, I called her again, and her question once again was what's your order #\"" I told her the order # again. She did not make an effort to leave what she was doing and look for the drink. The male employee heard me and went to the sealing machine, and handed us the drink. This behavior of the female employee was unacceptable. Either she was a racist, as I noticed all the customers were Asians or she doesn't have common courtesy. I would not recommend this place to any of my friends or relatives for sure. To be honest, I have never experienced this bad of a customer service before. Totally unacceptable.

Drawn by its inviting ambiance, we decided to step in and explore what this skewer-centric establishment had to offer.\n\nUpon entering, we were greeted warmly by the waitress, who quickly set a welcoming tone. Despite not being entirely familiar with the setup, she kindly and thoroughly explained how the dining process worked, guiding us through the skewer selection and offering recommendations.\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe restaurant’s interior reflects a casual, sports-themed atmosphere. Small tables and simple chairs provide a functional setting, while numerous TVs—including a large screen—play various sporting events. The sports-centric decor suggests that the owner is an avid fan, and while the setup may not be overly sophisticated, it creates a relaxed environment well-suited to groups and casual outings.\n\nFood\n\nLu Charcoal’s primary offering is its wide variety of skewers. Diners are invited to peruse the BBQ display table and hand-pick their desired skewers, which are then grilled to order. We sampled a variety of skewers, each prepared with care:\n\n•\tLamb skewer: 7/10\n•\tBeef tongue: 7/10\n•\tChicken gizzards: 7/10\n•\tPork intestines: 7/10\n•\tSpicy beef skewer: 8/10\n•\tPork belly: 7/10\n•\tFish skewer: 7/10\n•\tBeef skewer: 8/10\n\nThe skewers, while on the smaller side, were well-seasoned and offered a satisfying blend of textures and flavors. Notably, the spicy beef and regular beef skewers stood out for their depth of flavor, and are highly recommended. Do keep in mind that a minimum of two skewers per order is required.\n\nIn addition to the skewers, we sampled some items from the main menu:\n\n•\tSquid Teppanyaki: 8/10\nThe squid was cooked to perfection, with a savory teppanyaki sauce that complemented its natural flavors.\n•\tTofu Clay Pot with Rice: 7/10\nServed sizzling hot, this dish offered a hearty and comforting flavor profile, though it could benefit from a bit more complexity in seasoning.\n\nService\n\nService at Lu Charcoal was prompt and attentive. The staff ensured that our orders were handled efficiently, and the waitress provided helpful explanations throughout our visit, which enhanced the overall dining experience.\n\nRating : 8 out 10\n\nPricing\n\nPricing at Lu Charcoal is reasonable, with the portion sizes justifying the cost. Given the quality of the food and the variety on offer, it’s a good value for those seeking an enjoyable, low-key meal.\n\nVerdict\n\nLu Charcoal is a solid choice for those looking to indulge in flavorful skewers in a relaxed setting. The variety of skewer options, combined with the friendly service and reasonable pricing, makes it worth revisiting. We look forward to returning to try more of their offerings.\n\nTips for Dining\n\nParking is limited in the area, and it can get quite busy during dinner hours. Making a reservation is recommended to ensure a smooth dining experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMY6_q3NGSgsTVzdh2o2eQqzN0GntP3-Z0v_QEy\u0026fid=0x0:0x18a4ba66dfd32b4a""],""When"":""2024-10-9""},{""Name"":""Megan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocICR0jGe0k5gDisGrsljCpTwrEFG4uY-dATldnb1oklvcbtqVSd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I love to come here for breakfast.

We kept on waiting for my name to be called but nobody did which made me decide to come to the mobile pick up. There I found my order , coffee getting cold and no one bothered asking me even if I was already standing by the Mobile Pick up. I will be forgiving if it was crazy busy but it wasn't and staff were just chit chatting. Today, went straight to mobile pick up because I'm not sure if the staff will call me. Waited patiently and saw my order being prepared. (The counter order which i think I was about 5min ahead since I placed my mobile order was served ahead of me) I was standing there waiting for the staff up call or ask me but my order was just placed down and was left beside the machine. So I need to ask if that order is for me which was definitely mine. Had I not asked even if I'm standing there for the next 30min or an hour nobody will bother asking if I'm waiting for my order etc. So different with RC which I think is way busier that this location.

The good news was that during my stay, everybody was respectful and quiet. The other issue was with the location of the hotel. The hotel entrance is situated on alleyway, and the businesses surrounding this hotel have placed their large garbage bins in the alley, which does create quite a smell during the heat of the day, as you leave and enter the hotel.\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to experience a pod hotel and save money while creating less of a carbon flip print."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Harley Shanks"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU3yuM-hEEIFUQHj0zIAEyDtTuhtIXJopYc94PFEB0I1Rb5f1sT=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This pod hotel was fantastic.

The whole facility was very clean, from the common areas to the bathrooms to the pods themselves. The linens in the pod smelled freshly cleaned. The mattress in the pod was on the thinner side, sure, but I didn’t find it was uncomfortable. However, if you’re used to an extremely soft bed, you might find it uncomfortable.\nOverall, Panda Pod Hotel not only met my expectations but exceeded them. It was perfect for my needs: I really just needed a place to sleep for a few hours between a later evening flight and an early morning bus. I wish I could’ve stayed a little longer just to use the facilities more.\nShout out to the front desk guy who was there that showed great customer service.

19th, 2024]\n\n- we accidentally stumbled into their Burnaby branch at Crystal Mall one day and ordered a delicious $17.49 \""Yang's Braised Beef Brisket Hand-Pulled Noodles\"" (quite a mouthful). It was amazing. We loved it so much that each time we returned to our home base Richmond branch, we always ordered the same selection over and over again.\n\n- It has lots of beef brisket and, quite surprisingly, stewed just perfectly. It was always tender that required minimal chewing.\n\n- the noodle version costs $1.50 more than the rice version - handmade noodles, they say. Apart from that, both are the same.\n\nHighly recommended!!\n\n.\n\n[Dated: April, 2024]\n\nIt was fairly cheap. Food was delicious. Services were exemplary.

I ordered the fully loaded cilantro chicken wrap. I have ordered this many times before at this location and other locations. The cost was $7.79 + tax = $8.18 as you can see in my screen shot from my debit transaction.  I was on my lunch break. I stood on the side waiting to pick up my order like other customers. My wrap was ready and I grabbed it, even said thank you and  off I went to my car. As I sat in my car I opened the wrap to take my first bite like I always do. Then I realize today's wrap is totally off size!! But I was on my break and was in a rush back to work (cause to have to clock back in) so I didn't bother going back inside with a long line (lunch rush) I took my first bite and had to take another picture of my wrap. I kept shaking my head saying, \""there is NO WAY this wrap I ordered should be under 4\""!\"" Then I took few more bites and my wrap was finished. I got back to work and told my manager and colleagues. Everyone said why didn't I go complain. Told them I'm on my break on the clock. So my manager approved me to go back and complain. Shortly after I went back. Waited patiently for a staff to greet me and i nicely and calmly asked to speak to their manager. I greeted the manager and she greeted me. I asked her what is the size of your cilantro chicken wrap. Tim Hortons manager replied, \""our wrap comes in at 10\"". When it's folded it becomes about 6\"". I said ok sounds fair and I understand. I then showed her my photo of the cilantro chicken wrap from earlier. As she was looking at the photo I asked her \""does this look like 6\"" ???\"" I then said it's like 4\"". She then said, \""sometimes our wrap comes in smaller size.\"" She never apologized. She never offered to remake a new wrap or refund. She then asked me,\"" how did it taste?\"" I'm shaking my head and said, \""taste the same like always but that's not the point here.\"" She then said, \""thank you for showing us this and I will let my staff know to wrap it better next time.\"" I'm standing there still shaking my head?!!!!! And just walked off. This manager obviously thought nothing was wrong. Didn't care to apologize or remake me a wrap. This is unacceptable!! $8.18 for 3.5 bites of this 10\"" wrap or 6\"" wrap. Here are some pictures from today compared to what Tim\nHortons advertised. You be the judge for yourself. She said it becomes 6\"". Ok fine I respect that.

On the lower level, you have all of your groceries like produce, seafood, meat, a few bakeries, jewelry stores, kind of like a mini Chinatown. Upstairs is the food court. I was hoping there would be more of a variety, but most of the stalls were just selling pre-cooked Chinese food - the ones where you can pick a variety of 3 or 4 dishes for a set price. None of them looked too appealing. We ended up picking some rice rolls and spicy intestines from two of the stalls.\n\nIf you're staying in Downtown Vancouver, this isn't close. So I would say it's not really worth going out of your way for (unless you have a car).\n\nTip - a lot of the stalls are cash only."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMCib6uiLCSXy2KnxWb_CY7brwooKDYmTfzBhGY\u0026fid=0x0:0x865d6e6fc9ea4f5f""],""When"":""2024-7-23""},{""Name"":""Jay C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJloNfeeRcOpx9qptklkDJcpi7A9Xac_yEGtO84jM7bmJ0Y3rE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Chinese fast food galore! Among other things.\n\nIf you've checked out the Richmond food scene you've most likely heard of the Richmond Public Market. I have not been to China, but from what I hear, being here is much like being in an authentic Chinese market with many vendors crammed into it. Along with that comes the street vendor, hole-in-wall vibe. But that is part of the charm and you are not coming here for the updated, modern ambiance which is not here.\n\nThe bottom floor is mainly vendors selling groceries, clothes, etc. But you are here for the 2nd story, where all the food is. Be sure to bring some cash and if you don't there is an ATM so you can pull out cash. Most places are cash only from what I could gather.\n\nI went with what I'll call the \""authentic Panda Express\"" for my meal. It was a 3 item combo with chow mein/white rice. You'll find more than 2x the entree options that you'll find at Panda. The lady who helped spoke enough English that I could understand her. I was trying to order orange chicken as one of the entrees but to my surprise, 3 options which all resembled orange chicken were all pork dishes. So I went with two of those along with a tofu/veggie choice. Also had to get one of the crabs that are on display in front of all the entrees luring you into purchase.\n\nOne of the pork entrees was really good \u0026 fresh while the other seemed like it had been sitting for a while. The chow mein was quite bland but the food had so much flavor so it was not too bad. I believe the crab is coated in corn starch and then flash-fried. Went with the spicy option which is basically chili \u0026 garlic. It had good flavor but it would probably work better as some type of sauce. One win though was the excess garlic \u0026 chili tasted good with the chow mein \u0026 white rice.The 3 item combo was a large portion but since it was my only real meal for the day I finished it, but was very full.\n\nThere are many other options, such as rice rolls, wheel cakes and drinks. It's a pretty big place but still small enough to check it all out pretty quickly. There is a parking structure which is great, but it was very busy so be prepared for that. Also, there are a good amount of tables in the place, so once you grab your food, just find an available table.\n\nHave I had better food before? Yes. Was the food tasty and a good deal? Yes. Do I plan on coming back? Most likely yes.\n\nCheers!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMks4TxA6aEKeAtyfHxjjRcYK8MmWCwW7Y9KgdH\u0026fid=0x0:0x865d6e6fc9ea4f5f""],""When"":""2024-2-23""},{""Name"":""Pat H"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLG-dNH_dxDe8COit03Fl-sr5emXwBhh0GmEAMKf9ggoHF2Jw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I was surprised by the size of this market.

However, if you're expecting a bit more from your stay, prepare to be disappointed. I've stayed here more times than I’d care to admit, mainly because it's the designated spot for our sports team. But after two years, I've learned my lesson: next time, we're booking elsewhere.||My optimism for improvement this year was, at best, cautiously optimistic. Spoiler alert: things have not improved. The shower heads in every room (and I’ve been in many) still leak like they’ve seen better days, and that’s assuming you even get hot water. In fact, we've had to switch rooms twice in one evening just to get a bed that we didn’t crawl into after midnight. The first room had no hot water and a shower head that looked like it belonged in a bargain bin, and the second? Well, it had hair on the bed, grime in the shower, and stains on the sheets. Not exactly the luxury experience you'd hope for after a long day of travel.||Now, let's talk about the front desk staff. To say they’re “not exactly customer service oriented” would be an understatement. They’re defensive, impatient, and seem to be stuck in a never-ending loop of \""Sorry, the manager isn't available,\"" which is probably their catchphrase at this point. Meanwhile, complaints are piling up faster than a leaking shower head. On check-in day, I witnessed a call with another guest on the courtyard side struggling with hot water. Thankfully, I had the foresight to book in the tower, which, although pricier, actually delivered some working hot water—assuming you can get it through the dollar-store shower head.||Ah, the Executive Hotel: where the check-in procedure is as perplexing as the state of the rooms. You haven't even set foot in the door, it's the day before your travel 'BING' you get a notification that your card has been charged for your stay at a hotel you haven't even arrived at.. but then you arrive at the front desk, tired and hopeful, only to be told that they also require you to pay - up front - the remainder of your stay plus a $150 damage deposit (I don't think the $150 is going to do much for these rooms kids). That’s right. Not only are they charging you in advance, but they’ve also managed to perfect the art of making you feel like you’re staying at a place so shady, even your wallet might hesitate.||One can only assume that this quirky prepayment tactic is their clever way of avoiding those pesky “no-shows”—you know, the type of guest who might flee once they’ve seen the state of the shower, or the bed with more hair than a wig shop. But really, it feels more like they’re preparing for the inevitable moment when the room’s plumbing fails, the bed feels like a slab of concrete, and the shower turns into an indoor water park—all at the same time.||It’s a bit like booking a dinner reservation at a restaurant and paying upfront for the meal before even looking at the menu, but with the added excitement of knowing your meal might arrive cold, undercooked, or covered in stains. A great way to avoid getting stiffed, but also an excellent way to ensure your guests will definitely not be coming back.||As someone with over 30 years of executive-level travel experience, I've stayed in budget motels across the globe that have been more modern and better maintained than this place. (Yes, Motel 6 in the USA—I see you.) The ownership really needs to step up their game. I’m not even talking about a major overhaul; I mean the basics. Fix those leaking shower heads, re-grout the tiles, re-caulk the tubs, and for the love of all that’s holy, level the refrigerators. It’s not rocket science.||And here’s a thought: maybe hire a night manager and a maintenance person who can actually fix things right now instead of offering endless apologies. A simple “I’m sorry, let me get this fixed” goes a lot further than a weak “I’m sorry, but…” when you're a weary traveler who just wants to take a hot shower and collapse into bed.||I am only giving 2 stars, because at least the ceiling didn't leak."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kathleen R"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QdCjMUwIiBikRhCLHgN_0vyGAo1GvT8DEukiKQb1ujC_eFsFjYrQ0OvLoSxPtqmCdgvFA=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""The room was clean as was the hotel.

I ordered Creme Brulee Milk Tea, Sweater of Winter and Grape Jasmine Tea.\n\nCreme Brulee: I was bringing these drinks home for my family so I didn't try this Creme Brulee drink until I got home. One thing I'll say for this drink is that I was impressed with how solid the big chunk of Creme Brulee sitting on top of the drink was. For reasons beyond my control, I didn't make it home for another 3 hours. By the time I got home, I was afraid the Creme Brulee might have completely dissolved into the drink. To my surprise, the Creme Brulee was still in tact!\n\nSweater of Winter: This drink had a big swirl of whipping cream on top with lots of crunchy little chocolate balls dispersed throughout the whipping cream. It came with a lid that had a sliding window on it. The little kid inside me fell in love with this lid. The mini chocolate balls were fun to crunch on as well!\n\nGrape Jasmine Tea: Grape flavoured Jasmine Tea with a couple slices of lime, white pearls and some kind of white jelly at the bottom. The Grape flavor was delicious and I enjoyed the texture of the white pearls and jelly.\n\nMy daughter wants me to bring her to Momono Tea Shop so she can try the drinks right away next time.

If you love matcha, you will love this place. Their soft serve is delicious, although my favourite item is the Maiko special as it's a decadent treat with lots of ingredients inside and soft serve on top. They occasionally change up soft serve flavours as well, so I've loved the hojicha, ube, and yuzu flavours in addition to the usual matcha.\n\nService is pretty quick and smooth. The atmosphere is lovely as well, very warm. My only issue is that there's hardly any tables/seating inside, so if it's full you have to wait or go outside. In the summer/warmer months it's a great option to visit the playground/park outside the Richmond public market, but not so in the colder months.\n\nShoutout as well to Bryan who helped me figure out the new rewards system.

The 2 for 1 bubble is a great deal and for the most part, have been satisfied with their drinks.  Last Saturday, we did the 2 for 1 and asked for zero sugar.  The drinks  tasted watery and had little tea or milk flavor.   We took the drinks back and the employee that served us told us the drink is exactly the way it should be and the reason why it tasted  this way is because we asked for zero sugar.\nI feel the real reason the drink tasted this way is because they used too much water and made a weak tea.  She reluctantly  gave us two new ones,  but the problem is, the same weak tea was used and this time around, even less dairy was added.   At this point we just said, \""Whatever. Not worth haggling  over the 2 for 1.\""   Just by looking at the drinks and it's color, it's very obvious it was not up to it's usual standards.  And the fact that it was zero sugar does not explain why the tea flavor was so weak.  If there was sugar, it would of just tasted  like sugar water.  Mistakes happen and people have off days, but what bothers me is the worker's belligerent attitude in not accepting any responsibility to fact that the drinks she made may not have been up to their  usual standards and  adamantly insisting  we were  the ones that have a problem.\nWe'll go there again because of the fantastic  2 for 1,  and keep our fingers crossed  hoping we get our  usual drink."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOEJzWTgWGAkzSZPimbpgtI1EdZ-1kFew-_N-RQ\u0026fid=0x0:0xee63b21b6caa9bf1""],""When"":""2024-10-14""},{""Name"":""celia ungkana"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXWF3YX-oRLysTPL72fAkad3W3ufI7ieLSWLyw29lkrZSYjRn98=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""If I could give zero stars I would.\nOrdered two lemon tea from one of the food vendors who told me to pick up from this place just a few stalls over.\nThere was no one when I got there and spoke to the elderly lady and gave her the tickets from the food vendor lady.\nShe accepts them and from what I assumed , started to make my drinks.\nFew min later another lady came, maybe put in an order online but it took awhile\nThen her drinks finally come after standing for 15 min.\nI am still waiting for 2 lemon ice tea.\nThis lady doesn't communicate on wait time , won't make eye contact.\nAnd then proceed to take new customer orders.\nMy husband had to eventually step in and ask for the vouchers back so we could get refunded from the food vendor.\nAnd she had the audacity get mad at my husband.\nWe got our refund from the food vendor but after all this time waiting, our food had gone cold.\n\nMaybe we weren't chinese enough for her .\nI will never go and support that business ever."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOjGoTKuLxnFju6oLQgQ3hiT4QJ6rQH6ANzZNSa\u0026fid=0x0:0xee63b21b6caa9bf1""],""When"":""2024-4-13""},{""Name"":""Jason Chu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXo5sPZ67s_mnhJwZ79b2vBa8twlqYbk9eZujv14dBdLN9-xEyftw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Ordered a purple rice yoghurt drink.

While it does take a bit longer to prepare compared to standard instant milk teas (it takes at least 15 mins to make), the extra effort is definitely worth it.\n\nTheir other teas are equally great, I tried their HK Style lemon tea and their natural fruit tea, the balance of the tangy and sweet was just right.

I planned a trip to visit Vancouver last week traveling from California and chatted with someone from the Kong Tea website about ordering their products without a Canada physical address. They went above and beyond by arranging personal delivery even my order was about $100.\n\nThe delivery process felt very welcoming because the owner, 1st name initial (P) personally delivered the products to me with his family. They even did a little birthday surprise and their children drew a birthday card for me.\n\nThe owner also provided detail instructions on how to make the drinks. This is definitely the best customer service/white gloves service I ever received.  (While in Vancouver)\n\nOk. I finally have the chance to make the HK Milk Tea. Yes, it takes a little time but it's well worth it. I purchased the loose tea leaf and used a French pressed. The processed is simple by following the given instruction. This is by far the best HK style milk tea I ever had in Northern America. It reminds me of Hong Kong chaan teng.\n\nIn conclusion. 15mins is well worth the wait. This is no 3 in 1 instant. Plus, when you drink at the cha chaan teng. They have submerged the tea for a while. So, good quality takes time.

I have visited My Coffee numerous times now, primarily ordering the Mocha Frapp. The flavour is rich and tastes high quality. The consistency and how long the drink stays a frapp/slush/smoothie seems to be better and longer than other drink stores, including Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and the multitude of bubble tea stores. The prices are slightly cheaper than competitors as well.\n\nAnother menu item I have tried is the Green Tea Matcha Frapp. The taste reminds me of green tea-flavoured ice cream.\n\nAs of now, I have ordered from two different employees, but both are extremely friendly and efficient.

Korean-Western cuisine that’s a must try. We had the fried chicken waffles and Korean bugolgi eggs benny including their strawberry matcha cold latte beverage - all a must try! Decent pricing for the portions (approx. under $25 per our dishes). They have a camera Photo Booth where you can print your photo. They have maximized the seating space all the way to the door. Hopefully one day they will open a second location or a larger restaurant as this branch will get even more popular in no time. Will be returning and recommending to other locals!

While the seating was comfortable, the choice of background music and television programming seemed more tailored to local tastes, which may feel somewhat isolating for non-Chinese-speaking guests. This lack of inclusivity in the entertainment detracted from the overall dining atmosphere.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nFood:\n\nTom Yum Goong Seafood Hotpot with Rice\nThe Tom Yum Goong seafood hotpot was the highlight of the meal. The portion was generous, with a plentiful variety of seafood, including fish, shrimp, mussels, and fresh vegetables. The broth offered a well-balanced flavor, though it fell short of the punchy, spicy kick that typically defines this dish. A touch more heat would have elevated it to a more authentic Tom Yum experience. Nevertheless, the dish stands out as a solid choice for seafood lovers.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nFried Intestines\n\nThe fried intestines were an unexpected delight. Expertly fried to a crisp, they offered a satisfying texture and depth of flavor. Paired with a garlic soy dipping sauce, the dish was well-executed and is highly recommended for those seeking a unique starter.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nDrink:\n\nI opted for the taro slush, which unfortunately did not meet expectations. While the flavor was adequate, the texture was inconsistent, with ice chunks present throughout, marring the smoothness that a quality slush should provide. The drink could benefit from better preparation to achieve the expected level of refinement.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nService:\n\nThe service was the most significant area in need of improvement. Given the nature of the restaurant, my expectations were moderate, but the staff’s attentiveness was lacking. Additionally, communication was difficult for non-Chinese-speaking customers, which could be an obstacle for many diners. Greater attention to service and accommodating all guests would significantly enhance the overall experience.\n\nRating: 2/10\n\nPrice:\n\nThe pricing was fair, especially considering the portion sizes and quality of the dishes. It offers good value for those looking to enjoy a variety of flavorful options without overspending.\n\nVerdict:\n\nSuper Stars Cafe has potential, particularly with its food offerings, which are well-executed and reasonably priced. However, the experience was somewhat marred by the ambiance and service, which both require attention to cater to a broader clientele. The restaurant only accepts cash, and parking can be a challenge during peak hours, so plan accordingly. Despite these drawbacks, I would return to explore other items on their menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMCqMo_AmYOxKlMXPUQgJXonjcJO1zs0L_2Rqui\u0026fid=0x0:0x849f064f95af4389""],""When"":""2024-9-18""},{""Name"":""JENN WOO"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXvIJPgN4NR4GqFDWwcS6beS_JkwzhP97OBJCKBMgCo_hhFdb4d=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""One star is also dont want to give to this restaurant.\nService is so bad, also food is worst ever i had in Vancouver.\nAlso they only take cash(i dont know why permitted restaurant only get cash), and we didnt know they only get cash so we try to etransfer but they treated us like very annoying.

We chose our tea, and the savoury and sweet treats were served on Royal Albert Lavender Rose china. As always with afternoon tea, small portions but a nice variety of bites. My favourites were the Avocado Prawn Salad (served in the avocado shell) and the Panna Cotta. We knew the gelato was coming, so couldn't finish all the treats and took a small box to go.

Because we ordered the elegant tea set, we were able to modify one of the sets to be fit for a Vegetarian which was good.\n\nWe were lucky and got the backroom to ourselves. Decor was very nice and fit the atmosphere.\n\nThe savory portion was definitely better than the sweet. The bread for the cucumber sandwich did feel a bit dry and the \""bruschetta\"" was on regular bread toasted until it was very hard...not great. The scone was also a bit dry. Flavour wise though it was quite tasty and light. As a vegetarian, I am often given a completely different menu from others and it tends to be less inferior. At Gold's they mimic the \""regular\"" menu wonderfully. I consider this a bonus!\nFor example, instead of smoked salmon they gave me smoked carrot and they mimicked a tuna sandwich with a meat alternative. It still tasted very good. Visually it also looked similar.\n\nAs for the dessert portion I personally didn't feel it was anything amazing. It was very sweet and some of the desserts felt old. They do offer a cup of gelato at the end and it was very tasty. My personal favourite of the sweets.\n\nOverall the food was acceptable.\n\nMy biggest complaint and reason for a deducted star is the tea. Selection was fine, they offered green, black, and floral/fruit options. But the quality and strength was severely lacking.\nThe black teas came in a teabag which wouldn't be strong enough for a full pot (nevermind refills) and we felt the tea to be very weak  from the get go. As we got refills this only got worse and it tasted like water...\nThe fruit teas were loose leaf and were a bit stronger, just took longer steep time to get the full flavour. Either they need to use two tea bags/more tea leaves at the start, or offer a new teabag/change the leaves with refills."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO-2PJlybeW3XlZVzEnR7XlP6FQ7mL3DPBWdgwc\u0026fid=0x0:0x73d7e413212040a9""],""When"":""2023-8-8""},{""Name"":""w ww"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUv2peG2w5c_6CRckn7hOXsLLMMK4liTItSAavAbEq-jfzmSKZWgg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""afternoon tea as a treat with my friend!\n\nsurprisingly filling! both of us walked away SO Stuffed!! i did enjoy the variety of the foods and most things were quite delicious! i think we had an issue with one of the macarons though!\n\noverall nice experience and definitely good as a treat on a nice summer day!\n\ntheir gelato is delicious as well!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN4bOL3kN3B7SKOHl1wWy-00Bedo1K4_mVGk9Zy\u0026fid=0x0:0x73d7e413212040a9""],""When"":""2024-6-3""},{""Name"":""David Nagel-Nunez"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW4GrBw1C-wp5E6lU26l8zbTL7J98fUFUp_V_miqIS2FattutvC=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This place was so cute!!

Next there is a freezer with many packaged meats and sausages. A while back I got some black pudding to make a 'Full English' breakfast. Then there are a lot of spreads and sauces (my favourite is the Heinz Salad Cream). A small fridge has sweet pies and those wonderful currant squares. Sweet and sour with a crispy crust topped with sugar. The display case was pretty bare as it was the end of the day but call ahead to make sure they have what you want. The display of Cadbury chocolate is big. The fridge with drinks also has some surprises. They usually have a small area with discounted items. All through the middle of the store are various cookies/candy/chocolate.\nI bought Wilkin and Sons Ltd Marmalade. You can see in the pics the pieces of peel. It was so good and reminded me of when I was in the UK as the packaging is so iconic. I also bought Cawston Press Ginger Beer made with apple cider and ginger. It was really tasty with a chili kick! They also have Schweppes Bitter Lemon which is hard to find. Great on it's own or in cocktails.

It was not too busy on a weekday afternoon.\n\nI ordered a custom soy pudding. You can choose 1-4 toppings from a good list. I picked grass jelly, taro yam balls, and sago (they were out of salted cream). I had my choice of pudding base, so I chose ginger brown sugar syrup. It was $12.50.\n\nI sat down and waited for my order. It did take a little while, maybe between 5-10 minutes, but that was fine with me as it usually means the food will be fresh.\n\nPresentation - really gorgeous, delicate and appealing. There were two scoops of brown sugar shaved ice (?) on top.\n\nFlavor - The ginger is quite strong, and the syrup is very sweet and refreshing to contrast the unsweetened creamy soy. Really nice. The sago was super sweet, and the taro and yam offered a good nutty contrast that was fun to chew. The grass jelly was silky, flavored predominantly by just the syrup. I was worried that the flavors would be too strong, or bizarre, or would confuse my brain (again very new to the concept) but it was actually soooo good.\n\nTexture - I loved slurping the cool syrup with scoops of all the toppings. The soy itself is separated into very smooth, silky strips. I liked the gummy texture of the sago the most, it had an easy chew. The taro yam balls were soft but not too soft, chewy but not overly annoying.\n\nServing - Very very filling. Took me a long time to eat it. I was so satisfied afterwards.\n\nOverall - I really liked it, and I am craving more.

I've tried them all.  The place is huge for one thing, plenty of seats.  I never had a problem finding one whether I'm by myself or with other people.  I always order my black coffee, its always fresh and balanced.  I frequently order some of the breakfast sandwiches, but my favorite is the breakfast bagel that has melted cheese together with bacon and egg and the chipotle sauce completes the flavour.  I've had the curry wrap as well.  I've always wanted to try the cheesecakes because they look appetizing but maybe next time.   I like that there are tons of choices from dessert to sandwiches.  I know that they are also fresh, not sitting in the food display for weeks. It becomes hard after a while.  Although the place is busy I've never seen a long line and I have always gotten my drink relatively quick.  The staff is friendly whenever I come.  This is my pet peeve whenever doing reviews.  I dedicate a star just for that purpose coming from the service industry myself. The ambient music is just right, unlike the Starbucks across the street blasting music you can’t have a conversation and there’s plenty of light coming in thru the huge glass windows.  Not to mention the best views overlooking the river.  I've had great conversations with regulars here.  On a nice weather like this I enjoy sitting outside soaking the sun.

The miso caramel was tasty you can definitely taste the milky base, but I felt like it was lacking on the promise of miso; it's incredibly subtle so I only tasted the caramel majority of the time. It'd be a big plus if they could add more miso to the recipe next time as I felt it was missing that salty, umami kick.\n\nThe texture of the gelato was really nice and soft. The waffle cone is thinner than other waffle cones people may be used to, but i actually prefer it more wafer-y like how they did it here, and it had a really nice cinnamon flavour too.\n\nWould definitely come back and try the other unique flavours that they have here.

A hard one to nail, but also gives me a chance to try the base without too many mixins.\n\nI was honestly very surprised. This is real gelato, and the flavour is unreal. Sooo milky and dense, it literally glides on your tongue as it melts. And the flavour is straight up Frosted Flakes. I’m a massive flavour snob (pastry chef of ~10yrs), and this hits it out of the park. The high price might seem off putting, but gelato is a lot less aerated than ice cream so there’s more packed in there. And you really taste the difference in small batch. I’m super excited to go back for other flavors, especially pistachio and London fog.\n\nI also tried a couple of cookies to test out the pastries, and they were great. Definitely baked on the same day, they were still chewy and crisp. 15 seconds in the microwave made them taste like fresh out of the oven. I’m usually a few bites and I’m good kinda guy, but I ate both cookies and the entire pint in one sitting if that’s worth anything 😂👏🏻"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Their croffle was great, warm and crunchy and the whipped cream they put on top did not taste like the fake canned whipped cream.\n\nTheir bingsoo was also good, but not the best I’ve had. The ice was a bit wet and seemed sweetest at the top then lost its flavour at the bottom. The fruit was not sweet (but I guess it wasn’t peak berry season) but they gave you a decent amount which was nice. It was also a bit on the pricey side for $20, I’ve been to similar places where you get more toppings or better product for around the same price or less. Service was also quite slow as it took at least 15 minutes for us to get our food.\n\nAll in all I really liked their croffle but I’d go elsewhere for my bingsoo fix!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNmAOJIxfFP6P32ZjF5IsNktR1_Dc6hkC_64Sd3\u0026fid=0x0:0x40fac413888f04d4""],""When"":""2024-5-11""}]",
