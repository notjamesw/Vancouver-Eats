Located within walking distance from the seabus, this lovely establishment went above and beyond to ensure my experience with them was top-notch.  My server Veronica was friendly and attentive, as well as the host/manager who took extra measures to ensure all my needs were met (my friends say Vadim goes above and beyond and deserves a shoutout too!).  I loved that the oysters were all meaty kuushis packed with fresh flavour.  Word of warning to those sensitive to spice: there is a little spicy kick to the cocktail sauce, so be careful when dipping your prawn cocktail!  Super tasty, though, to those who don't mind a flavourful kick to the palate.\n\nBread pudding I had to send back even though it was recommended as the best.  First time trying this dish as a dessert (closest thing Ive had before this was yorkshire pudding as an entree accomaniment) and I originally wanted the tiramisu, but the hostess mentioned either the chocolate cake/bread pudding stood out more for her personally.  While I loved the non-featured items of the plate like fresh fruit, salted caramel, and vanilla ice cream with the graham cracker crumb bottom, perhaps I'm simply not a fan of \""bread pudding\"" itself so the feature completely turned me off, and that's not the establishment's fault.  Reasons: weird consistency (half cooked/half doughy bread, kinda dry even with salted caramel drizzled on top, mine felt stale but i could be wrong since I have nothing to compare it to) with conflicting infused flavours.  This one had raisins/nuts, and the profile wasn't harmonious with everything going on the plate."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNXENBzpBtHj53YXiHsX0WJJIlYpAAxJQiMeOMf\u0026fid=0x0:0x46f34abd8e759908""],""When"":""2024-9-28""},{""Name"":""Chloe MacDonald-Chow"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV5zL1-YjQshAAOOXLHLzCgNRwSlewF18GbUfuF6yTdawXHi8nN=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""1 star… not best service overall, then server rolled their eyes when we selected a tip. Biggest disappointment was that we came from Burnaby just to have oysters special and they limited us to 6 per table saying they were low. (There were three of us.. can’t imagine a table with more people). And then when we asked if we could have more since it’s the only reason we came, they said no they only had six left, which sounded like a lie. No compassion.\n\nBesides this, delicious food, great aesthetic, great location, has paid parking below! But I wouldn’t go back.\n\nWhen I go to a restaurant, I go to have a good time not to feel unwelcome just because of feeling disappointment. If a customer feels disappointed, the servers should show empathy and say that they totally understand that we took a whole trip to get here and they’re very sorry that they don’t have any more oysters. Or something along those lines. At least that’s how I treated people when I served and hosted. Instead, I felt like we were in the wrong for being disappointed that we travelled so long just to come to a place that doesn’t have what we want even though it’s a huge part of their restaurant."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNC_vE8iTZ6mUysa0guReNv21aD-CnpcACPPMtu\u0026fid=0x0:0x46f34abd8e759908""],""When"":""2024-6-22""},{""Name"":""Bryce Bastiaanssen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkGTAJckOfugyPlMouHfeWGFBHilkVoxMyQNhFu3i8GXkTovk=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""One of the best fine dining establishments in North Vancouver, my waitress today was Emily she was brilliant,  service always comes with a smile!

We decided to try out the North Vancouver location of Jam Cafe.\n\nFrom what I know, other branches of this restaurant tend to be super busy with lineups out the door. Not the case with this one. We walked in and got a table very easily! (Weekends might be a different story) It's a very spacious restaurant with a fun vibe to it; while there was no lineup to get into the restaurant, it was still quite busy inside.\n\nFeatured here:\nLavender Latte\nMocha\nThe Fat Elvis Waffle\nBlueberry Hill Pancakes\nThe Gravy Coops\n\nThe Fat Elvis Waffle is supposed to have peanut butter drizzled on top but our daughter isn't a fan of peanut butter. Instead, the restaurant drizzled condensed milk on top. This was at my request as I had searched the menu to see what other ingredients might possibly be used as a substitute for peanut butter. I was very happy that they were able to grant my request.\n\nMy jaw dropped when the Blueberry Hill Pancakes arrived. Blueberry Hill? More like Blueberry Mountain! It was a ginormous stack of pancakes!  I managed to get through half the stack. The leftovers lasted us two more breakfasts before they were gone! If you like Blueberry Pancakes I highly recommend the Blueberry Hill Pancakes. These pancakes were not only huge, but they were covered with a very generous portion of blueberries \u0026 blueberry sauce. There's a bit of lemon curd on it too, but not quite as much of it as the blueberries.

Some things were missed or wrong but they did give us a free dessert as an apology, which was nice. Overall the steak bulgogi was really well cooked and I would order it again.

They don't use salt but uses generous ingredients...\nThey tried best to please  customer. we felt comfortable and  relax ... atmosphere.  Anyway we all enjoyed happy moments while having lunch there.    We want to go back again...👍🏼👍🏼"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMcndPZMFSAzsoDzgmlozIXS905ks3tlfISqI4h\u0026fid=0x0:0x64c1a3ddeb0f39bb""],""When"":""2023-12-31""}]",

As with any Joey location we’ve visited before, it’s upscale casual done right. The atmosphere is perfect, with a colour palette, furnishings, music, and lighting that are all on point. As with other Joey restaurants in our experience, they’ve also done an excellent job of choosing great staff – both the hostesses and our server Harrison were excellent.\n\nThe food was quite good. We started with the Scallop \u0026 Prawn Ceviche, the presentation of which was excellent, and even for someone like me who hates cilantro, it was awfully yummy. I can’t say for sure if the tortilla chips were made fresh in the back, but they sure tasted like it. As far as starters go, this one is a 10.\n\nWe followed that by sharing the Chicken Parmesan – not something we’ve ever ordered, and perhaps not as enticing as some of their other offerings, but we simply wanted something different. Despite not being big pasta eaters, we still really enjoyed the dish. Chicken is often overcooked, but they nailed it, and it was juicy and delicious. Nothing fancy or notable here, just a very serviceable version of a classic dish. If this is a dish you’re familiar with, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nWe always consider the restroom when rating a restaurant, and for the most part Joey did a great job ensuring it was clean and classy. Our only complaint was the absurdly awkward hand dryers. We both walked out of the restroom at the same time, looked at each other, and our first comment was about how we had to use the dryers from the side instead of how they're meant to be used – from the front. A small thing they could consider fixing.\n\nOverall a wonderful place to enjoy date night, with excellent service, good food, and a great atmosphere for enjoying time and conversation with your favourite human."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP6SNv5V8UxuErHGPWC-EBdzfIbGVyVOultsVsi\u0026fid=0x0:0xaaf02f9bd527580d""],""When"":""2024-10-13""},{""Name"":""Tammy Chapman"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKrYxMsLPF2oQSLl1MBtNQrD5E2zyZGFxEhs87kRKIYjG64zg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Was having dinner with some friends. Our server was really nice and friendly but at times seemed scattered. We sat periodically with empty plates at the table. Two plates would be taken away while the other two remained at the table and the server carried on to other tables. Perhaps the server is new or had to many tables. I've worked in the industry for several years so I understand what it can be like. The one thing I really frown upon is when the server doesn't have their hair tied back especially if its long. Our server was constantly playing with their hair and then placing the guests cutlery in front of them on the table. From a health and safely standard this is a big no no. Quite frankly it's disgusting. I was shocked when our knives were placed on the table two were very dirty, also not to mention it felt like our coffee was dumped into the cups the person who poured the coffee took no care to wipe the cup down. The person who served it probably had no idea. Over all it will be awhile before I come back here.

I enjoyed the room's simple design, featuring tasteful wall art that reflects this North Vancouver neighbourhood. The menu is focused on sustainable seafood but includes a number of selections for diners who prefer food raised on land.\n\nThe young server was quick and attentive. My partner enjoyed Hokkaido Scallops with squash tortellini, sage butter sauce, and toasted walnuts. Scallops are easily overcooked but these shellfish well prepared. I had Sockeye Salmon Wellington and while the salmon was well cooked, the phyllo pastry was roasted beyond flaky. It was like a hard cracker. Overall though, the dinner was worthwhile.\n\nDessert was also mixed. Partner enjoyed crème caramel but the meringue in my Strawberry Pavlova was inedible. Undissolved sugar gave it the taste and mouthfeel of a sugar cube. When I indicated dissatisfaction, an alternative dessert was offered and the Pavlova was removed from our bill. The server and the manager responded to my remarks in a thoroughly professional manner. Flaws happen in restaurants but the strength of a dining room is determined by how well the staff responds.

We’ve ordered the chicken spaghettini, steak frites, prawn cocktail and the pier 7 oyster trio. I didn’t really raise my hopes up, but this time it was a really great experience. The checkbacks were consistent, food was great (steak frites could’ve been more softer). The dessert was also pretty good. As a restaurant manager myself, this service recovery’s pretty good and again, Keon did a very great job.\n\nI’m just hoping that for my next visit, the service won’t change and be able to keep it consistent.\n\nThank you Pier 7.

As vegetarians, we often find ourselves with limited options at most restaurants, but Carpe Grill \u0026 Diner truly exceeded our expectations. The veggie patty was perfectly seasoned, with just the right balance of texture and flavor. It was clear that a lot of thought had gone into making this dish not just an option for vegetarians but a standout menu item on its own. Paired with fresh toppings and a soft bun, every bite was delicious and satisfying.\n\nThe service was equally impressive. The staff were incredibly friendly, attentive, and genuinely seemed to care about ensuring we had a great experience. Nader, in particular, went above and beyond to make our visit special. He was not only professional and courteous but also had such a positive and welcoming attitude that it added to the overall enjoyment of our meal.\n\nIt’s rare to find a place where both the food and service are exceptional, but Carpe Grill \u0026 Diner nails it.

She gave me a call, listened to my experience, relayed what she had learned after speaking to staff, apologized sincerely for our experience, and invited my friends and I back for a chance to make things right.\n\nWe returned to Anatoli's last night and everything was 10/10. The service was outstanding the food was wonderful—a complete 180 from our previous dining experience. Our server Tim was very attentive, friendly, and ensured we all had a good time.\n\nWe tried multiple dishes with everything tasting superb! (I wish we had taken more photos but we started eating as soon as the food arrived!) Our highlights were definitely the watermelon salad and the grilled humboldt squid.\n\nI understand mistakes can happen at restaurants and I believe a big indicator on a business' professionalism is how they try to make things right with the customer.\n\nGeorgia and her team went above and beyond to give us a true taste of what dinner at Anatoli's is like.\n\nWe will definitely be coming back!\n\n***\nAfter reading so many positive reviews and having this restaurant strongly recommended by close friends, I was so surprised to have experienced such awful service. Off the top, I want to say our issue was not with our server (who was great!) but with the kitchen. Our group of five waited 45 minutes for our mains (no appetizers were ordered) and one of our guests received her meal 10 minutes after everyone else's. The big issue though was that all of our food (rice, meat, and potatoes) were cold. When I brought this to the server's attention, she apologized, spoke to the kitchen and then shockingly returned to tell me that \""they don't believe me.\"" She said the kitchen staff had said plates can get cold while people wait to eat, so the plate was probably cold but not the food. I was stunned at this response as I wasn't trying to send my food back, just have it warmed up. I had tasted everything on my plate before speaking to the waitress and even asked guests at our table to confirm it was cold. The server was noticeably embarrassed and offered to take my plate back to be warmed up. After about five minutes the plate returned and the meat and rice were the exact same cold temperature and the potatoes had, at best, increased from cold to mildly warm. At this point, we were well over an hour into our dinner, my friends had been eating for 15 minutes, so I told the server the food was still cold but that I didn't want to wait any longer. She apologized profusely, said she would speak to the manager and when she returned she said they had offered to give us each a dessert. I felt it would have been more professional if the manager had come over to speak to our table personally but I appreciated the gesture. And it was not just our table experiencing issues with the kitchen. A table of eight directly beside us made multiple complaints about how long their food was taking and then had their mains arrive 10-15 minutes apart. The restaurant is gorgeous and our server was very professional but when you're charging $30 for a main, making guests wait 45 minutes, serving cold food, and then having your chefs openly dispute your claim that the food is cold and argue with their own staff, it leaves customers with a tremendously negative experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMFxCU5hTp7-ao8szjvj-dDoaESq78t9vmriKgQ\u0026fid=0x0:0x8778d34e1ec9df96""],""When"":""2024-6-13""},{""Name"":""Romantic Spirit"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXCOCvFxjQApDCEXk-a-OPAkRV025OSNERq20H9bHjJEdlqY0el=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Loved my food, time and the fun belly dancer they had for entertainment.

visited Fryingpan Express for Hot Chicken, and unfortunately, the experience left much to be desired. The restaurant is an open space with minimal design, featuring extremely cheap decor and tables that don’t create a welcoming atmosphere. While it wasn’t dirty, it also wasn’t very clean, which added to the overall lackluster ambiance.\n\nFor the food, I ordered a mild hotness chicken burger with fries and a Coke. The presentation was very basic—fries were dumped in a basket with the burger on top, reminiscent of something you might get at a diner. The portion size was disappointing; the burger was quite small, and the fries were nothing special.\n\nThe chicken in the burger was thick and juicy, which was a plus, but the flavor left a lot to be desired. The “mild” hotness was overwhelming, and I’m someone who enjoys spicy food. It seemed like the heat was used to mask the blandness of the chicken. The burger itself was very basic—just the chicken and bread, with a tiny portion of coleslaw and a single slice of pickle drowned in condiments.\n\nEven the little things, like the ketchup packets and napkins, screamed cheap. The ketchup was in single-use packets like you’d find at a fast-food joint, and the napkins were the flimsy type you might see in a gas station restroom.\n\nOverall, Fryingpan Express for Hot Chicken seems to cut corners at every opportunity, which shows in both the service and food quality. I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re in a pinch and have no other options."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPrWnw_UQryGeGd16JMQ64crZ69r8IhOB4fEUxH\u0026fid=0x0:0x9cd2c350c480bbda""],""When"":""2024-8-16""},{""Name"":""Joaquin Surijon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXRl_0NnJWTKW0CwMobY87xpQkHv9cGa_klyETq6yYZG_js2HZ1=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I was with a friend and the manager let me stay late to finish my food because I did come a little late, he also let me stay to wait for my friends dad to pick us up.\n\nThe food also taste INCREDIBLY good and has the best fries in the world, I'm not even joking.\n\nThe atmosphere is also good because it's not messy, and it's comfortable.\n\nReally good and deserves the best reviews possible."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMYJ3wwMi9FMqZtFGF9ykiVxJrwGwjpZDFuP2lg\u0026fid=0x0:0x9cd2c350c480bbda""],""When"":""2024-11-23""},{""Name"":""Sharon Sa"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV-ZatOwc0o-_pcFCHW6F3-vZav6E45c9r8cCGUjqpf-G46H7p8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I sent my partner on a mission to get fried chicken as our late night snack and we were both pleasantly surprised with the quality and service.

It tasted like it came straight out of a dessert cafe instead of a chicken restaurant. The sides (potato and sweet potato fries) were salted to the extent where they weren't flavourless, but not too salty, right in the middle. They were very well done.\n\nThe burger had excellent portion (I am a heavy eater, and I was very pleased with how filling it was), and the chicken breast was tender and juicy. The burger was a perfect combination of chicken, relish, and the sauce also complimented the flavour well. I would recommend to order either the zero or mild spice level for others who don't necessarily handle spice well like myself. It didn't leave a greasy after taste at all, which is exactly what I seek in a chicken sandwich.\n\nMoreover, the chicken and waffles also offered great portion, and I was particularly impressed by the waffles. They were soft, and the vanilla cream was especially tasty and addicting, effectively balancing out the chicken flavour to go well hand in hand.\n\nIn addition, the staff were friendly, enthusiastic, while the interior offered a clean, spacious, and cozy atmosphere that accompanied the dining experience competently.

Their sautéed mushrooms are packed with umami flavour. It also comes with a good amount of edamame! At the end, we could also add pickled onions, fried onions, and sesame seeds as toppings (highly recommend their pickled onions). For one of the bowls, we were able to substitute the spinach and kale for some quinoa, so did appreciate the customization! If we had one minor issue, it would be to ask for more sauce. The creamy sesame dressing could have been more plentiful to cover the various ingredients.\n\nThe Vanilla Matcha smoothie was alright. I was able to substitute the whey for vegan whey/protein, but it was definitely a prominent banana flavour when I was hoping for a stronger matcha one! It was very creamy.

Old school Bavarian style. There was also live performances inside that attracted our attention.\nStepping inside of the restaurant, the servers welcomed us very warmly. We went without a reservation at 5:00pm and at that time you didn’t need a reservation but you typically would on a Friday night so remember to book one.\nNow, onto the food. The food was amazing. We ordered a beer (Czech Dark Beer) and it went really well with the meats. We were sharing so we wanted to order a bit of everything. Out of the sausage platter, the venison sausage is a must-try. The Bratwurst also tastes very authentic and went very well with the beer. The Schnitzel was alright, but the mushroom sauce elevated it to a 10/10 immediately- the sauce is a must try. The Ham was a bit salty but paired well with the Sauerkraut and the beer. The third dish was the Schweinshaxe, but it kind of disappointed . The portion is of average/smaller size, and skin was not as crispy as we’d like it to be. However, the meat was very juicy and paired amazingly well with the sauce and Sauerkraut. Perhaps it was because we were in a rush and we kind of rushed the kitchen (the Schweinshaxe would usually take 20 minutes. Ours was in 15 ish). It still tasted great nevertheless.\nIf you come here next time, definitely try the mushroom sauce (Jager?) and the schnitzel. Also get the dark beer with the meat (per server recommendation) and the venison sausage. If you have enough time , try the Schweinshaxe."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNcA22JgLyKa7Dd1Gs6TfoxRkPWaqjphSqaK63R\u0026fid=0x0:0x653aba0057cf290a""],""When"":""2024-8-3""},{""Name"":""Aila Sin"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL8MgZXJGh2Udq48mzaMNH8FqwzoLdEJITvzQVTvQsse2QChQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I'm flabbergasted that this place is currently averaging '4.7' stars as the average rating.

My parter and I were deceived by the rating and decided to give this place a shot.\n\nThis has to be, hands down, the most sorry excuse for food in general (forget German food) I have ever seen or eaten in my life.\n\nThe soup of the day was a stodgy, sour, gluey mess that looked like something you'd get served if you were a prisoner of war. The \""stone ground freshly made bread basket\"" was a couple of dry pieces of brown toast that looked it was from No Frills.\n\nThe Swiss rosti was DRENCHED in oil. I'm not being hyperbolic, but there was oil oozing out of the pancake when I pressed into it with my fork, and a thick layer of oil swimming on the plate when I lifted the rosti to look underneath. The lettuce on top of the rosti was wilted, grey, wet, and cold. My partner ordered Schnitzel - it tasted like frozen food, extremely bland with cold sides.\n\nService was mediocre, aside from bringing us our plates of food from the kitchen with a smile, there wasn't much else by way of \""hospitality\"". The tablecloth and glasses were visibly stained and dirty. The ambiance was kitschy, gloomy, and stuffy.\n\n99.9% of the clientele here on the night we visited were MUCH older folk. I'm not sure if that's the reason for the high rating - really old people with barely any teeth left or working tastebuds probably love the stodgy and bland bits fried glue the restaurant is marketing as \""German food\"".\n\nNot surprised this place is open only 4 days of the week from 5- 9PM/10 PM.

The service is top-notch and I would definitely like to give a call out to our server Morris, he was excellent and definitely added to the experience of the evening. The food was really good, lovely presentation, excellent flavours and cooked to perfection. My husband had the lamb and I had veal and they were both excellent. Just a heads up the lamb is spicy, which was unexpected and would’ve wrecked my dinner, but my husband said it was excellent. My husband had the testarossa cocktail and it was fun, definitely worth ordering for the presentation. It was a very busy night so we ended up being sat out on the patio, which we were hesitant about at first. It is very comfortable on the patio, warm and heated, our seat had a peekaboo of the ocean. You do need to be OK with people walking by but we enjoy watching people so that worked out fine. I have read some comments where people said it had an Italian “feel”. We personally don’t agree with this, the inside of the restaurant is very cold and does not have an old Italian restaurant feel at all. It is the total opposite decor of the restaurant that was there before which definitely captured the old Italian feel.  It’s very modern so we were happy to be put outside.

They pushed the smaller tables together by the bench against the wall and it was hard to get in and out, especially with a baby car seat.\n\nThe food was delicious with a large variety of Malaysian dishes.  We were glad to see that there were spicy and non spicy dishes, some more flavourful than others.  We ordered all kinds of meat and veggie dishes like laksa, satay, coconut rice, fish etc etc. The food was fresh and hot and everyone enjoyed eating.

I reckon the server really doesn't want to be there, he was so lacking in interest or enthusiasm.  The food, however, was better than ever.  Two of us shared the green papaya and mango salad to start followed by Hainanese chicken, mee goreng and eggplant in spicy chili garlic.  All served piping hot and in generous portions.  The food definitely is worth returning for despite the service issue.\n\nBeen to Tamarind Hill several times but haven't visited in quite awhile so decided to have lunch there the other day.  Three of us shared a mango and green papaya salad, calamari, Hainanese chicken and nasi goreng.  The salad was very enjoyable - just a little bit spicy in a good way. The calamari was pretty good, though the portion size was on the small side. Hainanese chicken was very moist and tasty, would order again. The nasi goreng was meh, not a lot of flavour. Service was good and despite arriving under an hour before closing, we were not rushed out.

If you’re hungry, I wouldn’t recommend dining here because you’ll likely leave unsatisfied. The food itself was relatively good, but it felt like we were paying more for the fancy presentation than the actual meal. For example, we paid around $50 for what you see in the picture, and we were still hungry when we left. To make matters worse, the service was rushed and unwelcoming. The waitress kept pushing us to leave because the restaurant was closing at 10, which came across as very rude. I understand needing to close on time, but it could have been handled more politely. Overall, while the food tasted decent, the small portions, high prices, and unfriendly service make it hard to recommend this place. There are far better options out there for the same price."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOLY3lN7JeRzn-S4xkAv9QHPvrN_plVVW_yqpSB\u0026fid=0x0:0x6e2c938210a1abf""],""When"":""2023-9-29""},{""Name"":""Lyubka Krasteva"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVyK1DCK3Ze-EiSYqmbHpnqcl2kgY7-HDuLhP-wDVSJWQ3ysYkftA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I’m not sure if my experience is because I went to pick up only an hour before they closed.

The staff are lovely always very friendly and kind and always do their best to make sure I leave a very happy and no longer hungry customer. Their chicken shawarma wrap with all the fixings is my all time favourite. Always tastes fresh, chicken is rich with flavour and just a little crispy on the edges and the sauces just tie it all together, and for an added special bonus if you’re extra hungry I recommend adding the fried halloumi to the wrap for the extra cheesy richness. Also highly recommend the fruit drinks mango is my favourite. I’d recommend this place to anyone it’s just that good.

During our visit, we experienced a variety of items, each showcasing different aspects of the restaurant’s culinary approach. While the meal had its highlights, some dishes left room for improvement.\n\nService:\nUpon arrival, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated without delay. The service throughout the meal was attentive and friendly, with our waitress making sure we were well taken care of. This level of hospitality certainly enhanced the dining experience.\n\nRating : 8/10\n\nFoods:\n\n•\tTako Wasabi:\nThe Tako Wasabi featured seasoned octopus paired with a hint of wasabi. The balance between the savory flavors of the octopus and the sharp kick of wasabi was well-executed. However, the accompanying seaweed portion was somewhat sparse, limiting its potential as a balanced side element. Despite this minor shortcoming, the dish was enjoyable and satisfying.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tJL Poke Bowl (Brown Rice \u0026 Avocado):\n\nThe poke bowl, featuring brown rice and avocado, was underwhelming. While the ingredients were fresh, the portion was smaller than expected, and the overall flavor profile lacked the depth found in similar dishes at other establishments. There was nothing particularly memorable about the dish, and it didn’t stand out amidst the other offerings.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\n•\tLonsdale Crossing Roll:\nThis roll combined prawn and yam tempura with cream cheese and crab meat, topped with avocado and a special house sauce. The flavors were rich and well-balanced, with the creaminess of the avocado and crab working harmoniously with the crispy tempura. The special sauce added a delightful finishing touch, making this one of the more successful dishes of the evening.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tKatsu Don:\nThe Katsu Don, featuring deep-fried breaded pork and egg served over rice with Japanese soup stock, was another strong dish. The pork was perfectly fried, maintaining a crisp texture while remaining tender inside. The seasoning was well-balanced, and the dish as a whole was comforting and flavorful.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n•\tOyster Motoyaki:\nUnfortunately, the Oyster Motoyaki was the least enjoyable dish of the night. The dish was overly dominated by mayonnaise-based sauce, which masked the flavor of the oysters. Compared to similar offerings at other Japanese restaurants, this rendition was disappointing. The portion was served in a platter-style presentation, and the overall taste failed to impress.\n\nRating: 4/10\n\nAmbiance:\nThe ambiance of JL Sushi \u0026 Kitchen is functional but not particularly remarkable. While the space was clean and comfortable, there was nothing about the decor or atmosphere that stood out or elevated the dining experience. It’s a suitable spot for a casual meal, but it lacks the visual or experiential elements that might make it more memorable.\n\nPrice:\nThe prices were reasonable given the quality and quantity of food. While some dishes didn’t quite meet expectations, the pricing was in line with similar restaurants in the area, making it an affordable option for those seeking Japanese cuisine.\n\nVerdict:\nOverall, JL Sushi \u0026 Kitchen provides a decent dining experience, with a few standout dishes alongside some that could use improvement. The service was a definite highlight, and the reasonable pricing makes it a viable option for those in the area. While there were some disappointments, particularly with the Oyster Motoyaki, I would consider returning to explore more of the menu, especially given the quality of the Katsu Don and Lonsdale Crossing Roll."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP5Oh7RTFBdyeUWPm-wxLwQippuMA9bLnbi7hVu\u0026fid=0x0:0x54af63e105f36f8a""],""When"":""2024-9-17""},{""Name"":""Chloe Genargue"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWcB97SzXsMD6panoq_G9yq28plXwWkj0h7AznJw7Xc37ypMfg5=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""A few blocks away from where I work.

First, I was surprised to find that we had to pay for our order before eating, with an expectation for a tip without even tasting the food. There was nothing particularly special about the food or service to justify that approach.\n\nThe worst part was seeing a mouse in the dining area. When I informed the staff, the response was very casual; the server just mentioned she was scared. When my wife asked if the manager had been informed, the server said the manager was aware and \""sorry,\"" but there was no direct apology or acknowledgment from the manager.

With everyone in our group expressing curiosity about this place, we ultimately decided to give it a try. The establishment appeared to be well-maintained, and the service was friendly, albeit a bit slow. However, my friends were disappointed with their meals, finding them lacking in flavor and too plain. While my noodle dish was enjoyable, it didn't quite justify the high price considering the portion size. It felt like this Korean restaurant deviated from the traditional experience I usually seek. One aspect I particularly appreciate in Korean restaurants is the variety of side dishes, but here they only provided three small ones, and we had to repeatedly request more kimchi. Considering the overall cost, we concluded that the value for money was not satisfactory.

The waitstaff were very attentive and friendly, ensuring that we had everything we needed throughout our meal.\n\nOne of my favorite features of this place is the unlimited parmesan and garlic sauce they offer. It adds a fantastic touch to the pizza and allows you to customize each slice just the way you like it. Plus, they have a variety of other condiments available, which is a nice bonus.\n\nI also loved their selection of different pops from the USA and Italy. It’s great to have unique beverage options that you don’t find everywhere. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot for a casual meal with friends or family.\n\nOverall, Captain Oven Pizza never disappoints, and I can't wait to return for another round of their amazing pizza and excellent service!

Unfortunately, the newer branches don’t live up to the reputation of that first location, which was worth the drive just for a fully loaded pizza with lots of toppings.

Display case was almost empty (3 cookies and \u003c 15 items in fridge). Breakfast menu (benny / scramble eggs etc) also was not all available. Avocado toast and benny were not available and shop keeper doesn’t seem to know the menu well.\n- I don’t think that I visited during off hours which might contribute to this issue.. However, beyond the above, there were some many fruit flies everywhere when I sit down to eat which made the visit quite unpleasant.\n\nI was really looking forward to the visit as I think this place has a lot of potential but between the unpreparedness of staff and unclean environment I will not be returning any time soon for coffee/breakfast.\n\nNoted the place also has a small fridge with selection of convenience store like items (canned beverages, milk) which I imagine is convenient if you live in the neighborhood."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sanaz"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKTNtImUpOds22CA2SEG4A_S7XMKtajkKHWUk0YXw9U-soQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing local coffee shop with great coffee, sandwiches and sweets.

Prior it was a nice place to grab a rather affordable brunch. After the renovations (which look amazing) I was a bit annoyed by the service, which took over 5 minutes to even get acknowledged and seated with a mostly empty restaurant. Once seated I got friendly service, however the food left much to be desired. I ordered the chilaquiles (divorced to try both salsas) and I've never been so underwhelmed by a version of this dish. The salsa was cold and tasted like it was from a bottle. Chilaquiles are supposed to be served hot after stewing the tortillas briefly in the hot salsa, and that was what I was expecting. The refried beans likewise seemed like they were from a can and were bland. For the price I paid it was a disappointing meal. Perhaps it was an off day, but it is unlikely I will be back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPLpKu5EFEvFrjavJ72aXYuQgvIb21--o3RMY1i\u0026fid=0x0:0xec2dfa93a9300da8""],""When"":""2024-1-18""},{""Name"":""Penny Rusty Sophie"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkGfXMIDqwS_yD1axTk6tkHoLsnybE2ErvKrHMoMIElMJWekI_=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Cute little bistro nestled in a fairly residential area of North Vancouver.

They serve both pizza and pasta in their restaurant.\n\nWe'd been to Alberello Pizzeria once a few years ago and I remember being super impressed with the pizza there, so when the family decided to go there for dinner again, I knew I would be ordering pizza again.\n\nIn addition to pizza, I also tried some of the Rucola salad which another member of the family had ordered. The grapefruit in it definitely gave it a pop of colour, and while grapefruit isn't exactly my favourite fruit when it comes to taste, I did enjoy the juiciness of the fruit.\n\nI ordered the Grille Pizza which came with marinara sauce, mozzarella, roasted eggplant, roasted red pepper, zucchini, fresh parsley and chili oil. Pretty sure this was the same pizza I had ordered the first time we came to this restaurant.It was super tasty and they did a good job of roasting the vegetables on top. When I eat anything with eggplant on it, I always prefer my eggplant to be cooked until it has become very soft.\n\nMy daughter however ordered the exact same pizza as me, and for some reason the veggies were not as soft on her pizza; so while I very much enjoyed my food I think this restaurant needs to work a bit on consistency since my daughter's pizza wasn't quite as enjoyable as mine.\n\nService: Good\nParking: Free parking on the street\nLocation: 115 15th St., North Vancouver, BC"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNW55Jk43ZnmtT7Gi4igL_fAK_6ZvolshYvlLQz\u0026fid=0x0:0x5f22477537727e6d""],""When"":""2024-5-8""},{""Name"":""Guillaume Bourassa"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUv5-8qIsaut-K6utIhDeGMPbJTZOfr1s0gwe_bvTCBfNFlG4y9=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food was incredible.

As a fellow risk-taker in life's culinary adventures due to seafood allergies, I dared to venture into this quaint establishment, and I'm glad I did.\n\nFood Quality (5/5):\nEach bite of the Avocado roll, Cucumber Roll, and Veggie Roll was a testament to the chef's dedication to perfection. The rice, cooked to just the right consistency, cradled fresh, vibrant vegetables that were a delight to the palate. Not a hint of browning or toughness, a common pitfall in many rushed sushi joints.\n\nPrice-Value Ratio (4/5):\nWhile prices may tilt towards the higher end compared to nearby alternatives, the superior quality justifies every penny spent. When it comes to sushi, I firmly believe that quality should never be compromised for the sake of savings.\n\nAmbiance (4/5):\nSimplicity meets style in Sushi Kumo's ambiance. Though modest, the decor exudes a certain charm that complements the dining experience.\n\nService (3/5):\nUnfortunately, the otherwise stellar experience was marred by lackluster service. The pace was sluggish, with no check-ins to inquire about our needs. Water and tea remained unrefilled, a disappointing oversight that detracted from the overall enjoyment. It was disheartening to observe preferential treatment towards certain patrons, a stark contrast to the egalitarian spirit of hospitality.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nDespite the service hiccup, Sushi Kumo remains a gem worth revisiting. For vegetarian sushi aficionados seeking impeccable quality, this is the place to be. Just be prepared to exercise patience and perhaps a gentle reminder for a refill on your drink."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMAAFLXypofXwTmZtzW2-QOdbIKtO4UIx5EjtS8\u0026fid=0x0:0x4208792eed890708""],""When"":""2024-5-16""},{""Name"":""Kat Z"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUEo-i39N__rpJH69CgrWcJ6RTEhnTJfwjlxxJLH4yrE-w015XZoA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Taste is good but they skimp on takeout portions.

It was like a cross between Eggs Benny and a taco salad. We both had fresh orange juice to drink which was refreshing.\n\nMy mom enjoyed her Benny but was not able to finish the tasty potatoes so she took those home. I love eggs Benny so the Southwest Bowl was a fresh take on it. It had the poached eggs and potatoes like the Benny but the corn, black beans, avocado salsa, feta and mole gave it a completely different flavour which I loved!

Super!!!  Easily up to the standards of a German restaurant.  (I asked the waitress about it - it turns out, the chef recently immigrated from Germany, where he was a master chef. I have no doubt that, once he's saved up some money, he'll open a ultra high end restaurant rivalling the best in the city.  Meanwhile, this really is your chance to enjoy fine dining at a bargain price.)\n\nOne of the friends with whom I was dining had the butternut squash ravioli.  She commented the pasta was cooked al dente, to perfection, and the sauce was fantastic.   Topped with prawns that were apparently delicious as well.\n\nTrying to lose weight, but this place was too good to skip dessert.

Walking into your cafe is like stepping into a vibrant garden of edible delights, and I must say, I'm still floating on cloud nine from my last visit!\n\nLet's talk about the \""Nut-thing Better Acai\"" bowl first. If this bowl were a movie, it would sweep the Oscars. Picture this: a heavenly heap of organic acai, with banana and blueberries so fresh you’d think they just took a dip in the Fountain of Youth. And the star of the show? That decadent organic peanut butter sauce cascading over an A-list cast of banana, strawberries, kiwi, with a cameo of chia pudding, cacao nibs, and homemade granola that deserves its own spin-off series. Each spoonful was a blockbuster hit in my mouth!\n\nMoving on to the Tofuino Salad—this isn't just any salad; it's a crunchy, colorful carnival of joy! The kale was so tender it must have been hand-reared from infancy, and paired with the smoky tofu, it was like a sultry tango of flavors. The supporting cast of carrots, radish, and purple cabbage added just the right amount of crunch, making every bite a standing ovation.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the Grilled Please Sandwich. With its sunflower pesto and zen cheese, it's the kind of sandwich that brings peace talks to the table. It’s like if world leaders sat down and shared this sandwich, global harmony would be achieved before dessert.\n\nBuddha Full, you’re not just a cafe; you're a culinary utopia. Your plant-based prowess is turning this meat-eater into a frequent leaf-eater. Bravo, and see you soon—my taste buds insist on an encore!\n\nYours in veggie and fruit-filled delight,\n\nRuben"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP9SHoibPko_Itxrk79u3a907eXoAMmyrwogrr4\u0026fid=0x0:0x69f7141f6183455f""],""When"":""2024-4-29""},{""Name"":""Chloe Genargue"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWcB97SzXsMD6panoq_G9yq28plXwWkj0h7AznJw7Xc37ypMfg5=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Something I don’t take for granted is this go-to place before I head to work a few blocks away.

Really flavourful and a healthy portion.

Subtle espresso flavour and a bit of a saltiness in the crust. Pretty dense. A different take on tiramisu, but delicious!\nIced soul starter latte: Steamed milk with raw cacao, yerba mate, and various adaptogens (chaga, maca, and more).

I opted for one of their \""protein\"" smoothies on the menu. For a place that advertises protein smoothies, I found it very odd that the staff had absolutely zero idea of how many grams of protein the smoothie had. I asked them to check the nutrition facts label of the protein powder to clarify the grams but the staff told me they get the protein in bulk and do not have labels with that information. I was at a loss for words. I do also want to mention that the staff was almost shocked I was asking for the grams of protein, as if I was asking for information that is confidential.\n\nFor a smoothie I spent almost $15 on, I could not comprehend the fact that they had no ability to know how much protein was in their \""protein\"" smoothies. After I kept trying to get information, they informed me that it is 1 tablespoon of protein. How is 1 tablespoon considered a protein smoothie? ... After finishing my smoothie, I was left starving and feeling unsatisfied. Realistically, 1 tablespoon probably had 5 grams of protein which I feel is false advertising when calling it a protein smoothie. It honestly felt like I was drinking water because of the consistency and this is due to the lack of protein and substance.\n\nI feel ripped off and will not be coming here again due to the lack of knowledge as well as lack of value for the $13 I spent on a smoothie. Body energy club smoothies are $10 and their vegan protein powder has 30g of protein in a serving – much better value and leave you feeling full and satisfied."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPjgG_kKMICKmayWO471_hA4hkLFsq5vxxeJ0k2\u0026fid=0x0:0x38925ac94a15c9de""],""When"":""2024-9-3""},{""Name"":""Rhoxann R"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUdLaQ5HDJYIFXN4tUtLiDEBJJnoWxUAOJ2myCAS8HiCRvcsnXb=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Beautiful relaxing spot.

LoLo… Unafraid to share my glowing review, because it’s such a brutal world for good restaurants out here. Photos have a couple pieces eaten.. we couldn’t wait!\n\nWe walked in at 6pm right before the rush. There’s inside seating for maybe 24 people inside, and a couple tables outside. The inside decor is more casual and homey than slick and refined, so you know you’re paying for taste and the chefs’ skills rather than flash. And the prices were solid - we stuffed ourselves silly for $80 total after tip.\n\nThe server was very friendly and welcoming, even while we had to ask her to correct the order, and our food arrived in less time than it took for us to decide on what to order.\n\nReally loved the attention to detail, including generous and fresh salmon and tuna sashimi, right rice texture and temp, warm and crispy yam tempura along with a great variety in the veggie roll including oshinko, carrot, cuke, spinach and avo, buttery negitoro roll, and the tamago shining through in the Lady roll.\n\nThe hands-down showstopper of the night was the Dancing Unagi roll. I’ve never had such meltingly-tender, lovingly-torched crisp unagi and fresh and plump shrimp tempura together in one balanced, moreish bite. Not to mention the rice to filling ratio of all the rolls was perfect.\n\nMy only regret is not seeing a dessert menu.. a little cup of yuzu sorbet would have been the perfect ending!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMznozwI7sB4q17BgXslz-YWemu6rHwGtuyyaey\u0026fid=0x0:0x5deaaa64013527aa""],""When"":""2024-10-3""},{""Name"":""David Perel"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVwPnFlxHQW6CSgX-4tN9oirQxq9XUk3XFmTYxyAcB1z-NGqqUy=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good sushi at a reasonable price.

However, my recent visit left much to be desired, prompting me to reconsider my recommendations.\n\nFirstly, I was taken aback by the restaurant's stringent payment policy. Despite receiving a gift card for Christmas, I was informed upon arrival that Minemura Sushi does not accept gift cards—a baffling oversight for a contemporary establishment. This refusal to accommodate a common form of payment resulted in an immediate deduction of one star from my review.\n\nAs I delved into my meal, it became evident that the quality of produce fell short of expectations. The avocado, a staple ingredient in sushi, appeared lackluster and unappetizing. It's a basic principle: if it doesn't meet the standards of the kitchen, it shouldn't find its way onto customers' plates. This disregard for quality warranted another star deduction.\n\nFurthermore, the attention to detail in the presentation of the sushi rolls left much to be desired. The uneven distribution of sesame seeds on one of the rolls resulted in an unpleasant taste imbalance, detracting from what should have been a harmonious flavor profile. This oversight, while seemingly minor, significantly impacted my dining experience, leading to the deduction of yet another star.\n\nIn summary, my experience at Minemura Sushi merits a modest two-star rating. Despite its upscale ambiance, the lack of flexibility in payment options, subpar produce quality, and inconsistencies in presentation leave much room for improvement. With numerous sushi establishments in the vicinity, I would advise exploring alternative dining options for a more satisfying experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNZIw3IDeidf0Dzk6076xTQJg5vCEFF6EuVo4mW\u0026fid=0x0:0x5deaaa64013527aa""],""When"":""2024-1-31""},{""Name"":""Courtney Mcmillan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV9e8pIj3cde718oXfswr3cNq5cypWdz2aMumiXWDawGh6R_kDT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I ordered some basic rolls, but it hit the spot!

While running some final errands before heading to the airport, I decided to check out this well-known restaurant which has been in business on the Northshore for many years, and was known as \""Kypriaki Taverna\"" in its former nearby Marine Drive location.\n\nThe restaurant is open daily between 12 - 9pm, and has both lunch + dinner menus. On-site customer parking is also available in a lot behind the building.  Kypriaki Mediterranean Grill is located mid-block near the northwest corner of Marine Drive and Bridgman Avenue and nearby Pemberton Plaza.\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant at noon opening, we received a really great welcome.  The lunch menu was in effect with many really tasty options. I chose the generously portioned baked Italian lasagna, while the family friend had the chicken souvlaki, with rice pilaf, and Greek salad.\n\nGreek cuisine is their speciality, and they are well-known for their tasty  Roast Lamb, Moussaka and Beef/Chicken Souvlaki, as well as Spanish Paella . Classic rich Greek  desserts like Baclava and Bougatsa are also on offer, and not to be missed.\n\nThe interior restaurant space has a great casual Mediterranean vibe: think light ochre + blue accented walls, landscape canvasses on wall / plants,  country - wood furniture, and overall warm rustic charm.\n\nThere is also a sports bar/lounge side of the restaurant with tables/comfy chairs, bar-stools, and 3 big-screens showing football/hockey games. Their daily Happy Hour drink/food specials runs between 4 - 5pm.   During Spring/Summer  there is an outdoor patio area along the front of the restaurant.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual Greek -  Mediterranean restaurant with longstanding reputation and delicious food at reasonable prices, you definitely have to check out Kypriaki."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPxOfFIjSqhLEMKiydwG22gkC4CleoBZ_LarrtG\u0026fid=0x0:0x67e12243d5a5f6c2""],""When"":""2024-11-12""},{""Name"":""R M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX_fz1ppRTsIp4sjPAQMlDnN0i9UFP0hSxVQWeP4OaNSz_YsQXRew=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""First time dining at Kypriaki Restaurant, and we had such a great time!

The spring roll is crispy and tasty relative to other Thai places. The red curry with beef was suggested, but the red curry didn’t have enough flavor and tasted too fatty and lacked that special touch. I had only two spoons and did not enjoy. The chicken cashew nut was good and was a generous portion and higher than usual number of cashew nuts. I appreciate they cut the cucumber Thai style in fried rice but didn’t try it so cannot comment (my friends order). In general I was happy with here. The curry was not was I was hoping for though and I hardly ate it/did not enjoy. The rest was good. In general one big drawback with this restaurant is that it is really dark and I never get a pleasant feeling walking in. I am very familiar with Thai food and the competition in Vancouver so 4 stars by me means it’s good. I’m considering taste and cost. The atmosphere is super super dark and would lower the score heavily if considered important. The personal experience I had was the service was good and thankfully they don’t charge or make a big deal for containers.\nBased on other reviews I would not try the pad Thai. Also I heard the owners are Chinese and thus not authentic but personally I have had Thai food that was really bad by Thai owners in Vancouver so that’s not what I consider."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMt--O-mHtmhzARPbHeAiXGnE4h1GQhqXjR7m7q\u0026fid=0x0:0x36b8f243dd8b10ab""],""When"":""2023-6-27""},{""Name"":""Yuen Man Chan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWT_q7sVSjzZETYsKUTINR0iUXRjPeUIedbgF9CysStAEsoqP21fA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The rice and noodles were the best; the sauce in the noodles was good.

If you can handle the heat from the karaage, you’ll find the ramen tangy and thoroughly enjoyable. However, I found it a bit odd that you’re required to finish every last drop of the broth to earn a stamp on the loyalty card. Is this tied to some Japanese tradition? I’m not sure, but it definitely caught me off guard.\n\nThe place itself has a neat, upscale, and intimate vibe that makes it perfect for a cozy meal.

Review updated to reflect the experience.\n\nDid a pick up order of the \""Nat's beef dip\"". It was very underwhelming. The beef itself was relatively tender, but \""piled high\"" on the menu meant about 2 or 3 slices of beef which was underseasoned and flavorless. The beef itself was overcooked and dry (refer to picture) The au jus was okay. The garlic bread that it was made with didn't have any garlic flavor and was also dry to the point where I had to add some mayo.\n\nI requested napkins and utensils but wasn't given any.\n\nThe side Caesar salad it came with was decent.\n\nOverall, not worth the 24 bucks for a sandwich and a salad."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMP3YUgzus40tOAfFNX-__8uRTIIhyrBomvwTMI\u0026fid=0x0:0x6d94cf6f3b8dcf79""],""When"":""2024-12-4""},{""Name"":""Sam Chang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVSeVO8E3yvku7uop8tLoVEGM_NaXzKBAia20QDNEQRDvXqDThPZA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Good quality food.

Sushi Bella is now advertising a discount for 5-star reviews—5% off your bill for inflated ratings.\n\nI’ve been coming to Sushi Bella for the last 5 years, but sadly, every visit has shown a noticeable deterioration in both food and service. They used to deliver exceptional meals with warm hospitality, but that’s no longer the case.\n\nDuring my recent visit, the service was just okay but felt distinctly unwelcoming. Near the end of our meal, the sushi chefs began arguing loudly, followed by slamming plates, which made for an uncomfortable dining experience.\n\nWhile the food itself was good, it took an unreasonably long time to arrive. Adding to the disappointment, the restaurant had a noticeable issue with fruit flies, which diminished the overall enjoyment.\n\nTo top it off, prices have continued to climb without any visible improvements in quality.

They offered to send new pizzas, but it was already late and I had to prepare other food for my son.

Recently, I've been studying there for an upcoming exam, spending 3-4 hours each afternoon after peak hours when the indoor part of the cafe is mostly empty. I regularly order lunch/pastry and multiple drinks throughout the day. Today, an older man, who I assume is the owner, approached me and told me I had to leave after finishing my drink due to a one-hour policy that he curtly asked me if I had read. I said no, I hadn't known about that policy, so he asked passively-aggressively if I considered my presence the past few days there to be \""overkill.\"" I was taken aback because I’ve always been considerate, and would never stay long unless there were plenty of free tables (15+ free spots around me today). I also have seen many groups stay well over an hour or two without any issue. I explained that if the cafe were busy, I would have left but with so much space available, I didn’t think that my presence was unwelcome. He then handed me a coupon for a free coffee, which felt insulting given that I was being asked to leave. I left my half-full drink and the coupon on the table, hurt and embarrassed. As a university student who has spent the majority of the past four years studying in cafes, I never could have imagined an interaction like this. I wish I had stood up for myself better. Given how I was treated, I sadly won't be returning."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Ordering online is very quick and easy - I think our first ever online order didn’t go through, but the gentleman in the store was so great that he made our pizza right away when we showed up. Our next times ordering online had no issues, and he even asked us how our experience was ordering online. The gentleman is very friendly and cares a lot about his pizza and his customers.

They even had a dog menu, which I thought was cute.\n\nI love that they’re a sustainable shop, not offering paper take away cups. They promote “BYOC”, meaning bring your own cup. However, if you’re an out of towner like me, you have the option to enjoy your coffee in house, buy a $3 reusable cup to keep, OR borrow their take away mug, which they allow you to return within 14 days.\n\nI tried their caramel latte with almond milk and it was really good.

With its cozy, eco-friendly vibe, it was the perfect place to grab a quick coffee before the adventure. We ordered a cappuccino and a latte, and they were simply amazing—smooth, rich, and just what we needed to recharge!\n\n🌿 Nomad stands out not only for its great coffee but also for its commitment to sustainability. It’s one of the first coffee shops to eliminate single-use cups, encouraging customers to bring their own. The minimal yet stylish decor, filled with greenery, adds to the relaxed atmosphere, making it an inviting spot for both a quick coffee or a sit-down.\n\n🍞 Unfortunately, we were in a bit of a rush and didn’t get a chance to try any of their freshly baked goods, but they looked delicious! From croissants to cookies, the bakery section is definitely something we’ll come back for next time we’re in the area.\n\n⭐️ Overall, Nomad Coffee \u0026 Bakery is a hidden gem in North Vancouver.

Fine Tacos Restaurant for my bday party for 20 people this Saturday and everything went beyond my expectations! To beging with, the place had outstanding food with lots of classic dishes and more original options to choose from. No matter from we ordered though, everything tasted spectacular and we barely left any food on our plates, as people went to order multiple times throughout the night. Another fun part about this place is it’s way of serving! It’s so innovative and cute to see your order come up on the little train tray, as you then go to pick it up. It really adds to the fun atmosphere of the place, and also gives you lots of privacy, no matter whether you ordering just as a regular customer or having a little party there 🎉 People and I also loved the drinks, as all of them matched the style of the fine tacos dining experience. The place offers some authentic tasting margaritas and micheladas. Oh and one more thing - the service. It was so nice 🙌🏻 the owner, the manager of the place and the rest of the crew were very nice, helpful and professional. I always felt like they listen and were ready to help, as they love their customers. I highly recommend Cornelia Fine Tacos!

Where do I start? First incident: pick up my order, get in my car, check my order and find a shrimp dish which I didn’t order but missing my beef dish. I went back inside and told the son of the owner about the mistake. He said I ordered it so I need to keep it but I can buy an extra beef dish. I explained to him I didn’t order this dish and would NEVER, EVER,  order a shrimp dish as my son is allergic to shrimp. I suggest he might have made a mistake with another customer’s order. He said that he did not and that was on my order. I argued with him and he finally change it for my beef dish.\n\nSecond incident: Went back because there is not much choice for Chinese food in North Van. Well, bad decision! Pre-ordered my meal ahead of time because I needed to pick up my son at soccer then drop off the food at home with my son, and drive my other son to hockey. When I got to the restaurant, the owner told me my husband already picked up my order which he didn’t. It turned out they give my order to another customer so they have to make mine from scratch again. The owner, her daughter and the cook started screaming at each other in Chinese about the mix up.\n\nI had to tell them to stop arguing, do it when I am gone, and to hurry to prepare my order……. I had to come back in 20 min which made me late for my son, the other one drop off, etc. The best/worse part…… I finally came back to pick up my order and I asked for a discount on my meal (they didn’t offer) as their mix up caused me a lot of hassles. The owner offered few dollars off. I said the inconvenience they caused me worth much more than few dollars and that their customer service was sub par. I told they have no business etiquette.\n\nThe 18 yo daughter joined the discussion and told me I was insensitive to their business! Who made the mistake? I told them that they should assume their mistakes and not make the such a big deal about it. The daughter got upset and told me to get in my car.

We aren't sure if it's just because we've tried so many other sushi restaurants at this point but their food just isn't as tasty in comparison anymore.

Hot sake and beers, were up to expectations.\n\nI'm rating the service lower than the food, Not because anyone was unprofessional or rude, but rather because there is a significant gap and potential for improvement when compared to other competitors. They can help you feel more relaxed, check in on you more frequently, and make sure everyone is taken care of and has what they need.\nI didn't like receiving the appetisers with my meal either, and I like restaurants that follow the standard order of appetisers followed by the main course, and so on.\nI want to emphasise that this is a proposal to enhance the service, keeping in mind that we were likely the last customers and that the personnel may have been worn out from a long day.\n\nThe surroundings was another drawback. It was far too dark, and I thought the interior could use some updating for a more contemporary, clean design.\n\nOverall a good experience because of the high food quality.\n\nPros:\n\n- Excellent food quality.\n- Appropriate portion sizes.\n- Fair prices.\n\nCons:\n\n- The quality of the service fell short of that of other similar places.\n- interior was too dark and a bit old."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMnnIb5pLueZXhlxzDY5y6OP7GClaf0rVAmzNw\u0026fid=0x0:0xe90c924d72795abe""],""When"":""2023-7-4""}]",

Not to mention, not a long wait at all. We were 3rd in line and maybe waited 8 minutes max. The food looked exactly like the pictures and was even more fresh and amazing than I was expecting- again, judging off location in a mall lol.

I am happy to report that at the new Edgemont location, everything was as it should be (sans the newspaper wrapping) and my parents, expecting disappointment, loved it! Unlike the competition, the batter, which, like it or not is crucial to fish and chips, was flavorful and crisp through and through, while the fish inside was soft and tender. As importantly, the halibut actually tasted like halibut, and the cod like cod; where normally the fish at its competitors is usually overcooked to disadvantage of both taste and texture; likely in service of cooking a less porous batter mixture that resists quick and easy crisping.\nThe fish portions were generous (a single piece was sufficient where often it is not), and the chips were authentically crisp and lightly oiled to a deep-fried delight. I can’t say how healthy any of it is, but as I mentioned, by parents have made it to there 90’s without challenges to there health, and are still enjoying this simple and delicious treat. On occasion of wanting something “healthy”, we’ve chosen to forego “fish and chips” rather than suffer a tepid experience of something that should ‘be’…FISH AND CHIPS!

During my first visit, I was thrilled to find the nostalgic sandwiches I had been longing for. They were nothing short of awesome, amazing, and exactly what we crave. The staff was incredibly friendly, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The dining area provided a comfortable space to enjoy the delicious sandwiches. To add to the nostalgia, Haida Sandwich offers nostalgic pops like Istak (Flavored Non-Alcoholic Beer), which enhanced the experience even further.\n\nWhat's truly remarkable is that our non-Iranian friends thoroughly enjoyed their visit too. The Kielbasa (Deli) they savored was bursting with taste, and the bread was wonderfully fresh. This is a testament to the quality and craftsmanship that Haida Sandwich puts into every aspect of their menu.\n\nIf you're seeking a taste of nostalgia, paired with exceptional flavors and friendly service, Haida Sandwich is the place to be. From the delightful sandwiches to the inviting atmosphere, it's an experience that will leave you satisfied and longing for more."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOEjG7RxIh78x4Az4nfkkoLRKD-8k6zfrZicl8j\u0026fid=0x0:0x20d2fd7c4f62c85d""],""When"":""2023-7-19""}]",

service! We waited for about a solid 20 minutes before the waitress came for our order. The restaurant was pretty much empty. There were some take out orders but nothing that seems to justify such a long wait. When the food finally started to arrive we had to ask for plates. She just dropped the plates on the corner of the table. No soya sauce plates. I’m used to get my tea cup filled constantly in Japanese restaurant. There we had to ask for it, our cups were cold that’s how long we had to wait. Perhaps the best option is to do take out for this place but there are lots of very good Japanese places in North Van.

We came here for the first time a few weeks ago and had a2 of their bars that were good and a “pumpkin knot” that was so delicious we drove 35 minutes back here today. Sadly they didn’t have any knots, which was no biggie, so we chose a pistachio croissant, artichoke tart, and raspberry “bomb” as well as two medium coffees.\n\nUnfortunately we didn’t really enjoy any of the food. The raspberry “bomb” was just an empty cavity with the smallest smear of raspberry jam that I could barely taste - there was such little filling that I actually went up and asked the staff if there was supposed to be more because it’s called a “bomb” and they politely explained that was normal. The artichoke tart was quite over cooked, quite greasy, and was very skimpy on the toppings and just felt like a light sprinkle of cheese with 2 small pieces of artichoke on puff pasty - didn’t feel like a “tart” really. The croissant was soooooo greasy and heavy; it tasted like it had marzipan inside (maybe pistachio marzipan?) which wasn’t in the description. Lastly, we wanted to dine in, so we got our coffees in mugs - the mugs were so small, there is no chance those are equivalent to a medium to-go cup so this really felt like a waste of money.\n\nThe servers were all friendly and helpful, and the vibe is super cute. Since our first time there was so good, we might be willing to try again if we’re in the area - but would be more thoughtful about what we order and also would order drinks in to-go cups."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOaMzFtrYIcAZ9o8LkOZTKAzf3Iw_6XYLhIpEIe\u0026fid=0x0:0xdd7b5bcbec1d6f44""],""When"":""2023-11-20""},{""Name"":""Mehr Poulad"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKnMmsASCmXLOvaFhR1RoQ03vxNx7oVUBdwy_npEYvb7k7uZA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Such a gem.

We have been here a couple of times, so I’d personally rate the meat Austin/ Angus \u003e Encino/ Chicken \u003e Wilbur/ Pork. The green sauce is yummy, the red sauce is very spicy. 🌶️. Food wise, they don’t serve and complementary chips or anything. So, for the experience it feels like you are at a dine in restaurant, but the food portions are very basic. Food Presentation and quality are a step above Chipotle, but Chipotle has them on selection of condiments and volume. 80s retro vibes and play list was super fun.

I just want you to know that there are too many changes that they made this place to look and feel super greedy.\nLeave the fact that the taste is not the same. It still good soup. Look at the sizing that’s a whiskey glass, you put only 1/3 of the amount of the chicken in the chicken soup. Very disappointing. I heard it from other regulars that they said that it’s not the same and it’s a sad place and I could understand because of the circumstances. This place used to have a lineup all the time.
