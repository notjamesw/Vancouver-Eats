The overall portions have gotten smaller as well. I ended up spending $51 one large house special, one small meatball pho, and one order of spring rolls.

Especially when it’s a wee bit chilly outside.  I found the soup broth had slightly sweet notes and for a small size I had plenty of meats to go with the sprouts and chili peppers.

The blueberries, bursting with freshness, added a vibrant sweetness that complemented the tangy richness of the cake.

Despite the restaurant not being very busy, our server seemed disinterested and hardly checked on us. We had to flag them down multiple times just to get basic things like water refills.\n\nThe food, which I was looking forward to the most, was underwhelming. The pierogi were bland, lacking any real flavor or seasoning, and the filling was far too dry. The borscht was greasy and tasted more like something that had been reheated multiple times rather than freshly made. It was also way too salty, which made it hard to finish.\n\nThe manager/owner, when I raised my concerns, was dismissive and unhelpful. Rather than apologizing or offering a solution, they seemed indifferent to our experience. It’s always frustrating when management doesn’t take feedback seriously, and it only made the situation worse. It felt like they weren’t interested in improving their service or maintaining customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I won’t be returning.

We were warmly welcomed by every face in there, each person said hello with a smile. The lady behind the counter (I'm assuming the owner?) welcomed us as if we were long-time customers and because of this we instantly knew the food here would be made with love. The atmosphere was very warm and family-oriented. It makes you feel like you're in a safe space and it is very comfortable in there.\n\nWe ordered the donair combos, I had beef with everything and all sauces and my partner had chicken with everything but no hot sauce. The combos came with fries and a can of pop.\n\nThese are some of the best donairs we've ever eaten! And they were huge! The beef and the chicken were season nicely and they were very juicy and fresh. They load it up with meat! The vegetables were fresh, crunchy, and juicy.. it was pleasant. And the sauces were flavourful and delicious. They put just the right amount of everything in these donairs, all of the flavours balance out perfectly.\n\nThe fries are their own catagory- they are so fresh and crispy! Wow! No seasoning or salt is needed on these fries, they are delicious by themselves. We did, however, put the last few bites of our donairs into the fries and mixed it up. And it was a fantastic combination. Highly recommend.\nWe will be back to try the poutine when we are in the area.\n\nMy partner has their heart set on 1 donair place in vancouver as their all-time favorite but they said Uncle Moe's is easily the next pick. As for myself, I say Uncle Moe's has the best donair.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this place to any donair lover, you will not be disappointed in any aspect! 5 stars all across the board.

We gave a 5 for atmosphere as we have read reviews stating how comfortable the diner is and therefore had to give a 5 for that reason. We had the Bacon Cheeseburger and Clubhouse sandwich. Both were delicious. My husband said that the burger is one of the best that he has had. The burger was loaded with tomatoes, bacon and onions and he really liked the burger sauce that came with it as well. The bacon was thick and my husband said that the caramelized onions made the burger. I also found my Clubhouse to have been very good also with thick bacon, ham, and a generous amount of grilled chicken. The fries were crispy and the picture with the Clubhouse did not have all the fries that came with the order. We both have left overs for tomorrow. We are always cautiously optimistic when ordering home delivery due to the food not being fresh out of the kitchen. Well, we were so pleased with our meals and will definitely be ordering again. We are looking forward to trying out more items on the menu.

Over the next six months, we came back multiple times, mainly to enjoy their udon and creamy udon dishes.\n\nAlthough there’s quite a distance from where I live to here, I’m more than willing to take the trip just to visit again! Wishing your business continued success, and thank you so much for providing such amazing Korean cuisine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOi77AO_2BLOY6EeE011HSVXP_TclX9nfsLjD4-\u0026fid=0x0:0x32c61bd38a609209""],""When"":""2024-12-22""},{""Name"":""Ellen Tsang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXzoh866OovBfVlMHdFGLQnEdLyB97Utya-3yzGLsM4EYweL6y3=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Delicious korean food.

To start, we were served spoiled squid, which is completely unacceptable, especially for someone who is pregnant.\n\nAfter we told the server, they offered a discount as a form of compensation. However, when they got wind of our intention to report this incident to the health department, they shamefully retracted the discount. They said they are being generous and take our intention to report as a threat. Also, they emphasize that we have to be responsible for what we order, but we didn’t expect to get the spoiled food. To make matters worse, they even summoned the police to coerce us into paying the full amount. And they take away the dishes but never serve us a new one, so basically we paid full price for nothing.\n\nThis level of disregard for both customer well-being and basic ethics is inexcusable. It's disheartening to see such a blatant lack of responsibility and accountability from the management. I strongly advise anyone, especially those who are pregnant or have health concerns, to steer clear of this establishment.\n\nThe blatant disregard for food safety and the mistreatment of patrons is simply unacceptable.

Whether with my family or just the two of us, we’ve enjoyed countless breakfasts here, including many Mother’s Day and Father’s Day celebrations. The restaurant's modern design and simplicity create an upscale breakfast experience, even though it maintains a casual and welcoming vibe.\n\nSeating is limited, and I still recall waiting outside with social distancing protocols in place during the early post-COVID days. Last week, we visited again, and as always, I ordered my favorite: chicken waffles with whipped cream and strawberry topping on the side. My wife, on the other hand, loves trying something different every time we visit. The food arrived quickly, and as usual, it was very tasty.\n\nHowever, (our visit on Nov 30th)  I do want to share one piece of feedback from this visit. My wife and I were enjoying our coffee after finishing our meal when the server brought the check—completely understandable, especially when tables need to turn over for waiting guests. But this time, there were four empty tables, and no one was waiting. Moments later, while we were still sipping our coffee, the server returned with the cordless payment unit and stood by our table. We were both caught off guard, thinking, “What…?” We paid because the payment unit was already there, and the server was waiting, but the interaction felt rushed.\n\nHaving owned a restaurant in downtown Vancouver, I understand the need to turn tables efficiently. That said, there’s an unspoken etiquette between servers and guests, and this instance felt a bit abrupt—particularly since the restaurant wasn’t busy.  It’s a small issue, and I’m sure it wasn’t intentional, but I wanted to share this experience in the hopes it’s not repeated for other guests.\n\nOf course, we will continue visiting Big Flat Pancake because we love the food, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is just some constructive feedback for management or ownership to consider.\n\nThank you, and see you again soon!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN3DgZTp8jMRgeo2EOBKceMPW-1SSt0lYSYOwaO\u0026fid=0x0:0xaaebff47a4a99ef2""],""When"":""2024-12-10""}]",

It is somewhere between the Neapolitan thin-ness and like a “standard pizza”. Best of both worlds.\n\nToppings were not too heavy but I think there is pizza science out there with a toppings to crust ratio. If you want a stack of toppings add more.\n\nCheese was light but again I think this is purposeful and it works with the rest of it, but if you need to live the cheezy life, just add more of it.\n\nI was very annoying by accident and I made a few special requests while it was busy on a Friday not knowing this place is actually quite popular and busy. They accommodated my requests anyway.\n\nOnline ordering was easy and the timeline was reliable.

They seemingly opened quietly during COVID so I wasn't too sure what to expect and I'm sure a lot of people also don't realize that this location is here. So that's why I really wanted to try it out and leave a review, because I think there's great potential here and I hope they get more business!\n\nI've been here twice now, as of this review, and I think this is the type of spot where they do some dishes well, and others not as much. I often find that to be the case for restaurants with larger menus, not every place can do every dish well, and I think that's understandable! So your experience here could definitely vary depending on what you choose to order. The first time we came we ordered the Kung Pao chicken because another review said they enjoyed it, but we found it to be pretty \""meh\"" and just okay. So the next time we came we ordered a different chicken dish, the General Tsao's Chicken, and we like that one much better! Much better flavour!\n\nOther dishes that we enjoyed were the Xiao Long Bao (a dish Peaceful Restaurant is known for), the Beef Rolls (another dish they're known for), the Spicy Gingered Beef, the Vegetable \u0026 Tofu Stir-fried Noodles, and the Sichuan Stir-fried Noodles. The broth in the Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai soup-filled dumplings) was delicious and went well with the vinegar they serve it with, the vinegar really helps to cut the richness of the broth and pork filling.\n\nThe noodles also had a great texture to them, a nice bounce and chewiness that was satisfying. The Sichuan Stir-fried Noodles were my favourite as they also had a nice light heat to them. I will say that the \""Spicy\"" Gingered Beef isn't very spicy but that may be a good or bad thing depending on who you ask. It's still very tasty regardless of if you're a spice fan or not!\n\nI had family members who visited on a separate occasion from me and they said they wouldn't recommend the fried rice (a category I didn't try on my visits) and that the squid had good flavour but was not crispy enough! So maybe keep those notes in mind when you're deciding what to order!\n\nNow, the ambiance at the restaurant is where I think there could definitely be improvement. It's very clean and quiet in the restaurant, but a little too quiet as there's no music at all! So if you go on a quiet night it's a bit strange having it be so silent. I'd recommend they put some light background music of some kind on and it would be much better.\n\nAlso in terms of ambiance, they don't provide regular eating utensils, but plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates and cups. Yes this does upset me as someone who hates single use waste, but I do understand that they opened during covid and it seems to be very quiet for dine in (at least when we've gone). I suspect that they may also be short staffed, so this might be a way for them to keep costs low and keep workloads manageable with only a few staff members.\n\nI definitely hope in future that they will move toward regular cutlery and plates, but if this would be a deal breaker for your dine-in experience, then I recommend trying take out! I did see quite a few take out orders get picked up so that's definitely an option some customers are choosing, and it makes sense.\n\nAside from the music and dinnerware, the waitress was very friendly and attentive, which we appreciated. Parking is also plentiful so there's no issues there. The price is not bad at all  either, we always get at least another meal or two as leftovers so it's good value! My hope for this place is that it can work toward building a better ambiance and that people will still give it a try as they work toward that transition. I think there's room for improvement but I also think there's definitely some things they're doing well!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP0DwGVQ0f-1evWkGfS9MOh0jP9iL_22siWwZpO\u0026fid=0x0:0x9d1f8426af958dd1""],""When"":""2021-9-23""}]",

was a disastrous take-out order on Christmas Day. The restaurant was quite pack, as expected being Christmas Day and I am sure the quality is questionable. I ordered 6 dishes.\n1. Diced chicken with salted fish \u0026 tofu - 90% tofu, 10% chicken and definitely no salted fish. The looks of it is very unappetizing and virtually tasteless.\n2. Yan's House special sparerib - clearly they gave me the wrong order and it turned out to be honey garlic spareribs\n3. Deep fried squid with peppery salt - completely with any trace of peppery salted other then it is deep fried and the flour batter would not stick to the squid.\n4. Beef with string beans in black bean sauce - 90% of string beans and few slices of beef with no taste of the black bean sauce\n5. Deep fried prawns with pumpkin and salted egg yolk - 5 pieces of prawns and the rest is pumpkin. Absolutely too little of the salted egg yolk\n6. Fried vermicelli - too ordinary\n\nTo sum it up, the restaurant was all about rushing through the orders and sacrificing quality. We dined in several months ago and it was just an average family restaurant. So we though we would order take out for our Christmas lunch but it turned out to be very bad. There is an inherent risk whenever you order take-out because you never know what's inside the packaging. I thought is was a waste of my time to call the restaurant to complain. Damage was already done, so the recourse is to write this review and I hope the restaurant owner reads it.So beware if you planning to go there.\nWill never step in there again.\nIf I can award No Star, I would have done it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNT1ITY_zzDiLe563LK-JCNe0dhqGcMowqgERQR\u0026fid=0x0:0x8b30f4df92938c89""],""When"":""2024-12-26""},{""Name"":""Regie Sacdalan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLVDuCV38ynK6mxDdP-HlWdoPODHVpBYeLjIOghxaV1fgHRoA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It's no wonder why this place has such a high Google review rating!

Love this authentic Japanese family run sushi restaurant. My friends and I have eaten sushi of all quality and price points from Asia and North America and this place does not disappoint. Their pricing is super on the low end but their quality and selection is amazing. They get their fish fresh from Japan and their 10pc nigiri omakase is beyond amazing at only $42!! You can get a similar deluxe nigiri set from Octopus garden at $80 but this place totally takes it at value!\n\nThis place is in a quiet place in Coquitlam but totally worth the drive from downtown Vancouver.\n\nHighly recommend this place!!!\n\nPro tip: when ordering the spot prawn, always ask for the head to be deep fried.

Glad to see it's still here and I'm visiting again after 20+ years. All I remember was that I liked their hot and sour soup.\n\nNot really an authentic Szechuan restaurant. 30 years ago, most chinese cuisines were cooked by hong kongers or south chinese people. So, most of these dishes are going to be a southern take on it.\n\nHot and sour soup - price is awesome. $11 enough for at least 6 bowls. Souo base is missing a bit of flavor but it is jam packed with ingredients.\n\nDrunken chicken - it was ok. Little on the salty side.\n\nShanghainese pan fried pork buns - these were probably the worst I've had. Not made in house and not properly pan fried. No juice, super dry, no fried bottom crust.\n\nBean curd wrapped pork dim sum - surprisingly this came out last. At least 20 min has passed. This is a steamed dish but it came out with dried edges like it was sitting on a dry heater. Taste was ok.\n\nMapo tofu - asked for extra spicy and extra numbing. Numbing was there but nowhere near real szechuan numbing. Was not spicy at all. Sauce was more oily than saucey.\n\nThe price point reflects the quality. Things are either mediocre or a complete miss. Would come again to try only the better stuff. Staff was friendly. Came to try to refill the tea way more times than normal. The iron goddess tea tastes much better than a lot of dim sum places elsewhere."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOsyXtmZVjFTpSM7j5XHpsMqasJjiN51hrkn9sk\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c85358e6c767e95""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""Sarah Grace"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX0P_FT3n0HZdmLMDEJ6UcRFNPyHbE7QJ8GW3gOL-SGGTFh-sFdQw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good Chinese food, some of the best we’ve tried!

My husband is addicted to the Korean pork and when I p/u my lunch I usually bring it home for dinner now. Haha I'm lucky to get any. They also have a bunch of new dessert squares which are just as addicting. Highly recommend 👏👏\n\nPrevious review\nAmazing Korean pork on Thursday and spicy Korean chicken on Tuesdays! The Shepard's pie is also on Thursday and delicious. They do a chicken Katsu with curry that's very well done and their chicken Blt sandwiches are so good too! The chicken sandwiches are made with the schnitzel and pounded until tender and thin, lightly fried and crispy. The specials are typically served with salad but you can have soup instead.\n\nThe specials change every day- so usually 2-4  hot dishes plus 2 soups rotating daily. In addition, there's a sandwich bar menu with many different types of hot and cold sandwiches and made fresh to order. (Salads are as well) U can choose your toppings and dressings and select between different bread types, or different buns, or a wrap.\n\nThe dessert available fluctuates- usually they have a selection of a few of these; lemon coconut, Nanaimo bar, oat fudge, triple chocolate brownie, peanut butter bar, Rocky road and then a selection of huge cookies - peanut butter dipped in chocolate, oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip. Chips, candy bars, gum and beverages too\n\nThe service is really what makes this place stand out. It's a well oiled machine for one; they all work in amongst each other very well, and know where the next staff is going to move next. They are super fast and efficient even with a huge line I've never waited long. They're super sweet and accommodating and so friendly! They try to accommodate anything you ask of them and never seem put out. I'm here every week as a result of the service. In a world where service seems to be lacking and most fast casual places full of either under trained or uninterested staff, this place is a gem! Oh, and it's SUPER CLEAN! Even when they're super busy the place is spotless. Both behind the line and in the restaurant area. It's an open kitchen and prep area too and it's literally kept impeccable and they have fantastic hygiene.

Hawaiian roll with the deep fried garlic and ponzu sauce was just the perfect roll, also a must get. Godzilla roll was very much like the roll’s name and was so delicious! Such a bang for your buck.

Well......standards....let's leave it there.\n\nThe Canuck French Toast -\nDecent. It came with back bacon instead of strip.

Finally decided for a revisit to this place which I haven’t been to for years.\n\nInside is one of those smaller cozy place; clean, typical and nothing too fancy. I was glad the server seated me on a bigger table instead one of those midget size ones. The server informed me they have a Tri-city special set menu for $35, quick glanced and I opted out on that. Here were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Miso soup (complimentary). Pretty basic but thank you, nice to have a hot soup to warm up to from the cold.\n2. Appetizer tempura. Pretty basic and as it should be.\n3. Oyster motoyaki. I was glad they were on the shell but didn’t know it’s their own version of it; cold, marinated with cold pan fried onions on top. The cold oysters didn’t really do it for me. Is it really that hard to find just the basic fresh oyster motoyaki baked with Japanese mayo anywhere? lol\n4. Foie gras nigiri. Okay this is one of those must order item from here. Loved how the way it is put together and seared. Rich, buttery and creamy that literally melts in your mouth. Very nice!\n5. Spider roll. A little bit too basic, could be more generous on the soft shell crab.\n6. Saba shio yaki. It was okay, pretty straightforward dish.\n7. Assorted sashimi. It was okay, the Akami could be a better cut.\n8. Chopped scallops, uni, amaebi nigiris. The chopped scallop was fresh, the uni was a generous amount, I like how the amaebi head was prepared so easier to eat.\n9. Albacore toro, Akami, chu toro. The albacore toro was a bit dry, the Akami was fresh, the chu toro just make it to the satisfactory level (as you can tell it lost some of its beautiful colour already).\n\nThe restaurant is conveniently located on the corner of Lougheed Hwy and Shaughnessy Street in Port Coquitlam. There are plenty of free parkings in the plaza. Inside the restaurant offers a causal comfortable dining atmosphere.\n\nThe food was okay, could be better in some departments, but overall satisfactory level.\n\nAs for the service, the staffs here were very friendly and welcoming.

tonight from Dinakis (through skip the dishes). Ordered my regular Greek dish, the chicken souvlaki. I often order from another restaurant but thought I would give Dinakis a try. Upon eating my chicken souvlaki skewer, I noticed the taste and texture of the chicken seemed off. To my surprise the chicken was raw in the middle. The restaurant was immediately called to inform them. They stated that we needed to contact skip for a refund (which is fine!) and said the chicken was raw due to how busy the restaurant was tonight. Unfortunately, I do not see this as a valid reason for serving undercooked meat. They offered to remake the meal and have me come and pick it up. Unfortunately with a baby in bed, leaving the house is not option which is why I ordered in.\n\nI’ll no longer be order from Dinakis.

I really appreciated the fact that they put on new plastic wrap after I used the machine. Unfortunately I found the food quality not what I'm used to when going to a nice Greek restaurant. The portions were a good size and could easily feed 3-4 people. It might be that these dishes are better when eaten in but I found the lamb lacking the juiciness and the calamari was flat. I found some dishes a bit on the salty side and it almost felt like I was eating leftovers rather than take out.

I think even the Ferry's legendary burger isn't like this. We called and the manager confirmed that was the correct burger but was kind enough to offer another burger with actual toppongs. The rest of the food was good but the shock from the over priced plain burger is hard to forget. Don't be tricked! Just got the replacement burger.. it was not cooked. Also found a rotten grape in the mixed fruit.

Father's Day with a lunch at Kisso Sushi, a spot that has become a bit of a favorite for us. This time, there were six of us, and I had wisely booked in advance, which turned out to be a smart move as the restaurant was nearly full.\n\nThis was my third visit to Kisso Sushi, with my previous visits being just my wife and I. This time, we were seated at the booked bench seats, which were comfortable and offered a good view of the restaurant’s charming blend of traditional Japanese ambiance and modern design touches..\n\nOne of the standout features of Kisso Sushi is their use of technology. Each table is equipped with a tablet, making the ordering process incredibly convenient. Whether you need to place an order or request service, it can all be done through the tablet.\n\nAfter placing our orders, we had the unique experience of having our dishes delivered by a robotic server. It was quite a novelty and added a fun element to our meal. As for the food, it did not disappoint. The dishes were delicious, and the portions were generous.\n\nIn summary, Kisso Sushi provided us with a delightful dining experience for Father's Day. The combination of tasty food, substantial portions, and efficient service, all set in a beautifully designed space, ensures we'll be back for more. Highly recommended!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPO6u8yWJkEqcwhDv5acWee_n-dpaXn28mvd2l3\u0026fid=0x0:0x8fc73854e26bc0ef""],""When"":""2024-6-18""},{""Name"":""Jason Tribbiani"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXXpvlAY0NULhaj1b4k1yZZtRXFlzsqxg5gIO8-kzQ1-Qy-iq7d=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""**Rating: 4.5/5**\n\nWe discovered this restaurant by chance after a stop at Costco for gas and groceries, and it didn’t disappoint! The excellent reviews drew us in for a late lunch, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I ordered the miso ramen, which had a generous portion and was a fantastic deal. However, the beef tataki, while decent, could have been fresher and a bit more substantial for $17.\n\nOne standout for me was the Japanese black lager—it was hands down one of the best beers I’ve ever tasted. Rich, smooth, and perfectly balanced, it truly elevated the meal.\n\nThe service was exceptional, with friendly staff and quick, efficient table service. A fun bonus, especially for families, is the robot that delivers food to your table—kids were absolutely thrilled!

It is quite impressive that hey have quite many sauce and seasonings to choose from. If you do choose seasonings, it might not be season evenly. Spicy waffle fries was pretty crispy but it is not spicy at all, which is a little disappointing for my friends. Chipotle ranch steak salad is in good portion and the sauce is spicer than the spicy waffle fries.

Unfortunately, my daughter accidentally dropped her ice cream on the floor on our way to sit down. I took it back to the counter for disposal, hoping that given the small portion size meant for a child, the staff would replace it without charge. I was unwilling to pay another $5 for such a small amount. However, the staff simply threw it away without a word and continued to engage in personal conversations, laughing and looking at their phones.\n\nThis experience was disappointing on multiple levels. Firstly, the lack of customer service and empathy was disheartening, especially in a situation involving a small child. Secondly, the quality of the ice cream itself was subpar and quite flavorless. It is evident that the standards of this establishment have declined over the years.

The Tomato sauce is not bitter nor too sweet, just yummy and fresh  ;-).\n\nToppings and mozzarella have a very good price to quality ratio.\n\nAll the ingredients are really really fresh 👍\n\nA suggestion for them, I think you should make a pizza with different ingredients which are hard to find in PoCo\n\nAnd for me the most important thing , people in this pizza shop are really happy, hospitable, positive and energetic. They really smile to you because they just want to. The total vibe is just like the warm and welcoming family owned pizza shops in Italy too 😍😍.\n\nPs: I asked the owner to tour the kitchen because of my cleanliness obsession. And yes he let me to quickly tour the kitchen and I'm amazed, this is a really really clean kitchen for BC standarts 😉"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipODw8DnBQZ_EDJZzRNN9UlLF96GZOid--UDy1PJ\u0026fid=0x0:0x4640aee62581d2d2""],""When"":""2024-3-28""},{""Name"":""Aamir Sheergar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUTKU4wfuc0kwoyEwJxy3N-nmGgBy-VjbHs41hImisM4pU2gpbxyQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great pizza, loved the thin crust.

We recently dined there and had the Ferrari Pizza and the Funghi Pasta, and both dishes exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe Ferrari Pizza was a masterpiece of fresh ingredients and perfect execution. The thin, crispy crust paired beautifully with its rich toppings, striking the perfect balance between flavor and texture. It was clear that great care and quality ingredients went into every bite.\n\nThe Funghi Pasta was equally outstanding. The earthy richness of the mushrooms combined with a creamy sauce created a dish that was both comforting and indulgent. The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the flavors were well-balanced, making it one of the best pasta dishes we’ve had in a long time.\n\nThe Golden Boot offers more than just great food; it provides an inviting and cozy atmosphere that enhances the dining experience. The staff were warm, attentive, and knowledgeable, making our evening even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fresh and authentic Italian experience in Coquitlam, The Golden Boot is a gem worth discovering.

Quality of ingredients seem low, we are vegetarian/vegan but our table ate a lot of meat and the quality of cuts was very low, the brussel sprouts were tasty but low quality sprouts for sure. Just ingredients seem on the lower end. Also this comment is from my gf (give vegans a carb and they will drink more). The jackfruit vegan dish was literally nothing else but a plate of jackfruit which is pretty close to no calories (don't order this, waste of money). A bun jackfruit sandwich would suffice way better. Service was ok not great. The tofu bites were incredible through and through. Oh dishes are very small don't come hungry.

She never orders pizza any more because it always sucks. Mom had never ordered from here before, but I decided to try it any ways. We were both so pleasantly surprised at how beautiful and delicious the pizza was. I may not live here, but my mom does and she will definitely order from this place again. Try it.

So great for the health conscious people like us. The spring rolls was also good too. Some recommendations to the owners, change the layout of the menu please add some pictures as some people like to see what they are ordering. We knew what the items are however not everyone are like us. Also have some items for kids please. Some kid size portions of the main menu items would be great.

The Pho soups we had were very flavorful with their broth.  The meat provided in the soup was of high quality and plentiful.  Even the traditional sprouts and basil leaves were fresh.  The fried rolls were excellent and had good flavor.  Portion sizes of everything was truly excellent.  Probably the best of any Pho restaurant I've been to in memory.\n\nService was very friendly though there was a bit of a language barrier with communicating with the gentleman serving us.\n\nRestaurant and washrooms were clean and well maintained.\n\nThe biggest criticism I would have is that the Sriracha hot sauce was not actually the Rooster Brand (Huy Fong) that the bottles were, on the tables.  It appears they replaced the hot sauce in there with some inferior very watery (much less flavor) type of Chinese restaurant style hot sauce.  When mixed with the Housin sauce it did not result in great flavor at all.  For the love of flavor guys!  If you are a real Vietnamese Pho restaurant (with all other flavors on point) use the Huy Fong brand hot sauce in your restuarant!  I might consider bringing my own from home next time to dip the occaisonal meat item in.  :)\n\nI would definitely come back here and would recommend Pho Bo Ga Ottawa to others.

The pizza was ready right on time and still hot when I picked it up, which was fantastic.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something uniquely delightful and packed with flavor, I highly recommend Hearthstone Pizza for a takeout experience that goes above and beyond.

customers at this restaurant, but our last two experiences have been disappointing.\n\nDine-In: During our recent visit, the fish was not fresh, and our plates were dirty. We had to ask for clean ones, and even then, the waiter insisted they were fine until I wiped one with a tissue to show her the spot of dirt. The pickled ginger was inedible—very bitter—which affected the taste of the sushi pieces nearby. Surprisingly, they only addressed the ginger and not the inedible sushi! They also forgot one of the rolls we ordered, and when we inquired, the waitress claimed we hadn't asked for it.\n\nTakeout: We called around 8:30 PM, half an hour before closing, and were informed they would only accept cash since the cashier was closed. We ordered about $55 worth of food, which was ready in 15 minutes. However, except for one roll, the rest was awful. The fish tasted off and smelled really bad, and the pickled ginger was bitter again. We ended up throwing most of the food away. The few bites we had was enough to make us both feel sick. Tribble stomachache!\n\nThe next day, I spoke with the lady behind the counter about our experience. She seemed rushed and didn’t let me finish my explanation, offering a $5 discount coupon for our next visit. When I expressed my concerns about the quality of the fish, she dismissed them, saying, \""No, the fish is good here... okay, we’ll talk to the owner!\"" I tell you what, the owner is behind all of this to save cost!\n\nAs loyal customers who love supporting local businesses, we are disappointed.

and definitely will be back but most likely grabbing take out over dine in if coming on the weekend. Came here for the first time on Sat, Oct 20th for brunch at 11:15 AM, it was packed and we (2) put our name on the waiting list, it took about 45 mins to get a seat which was the only negative but we figured it must be good considering how busy it was so we waited. The seating is a bit too close for my preference to the point there is no privacy to have a conversation while you eat but I get they are likely trying to maximize the seating, it's also a pay up front before you order type of establishment so just keep that in mind. Not my favourite since I like to tip well but based off the service so in these pre pay scenarios I unfortunately just have to go 15% because I'm hoping it's going to be good, but I don't blame them with all the shady people these days doing dine and dash and etc.\n\nThat's where the complaints end, the food was absolutely amazing and the staff are very friendly and welcoming.

They require you to pay prior to being served and their system pops up for a tip of 15% or more, prior to having had any service. I voiced my frustration to the server and although she was understanding, this seems to be a growing trend among many small restaurants.\n\nI don't feel comfortable tipping without service first, and especially when ordering food first, you feel compelled to tip so the restaurant gives you good service.

I find this pretty disgusting and shouldn’t have customers sitting in the back recycling/ trash area."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNg2EmY09HpYOYp0h_X9SgkEoIzE6F1a6apmlk\u0026fid=0x0:0xaafa76a6be83bd15""],""When"":""2024-5-20""},{""Name"":""Madison G"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVtZsEld-Yz5a2Swm5LesjF83lo03ZXPGgujeQvQiLn6WLaIuGx=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""I really wish I could give this place more stars, but the experience me and my friends had here was a hectic one. First, we came on a Sunday around noon for brunch. Sundays are a very busy day, so we expected a waitlist which is totally fine. We waited about an hour for our table. There was so many people leaving, after an hour of not receiving a call we came in again to check how it was going, they apologized said that it was so hectic they were behind with calling the customers. When we finally ordered and sat down, it took quite a while to get our food. I ordered the chicken sandwich, and I was really disappointed when they put pickled peppers and onions on it when it never stated on the menu that it was on the burger. I didn’t bother saying anything because you could see the staff were already really struggling to keep up with all the orders. Second my two friends ordered the acai bowl, and one was completely forgotten all together. We had to go remind them that we never received an order. I do not blame the workers that day, if anything we really felt bad for how stressful everything was. From my understanding aswell is a lot of them were very new, and being new while working a Sunday ,plus understaffed is understandably very overwhelming. We even noticed they were accidently overcharging guests, and not being able to refund them due to the new machine system. One worker really stood out though; I believe her name was Lea. She was so kind and was going above and beyond to try and fix all the problems and issues that the restaurant was having. She was really trying her best and it was lovely interacting with her. She alone made our experience a lot better. The food we received itself was really well made and very delicious. ( Besides having the pickles peppers/onions on my sandwich ) But Like I said before, I had such high hopes for this place, unfortunately due to our experience and the stress it caused us , this place would not be our first choice to come back to. Overall, they need more staff on a Sunday, and better organization"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOmqPqRoJVr9_gx0TGti-1enX-R7IWzO0rr5NXI\u0026fid=0x0:0xaafa76a6be83bd15""],""When"":""2023-9-13""},{""Name"":""Janet"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUJLdrp4_-PzGWs8I7cbVIruptxWktGjE-_19gAKtYsnjV7T8DB=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Lovely little brunch place in Coquitlam, the staff is friendly and the place is clean, it is on the small side and at rush hour expect line ups.

They need to fry it longer so that it can sit in the sauce longer without getting soggy. Deep fried chicken wings were delicious and this is missing from the other chinese buffets. The chow mein and fried rice were lacking - not enough wok hei, so it was kinda soggy. Salt and hot pepper shrimp were ok.\n\nFor desserts they have the store bought mini strudels, two bite brownies, and some more, and also vanilla and chocolate ice cream. They need to work on their ice cream scoop hygiene cuz it sits in still water. They give fortune cookies with the bill but they were stale.\n\nThey have a promotion right now until Sept 12 - 10% off so original price of 23.95 becomes 21.56 which is on par with the other chinese buffets.

this one.  We went during happy hour for a friend's birthday as a table of four.  Even at the peak during our visit, the restaurant was at max, half full, but they did have a large reservation table of about twenty.  The food was good, but the service was SLOW.\nThey were clearly short-staffed, as the manager was working behind the bar while we were there, but we had to ask other servers to find our waitress twice and went up to the bar once to order our drinks because we had been waiting for so long.  That being said, they apologized profusely and comped us free desserts and did explain that they were short staffed. However, if you're offering a happy hour with one dollar oysters in a nice, reputable restaurant, then you should be prepared.\nWe ordered both off the happy hour menu and the regular menu and there was small tweaks. We would have made to each dish, but overall, a pretty satisfying meal.\nWe will give them another shot to see if the slow service was a one off.\nIf you park in the underground and register you license plate at the hotel desk, parking is free."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPzq5Fru9vEfYxmcJR5xpopeyv6MziJcBBPsKfk\u0026fid=0x0:0xcea729f7201067c9""],""When"":""2024-10-29""},{""Name"":""Olivia Ng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUIR4XKe445qsIhcDQSa4vWiOM9DrqY3ui4NVU5_YRxUleaadGk6w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I celebrated my husband's birthday at this restaurant during happy hour.

The Bulgogi eggs benedict was a hearty recommendation that hit the mark, though I might pair it with a side salad next time to balance things out.\nThe Americano was a bit watery for my taste, as I prefer a richer, more rounded brew, but the coffee they use is good, as evidenced by the delicious Affogato.

I am glad!!!! I see people order for take outs and some people even order everyday but from 7:15 to 9:30 on a Saturday, there were only 4 dine in tables including us, so they do not have extra servers, which is totally understandable… therefore if you are looking for services like cactus club, it’s not going to happen any time soon… nonetheless, I rate the service 10/10 for their friendliness and knowledge of the food, suggestions, the only reason why I give 4 star on google is because I want to stay true to what to expect for the next customers, atmosphere is 3/5 because it is a little dated but to some people this could be a 5/5.. nostalgic feeling!

Wedge Caesar salad was not appealing, insufficient dressing. Mixed grill seafood with zucchini and carrots: you can elevate this dish by using asparagus and baby carrots instead, and with a few microgreens garnish. Trust me, it’ll make a difference! We concluded our meal with coffee and dessert. Molten chocolate lava cake could’ve been better if there’s a garnish, just a piece of raspberry or blackberry or half strawberry, that would really make a big difference!

We sat at the patio, the server kept chasing us for ordering food. She came to chase us at least 3 times in about 5mins. No patience at all.\n\nWe have spent about $190 in total. The food portion was very small, especially the seafood tower and steak. The lobster tail was spongy, no taste, not fresh at all. Oyster and mussel were tiny. What’s worst was, all food came to the table almost at the same time. The table was full and we couldn’t enjoy the food one by one. The food was cold, not enjoyable at all.\n\nIt was a birthday celebration. I remarked it when I made the reservation online and reconfirmed again with a phone call. It was expecting to have a complementary desert to surprise my loved one but turned out nothing at the end. It made me very disappointed and upset. I totally regretted to choose this restaurant.\n\nAfter the dinner, I went to the disabled washroom with my little kids for more space. It was totally disgusting. The floor was wet, hand towel paper and toilet paper were on the floor. It was even worst than a public washroom at the park.\n\nI was not willing to pay the tips at all but still paid a bit. I cried out after the dinner and tried to find out the email address to express my feelings after the dinner. I then found out the cost of the kids meal should be $0.99 during Sep 2-30.

I've seen other reviewers unhappy with their food portion size too.\n\nMy wife was happy with her tuna salad portion size though. I would have been too.\n\nOther issues: We arrived about 4:40 PM and weren't sure if we just sit down ourselves or wait to be seated.

That’s where I think the let down was. Our appetizer plates were left on the table for at least ten minutes after we finished eating, and our entrees were placed on the table with the dirty dishes. I was asked if I wanted to keep my dirty cutlery, which was at this point on my appetizer plate in the server’s hand.

The taproom is located in a quiet place and pretty cozy itself. Once we arrived, there were only two other patrons, but the place got pretty busy by the time we left. It looks like they put a lot of time into porters and stouts, which I'm not into currently; however, I think they produce great products. I've read comments where people blame brewers for mixing unmixable, and quite honestly, I haven't tasted anything like that. I wasn't a big fan of some beers, which is absolutely normal, but I definitely can't tell that there was a bad or lousy brew. I thought Jamaican Pale Ale had a unique addition of spices, Gimme the Loot dark IPA was unexpected deliciousness, and BA Juicy Hazy was great. Also, if you have someone with you who is not into beers much, Christmas CREAM is a good choice for them.

Was pleasantly surprised to see a bowl that wasn't as big as Pho 99's large. Pho was good, soup was just right, neither too salty or too rich. Noodles came in a good amount. Meats in the House Special Pho left a lot to be desired though. Not as much as I'd expect, half a beef ball, about 2 slices of beef steak, 3 slices of beef flank, tiny bits of beef tendon (which was really soft and delicious to my surprise), and a few bits of tripe here and there. Kinda disappointed with the amount of meat but as it was still pretty delicious,  I'll overlook it.\nIt comes with tea, beansprouts, basil leaves and lime on the side.\nRefer to pictures for more information!\n\nPrice:\n$10.24++/person\n\nService:\nNothing special. The lady sounded angry but I guess it's just the way she speaks.\n\nWould I recommend?\nYes, go with family/small groups of friends as the place is rather small.
