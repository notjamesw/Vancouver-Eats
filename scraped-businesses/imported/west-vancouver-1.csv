Fish and Chips Experience!\n\nC-Lovers in Horseshoe Bay is an absolute gem for anyone craving the taste of traditional British-style fish and chips. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that feels both cozy and classic. The fish is always fresh, perfectly battered, and fried to golden perfection—crispy on the outside, tender and flaky on the inside. The chips are thick-cut, just the way they should be, and seasoned to perfection.\n\nOne of the highlights of C-Lovers is their generous portion sizes. Whether you're here for the classic cod, halibut, or even their other seafood options, you won't leave hungry. The tartar sauce is homemade and pairs wonderfully with the fish. I also appreciated the excellent customer service—friendly, efficient, and always with a smile.\n\nFor those looking to enjoy an authentic fish and chips experience with a beautiful view of Horseshoe Bay, C-Lovers is the place to go. It’s become my go-to spot for comfort food by the water.

Speaking of inconspicuous gems, the recentmost one that we stumbled upon is The Orchard Gleneagles Clubhouse.\n\nCradled by the Gleneagles Golf Course which itself is nestled on the pretty slopes by Larson Bay in West Vancouver, driving to this pretty location is a treat in itself! A local business which is \""run by locals, for locals\"", they do their very best to achieve their aim of \""creating a feeling of a holiday experience, offering something beautiful and immersive, with lots of fresh flowers and expansive outdoor spaces.\""\n\nAfter arriving at the beautiful venue, we entered the pretty, bustling restaurant having a warm and inviting ambiance with a cozy atmosphere. We were greeted by a combination of cheerful staff, pleasant music being played live by a local artist, and gorgeous water views from the indoor and outdoor seating areas! We chose to sit by the fire in the patio, and had the pleasure of sharing a table with friends for the entire evening.\n\nAfter a quick tour of the lobby and the aptly named Great Hall and dance floor (its almost 4000 sq. ft. being ideal for hosting weddings and banquets) at the Clubhouse, we grabbed a glass each of yummy refresher drinks, and settled into our comfy seats. What ensued was fun conversations interspersed with neatly plated delish appetizers and canapes being served by the crew of Aoife, Kat, Libby and Melissa. These kind and hard-working ladies sure did a lot of heavy-lifting for the evening!\n\nWe just couldn't get enough of the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken w/ Gochujang Sauce and Wild Mushroom Risotto, so ordered more of these along with the staff-recommended libations - Margarita and Mai Tai! Rest assured that we ended the evening with on a high with our hearts and tummies full! 🥂\n\nIf you are looking to go \""somewhere unique\"" for good food in Metro Vancouver, and/or catch \""some of the best views on the North Shore\"", especially when the weather is amazing, then The Clubhouse is the place for you. 5 stars and counting on all fronts, Team Orchard Gleneagles - thank you for having us, and we can't wait to return!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPANWq1laHC44NOEbnrCojadEYmweRwiCkFPu7G\u0026fid=0x0:0x4ee2212c5849f995""],""When"":""2024-3-30""},{""Name"":""Zane Erickson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUyuKKqkuzKUW-9qhJLQJt0mrgnRDbjpiqRvzzVywhPy_mBE3VuhQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""At The Orchard Gleneagles Clubhouse restaurant, I indulged in the baked onion soup and the beef dip sandwich.

My entree, the sablefish was nicely done, but the sides were under seasoned and not the best. The asparagus especially was super tough.

I was expecting a rich, creamy clam chowder, but the taste was just okay and didn't quite meet my expectations.\n\nOne thing that caught me off guard was the $7 charge for the bread basket.

The view from this restaurant is breathtaking and it would be challenging indeed to find another restaurant with comparable views to the ones found at Salmon House on the Hill.\n\nFeatured here:\nSalmon House Seafood Chowder\nSalmon House Sampler\nAlder Grilled Salmon Trio\nDark Chocolate Lava Cake\nAffogato\n\nDid I mention how great the view is from this place? The food here is way overpriced so it's really the view that you're paying for when you come here.\n\nThe Seafood Chowder was a very tasty soup but really not our idea of a chowder. Chowders are usually thicker whereas this consisted of a thin, light broth. It was a wonderful soup and the light broth was perhaps better for our stomachs than a typical chowder would have been. Just that it didn't quite fit our concept of a chowder.\n\nSome of us found the salmon to be a bit overcooked. The restaurant was good enough to have the kitchen cook another order of it for one of us (only one of us dared to complain about it), and they didn't charge us for the first order. The second one was an improvement, but could have still been a bit more moist.\n\nOne person in our group who has a nut allergy began to have a bit of an allergic reaction to something he ate. After consulting with our server who then went and checked with the kitchen it was discovered that pecans had been used to make a sauce that had been on top of his food. The restaurant apologized and didn't charge us for this dish either.\n\nIt's really quite surprising that they didn't think to list the pecans on their menu. When so many people in the world have nut allergies, it should be standard procedure for any restaurant that uses nuts, to list those nuts on the menu. This would enable customers with nut allergies to make more informed decisions when choosing what they'd like to order from the menu.\n\nOh, and the Dark Chocolate Lava Cake wasn't very Lava-ish. Having already deducted two entrees from our bill though, we weren't about to go and make a fuss about the Lava Cake.\n\nService: Good\nParking: Plentiful and free\nLocation: 2229 Folkestone Way, West Vancouver, BC"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNNMUgslD8v3Wwzgp2HL2I9PRvWIkwAUmkhazko\u0026fid=0x0:0x5aae5c7f78f58e0""],""When"":""2024-6-18""},{""Name"":""Joanna Yang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWo3CUdy70AYCLA_JiRqJIn6ZW8IfTtpsEncXt2po_QrN_S4wuPVg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It's been years since we've eaten dinner here, went here for Valentine's dinner.

It’s located along the newer strip of restaurants on Ambleside overlooking the beach. There are both  pay and free parking along the surrounding streets.\n\nInside has that modern contemporary look and layout. There are both tables and booth seats available. A cross between a casual and semi formal atmosphere.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Classic Caesar \u0026 flor de fresa. The drinks were okay, on the lighter side taste wise.\n2. Complimentary bread with pumpkin spread. Fresh and warm, the pumpkin spread was tasty.\n3. 1/2 dozen premium fresh oysters. Very fresh with a rich flavour.\n4. Bluefin tuna tataki. It was okay but hardy notice the bluefin flavour.\n5. Lobster maki roll. A little disappointed on this one. The lobster taste and texture were near nonexistent. And the rice was over pressed, lost its texture.\n6. Hamachi, bluefin, uni nigiris. The portion was very generous but the sushi rice needed some proper seasoning.\n7. Yuca soup. It was hot and I quite enjoyed it.\n8. Large mussels. I don’t know about large but they were good size.\n9. Octopus anticucho. The Smokey flavour and aroma is okay but the texture wasn’t, it was like chewing on rubber.\n10. 10oz ribeye. Taste wise it was okay but it was too dry and plain to satisfy my tastebuds.\n11. Complimentary little desserts.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was quite causal, I can see it being busy during the warmer weathers especially when it’s by the beach and tourist area.\n\nThe service was okay but could be a bit more attentive by the staffs especially when there were less than a handful of table of customers.\n\nAs for the food, the quality overall fell a bit short for the price. I definitely think it needs to bring a notch up to retain the repeats of the locals. after all, locals will not just pay a higher price because it’s by the waterfront…"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPaVX21BEdcfLJ8nfSIW1bkwhifm3IkbxgwdKXf\u0026fid=0x0:0x3c4ebe2b6013a07d""],""When"":""2024-6-6""},{""Name"":""Ali Taheri"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUE3PxD7u8hAuIIfsHPwY3qF1Vf2akitCmCQsH6To47GSdPMek=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""It is hard to rate this restaurant, on one hand its beautiful, great location by the sea, great service and great music, on the other hand very mid food, taste wise just not matching the price and freshness is a hit or miss, loved the yucas bravas though.

She surprised us with two birthday desserts for our table which was so kind and is something that restaurants never do anymore. There was a guest experience lady who came and hand delivered my brother a birthday card too. Nothing beats a hand written card! The bus boy who was helping her was great too. He noticed a glass was dirty when we sat down and he discreetly replaced it before we even asked and immediately filled our waters throughout the night. Food and drinks were excellent. Earls has really worked on its food quality and presentation and it is so much better than it was when I used to work there! You can tell lots of love goes into the food.

Not too chewy either\n\nPrawns appetizer (22) - cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Could do with a little more vegetable\n\nLinguine vongole (26) - tasted like the sea.

I decided to experience the hype for myself during a visit to the area. Upon arrival, I was informed of a 20-30 minute wait, which I opted to endure given the time I had to spare. Unfortunately, what awaited me fell far short of expectations.\n\nFood\n\nKorean Bulgogi Benny\nThis dish, consisting of Korean-style shaved inside-round beef, peperonata, eggs, and waffle fries served atop a butter croissant, had potential on paper. The beef itself was tender and well-seasoned, offering a pleasant balance of sweetness and savory flavors. However, the dish faltered with its execution. Both the croissant and the waffle fries were served cold, which significantly detracted from the overall experience. For a dish priced at a premium, the lack of attention to basic temperature standards was disappointing.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nBreakfast Tacos\nThe breakfast tacos were, regrettably, forgettable. While competently assembled, they lacked the bold flavors or unique twists that would set them apart. The result was a dish that felt more like a generic offering than a signature item on the menu.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nDrinks\n\nVanilla Latte and Pomegranate Nojito\nThe drinks provided a rare bright spot in an otherwise lackluster meal. The vanilla latte was rich and well-balanced, while the pomegranate Nojito was refreshing and thoughtfully prepared. These beverages stood out as the most enjoyable aspect of my visit.\n\nService\n\nService is often the backbone of a memorable dining experience, yet this was where OEB Ambleside faltered the most. The server was inattentive, failing to engage or follow up after delivering the dishes. Basic courtesies, such as checking in on the table or ensuring drinks arrived in a timely manner, were conspicuously absent. The lack of professionalism was glaring and left much to be desired.\n\nRating: 1/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nThe restaurant’s atmosphere was lively, but not in a way that enhanced the experience. The space was overly crowded, and the noise level made conversation difficult. Furthermore, the pacing of service was poorly managed; drinks took 15 minutes to arrive, while the food followed almost immediately afterward, disrupting the flow of the meal.\n\nRating: 2/10\n\nPrice\n\nFor a restaurant with high pricing, the quality and execution did not justify the cost. The cold dishes, small portions, and lack of attention to detail made the experience feel overpriced and underwhelming.\n\nVerdict\n\nOEB Ambleside may attract crowds, but my visit left me questioning the source of its popularity. While the drinks were enjoyable and the menu concept intriguing, the execution was lacking in nearly every other aspect. Poor service, subpar food quality, and an overcrowded ambiance overshadowed the positives. For those considering a visit, temper your expectations."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOWWN_dRBn3Y92xVmQPN51-hUkiHuJahtvmPUAG\u0026fid=0x0:0x9408b85a90ea9ed4""],""When"":""2024-12-10""},{""Name"":""shabnam naghibi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXd6csLq_Plgoil1-oRcblVIUe4ZOew5Yy14HIazDukVO-9IIeH=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I recently visited this charming breakfast place and had a delightful experience.

me off more than disappointment? Laziness.\n\nTheir menu states they serve Persian \""Sangak\"" bread. They don't.\nWhat is irritatingly stupefying here is that there is a Persian Bakery right across the street from them.\n\nWith their approximately 10 seater dining table and 5 staff on hand someone could've done what?.....Yes!...jumped across the street to the bakery and stocked up on the bread they promised the customer on their menu before opening....Or am I just crazy?\n\nWell...I guess if they had done that....they wouldn't have had the time to giggle about it in the back like little school girls. Moving on......\n\nThe French Toast -\nUndercooked \u0026 doughy in the middle. Way too bare and unimpressively lacking in presentation. I mean you're paying for these dishes. I've had my 10 year old nephew make better French Toast.\nThe bacon was tasty and the coffee was decent....even came in a cute little cup.\nSo, that's something....\n\nBreakfast Burrito -\nGood for an appetizer...Oh wait...it was an entree dish....enough said.\n\nFancy Benedict -\nNo, it wasn't fancy...that's the name of the dish ironically.\nIt was cold, the salmon lacking and clearly someone's first attempt at making a Benny.\n\nThe Service -\nWe had to ask for everything. There was an underlying impatience with our server....like we were keeping her from something. Finally someone else came by with more coffee.\nNot the end of the world, but not charming either.\n\nThis place reminded me of a first year medical student trying to do brain surgery. Education, Experience, Commitment.\n\nThen open your doors."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP-Z1C-tnmDGAG10MaGkQs4rOiEK5_KAz_rS1Rf\u0026fid=0x0:0xc99d1e2476cd846e""],""When"":""2024-11-25""},{""Name"":""Dave DeBruine"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXYEhm1DgVq7TLPB11i7kNy_W29mRC4vLw57yvxEspzN-KFZg54=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Fantastic brunch!

The Szechuan dish was another disappointment – it was overcooked and lacked the balance of flavors I was hoping for.\n\nThe only part of my meal that stood out in a positive way were the yam fries, which were crispy and well-seasoned.

This older french restaurant we had hoped would be a hidden gem, however it turned out to be a place that I wished I hadn’t found. The server was nice lady with a warm welcome, but then everything goes downhill from there.\n\nThe French onion soup had barely any cheese or onion. It was more a beef broth soup with a soggy bread. When I asked if they forgot the cheese, they replied it had “sunk” into the soup. I dug around for it and maybe found a few strands of cheese, far from what a French onion soup is supposed to be. I also barely saw any onion as well but figured I’d let it go.\n\nI selected the feature filet mignon with two lamb rack. When I inquired about the price, I was informed it was $55 and comes with a 6oz filet mignon. When it arrived, the piece of meat on one lamb rack looked bigger than the ‘6oz’ steak. I couldn’t help but inquired about this and ended up being told the “combined protein” in this dish was 6oz ?! My jaw dropped but again, I let it go. I cut into my “medium rare” steak and it was fully well done. This was the same with the lamb chops. I didn’t even bother taking a bite and informed them of this and they offered to cook another. When that one came, it was less cooked but nothing like I would expect of a steak. There’s no crust to it and the middle was rare, but working with the approximately 3oz steak I can see the difficulty. Then it came to the taste. Aside it from being drenched in a mediocre sauce, there was a taste of lighter fluid/gas in the steak. I let my wife try without telling her what I tasted and she said the exact same thing, so it wasn’t just me. I told the server this and she just said, maybe you just have a high expectation of your steaks. For the price, I expect a decent quality steak. I couldn’t continue eating it and send it back. I didn’t bother getting another dish. I also had a stomachache after leaving the restaurant.\n\nFor the icing on top, they also charged me GST during this “tax holiday”."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMc_z_kjlis7eAxcJ7JYghohOxpYbWAyumgGT8m\u0026fid=0x0:0x80cdaee2b2061376""],""When"":""2024-12-22""},{""Name"":""Michael Lu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6Dues4lMouQFf0TD1AVB3rVU486mPjYa_0gGjgPuPqvX-mrEU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Tldr - the lamb is absolutely excellent, melts in your mouth. Recommend focusing on the main course, apps (at least lobster bisque and escargot) are skippable.\n\nChez Michel got a chic vibe and doesn't feel pretentious. This resto has a traditional style of French cuisine and it certainly takes you to another setting for this dining experience. Kelly is our waitress and she was considerate in bringing in the right items to complement our dishes (i.e. bringing in bread when we had extra lobster bisque left).\n\nWe ordered the éscargot and lobster bisque for apps, both were good but not amazing.\n\nFor mains, we got the poulet de vent and the lamb/beef special. The former dish had a puffy pastry that went extremely well with the chicken, and the lamb melted in our mouths.\n\nWill definitely recommend those looking for traditional French food visit this place if you're here for something else.

celebrate a friend’s birthday that enjoys karaoke. We took the bus over as it was only a 10 minute bus ride and ubered back home since we would be drinking.\n\nThis was our second karaoke night here as we had such fun the first time. There is an interesting bunch of regulars that come here to karaoke. We saw a few of the same regulars from the last time.\n\nThere is a ground level bar and tables and you walk downstairs to the karaoke section. They have a large binder with songs arranged by artist or song title. You write your song and name on a little piece of paper and hand it to the DJ.\n\nSeveral women in our group sang Take It Easy (Eagles) and It’s Too Late (Carole King) and as a group while another guy sang the Brady Bunch theme. 2 other girls in our group did a Taylor Swift song I think.\n\nThey have several good beers in tap, wine and other drinks. I had 2 pints of Parallel 49’s Tricycle. It is a Grapefruit Radler so a good summer beer that is under 5%. I ordered the house red wine but received the house white wine but she was ok with that as she also likes white wine and did not want me to return it. So it worked out. Others had one of the draft beers or wine as well.\n\nIt’s a lot of fun and worth going to! There’s really good and not so good singers but the audience is very supportive of anyone that gets up to sing. You don’t have time get up and sing but you can sing along as you’ll likely recognize many of the songs. They also have live music and sports games on too.

Despite feeling satiated, the exquisite flavors convinced us to savor the scampi as well, leaving only a small portion of the dip untouched.\n\nDespite the current review score of 3.7, I respectfully disagree and would confidently give it a perfect five.\nHere's why:\n1. The menu offered a diverse selection that you wouldn't find at your typical Canadian restaurants.\n2. The taste and freshness exceeded our expectations.\n3. The warmth and hospitality of the staff contributed to a delightful dining experience.\n4. The spacious layout and friendly ambiance added to the overall enjoyment.\n5.

Their seasonal Fall - Winter Roast Prime Rib is absolutely juicy,  delicious and perfectly cooked. The  Portobello Mushroom Chicken is also amazingly tasty served over pasta and with  vegetables. For dessert, the famous Key Lime Pie is awesome and not to be passed over.\n\nThis particular time, I went for their California Burger with Side-Caesar Salad, Long Island Ice Tea (2x), followed by White Chocolate Cheesecake (Key Lime Pie was sold-out!), and Latte.\n\nMilestones is always great for its upbeat urban feel, later closing time (11pm), very friendly people -- e.g., bartenders who know how to mix and happily research requested drinks  -- and its broad and delicous menu offerings.

The space feels a bit dated and could benefit from a refresh to match the quality of the food.\nDespite this, the delicious flavors and attentive service more than made up for the less-than-ideal atmosphere.\n\nIf you’re looking for amazing Thai food, Thai Pudding is definitely worth a visit—just don’t expect the most modern setting.\nI’ll definitely be back for the food!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOa6J_Fi0mRXzsoO_f7UPz-MRThcAPzvHaHwv3z\u0026fid=0x0:0xefc5132cc61b9728""],""When"":""2024-12-23""},{""Name"":""Law Rence H"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWX-gD_1eapEh74OqyTe0YNfW1L_Xu19R2dfxMN8tNFSt7HowTh1A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Thai Pudpong is a gem in West Vancouver!

The spice levels can be adjusted to your preference, which is great for those who like it mild or extra spicy.\nThe staff are attentive and frequently top up water glasses without being intrusive.

In contrast, this is a take-out only venue, you would never eat in.\nDuring the ordering process, I encountered rudeness and unprofessionalism from the owner. When I needed to change the size of a pizza, the response was belittling and condescending, which was more than distressing, especially since it was my birthday. Despite this, I proceeded with the order, prioritizing the needs of my family.\nUpon arrival to pick up our order, my husband was initially ignored by the staff, adding to the negative experience.\nAs for the food, the pizzas were horrible. They lacked flavor and had a cardboard-like texture, making them terrible value for the price of $108.00. Frankly, even frozen pizzas would have been a better option.\nBased on this experience, I cannot recommend this establishment. The service was unwelcoming, and the quality of the pizza was subpar.

Our server was polite and took the time to explain each dish, the menu options, and even shared stories about the regions near Tibet where they source their unique spices. The handmade pasta was thick and flavorful—nothing like the ones you'd find in a supermarket.\n\nOne of my favorite dishes was the \""bread with shredded pork\"" (see the pic). Sorry for not remembering the exact name, but it was absolutely delicious! Even the washrooms were clean, which is always a plus in my book.\n\nMy only complaint is that it's a bit far from Richmond (the Asian hub in vancouver metropolitan region).

(And this is without fries!)\n\nIt wasn't bad per se but it wasn't fantastic either. It was just okay. It seemed to lack fresh flavours and you can see from the photo there's no lettuce. The flavours of their mayo sauce and fried onions with the bacon and cheese all kind of blended together and lacked any contrast. The buns weren't anything special either. Even if they didn't add any fresh ingredients like shredded cabbage or carrot, what would've helped is if they charred the beef patties a bit and properly caramelize the onions to give the burger a more diverse flavour profile.\n\nPrevious visits, I don't think I was this disappointed.

went to get a Burrito at the Park Royal location. What I experienced was disturbing and probably in violation of health and safety standards.\n\nThe entire seating area was filthy. There wasn't one seating area that wasn't dirty with the food from previous customers or an area of the floor that wasn't covered with litter or liquid. I've attached some pics to show what I mean, but it doesn't convey the state of your restaurant. Incidentally, the same was the case for the prep area.\n\nWhen I asked the staff to clean a table, they seemed confused at first. Then one of the women finally went to the side and took a dirty cloth out of a bucket and came over and wiped one table for me without using any cleaning agent. She left every other table dirty.\n\nThen one of your male staff (he is in one of the pictures) came back in with another male colleague and they went to wash their hands. The guy literally took a few drops of water on his fingers, shook his hand and then proceeded to go to work touching food. Later, he was standing by the cash picking his teeth with his fingers.\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that restaurants were bending over backwards to keep their locations sparkling clean because of COVID. Please take steps to implement frequent cleaning protocols in your restaurant. It isn't like staff don't have time. There were 5 staff standing around that could have easily taken a few minutes to wipe down the tables and chairs with a cleaning agent, pick up garbage and sweep the floors.\n\nIncidentally, the burrito was cold, so not much to say for the food either."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMvU8C-wwP0ZvyIE5V5jfqN2ULUB3P1FVFDD6VF\u0026fid=0x0:0xc5b0abb112d4e477""],""When"":""2024-12-21""},{""Name"":""Gagandeep Uppal"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWW-KFilY4MzRYsjqlFmsRdCYxENNjInGnFlFIZDtV91hxduzc=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I ordered catering for 35 people and had the worst experience.

That’s a lot of mustard and it was the most expensive item on our bill.\n\nTried it once, might be back for the pizzas."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM_-fopMcPY0D5bwd3qju4AtL52NESUiVm2dzUi\u0026fid=0x0:0xfbeed74e969f0fa8""],""When"":""2024-6-28""},{""Name"":""Peter Nieforth"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFYmOXJ8rGzzp0jmovSkI_rGcSmBvoAf5ws5UTBWNMEQBysRSf=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Wow finally got into Fred's...finally summer hours have kicked in and the kitchen closes at 10 pm!

The quality of the crust was far beyond anything I have experienced anywhere in North America. (And rivalling Italy, who would have thought?!) And Sam who runs the front has the customer service skills of a hotel manager at the four seasons. Five stars just isn't enough.

The manager came out specially to discuss my dietary needs and between himself and the chef they put together a delicious pasta for me.\nWe enjoyed two bottles of Italian red when my daughter and her boyfriend joined us and each one of our meals was superb.\nThe atmosphere was upbeat and the restaurant was busy until at least 11pm when we took our leave.\nI would highly recommend Bar Olo for a night out."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMbpWPkEX_foAdcuNEnN25jxBxwoAvIjFQ1Go4w\u0026fid=0x0:0x7d8db78023fbfd73""],""When"":""2023-8-4""},{""Name"":""Christine Yoo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK9asSL1PLT42mamAsAYYvtxDzl7YBgfoxmp66SUBnHKE1VvQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing experience at Bar Olo!

While the cafe was bustling with customers, mostly older patrons, we found that the food didn’t quite hit the mark for us. The flavors were rather bland, and we struggled to finish our meals.

My visit lived up to the high expectations, delivering a memorable indulgence.\n\nDrinks\n\nCafé Mocha\nThe café mocha struck a pleasant balance between its rich chocolate base and smooth coffee undertones. While the flavors were well-blended, the drink lacked the robust intensity that might have made it truly exceptional.\n\nCappuccino\nSimilarly, the cappuccino was well-executed, with a creamy froth and a balanced coffee profile. Though enjoyable, it didn’t possess the boldness of flavor that would elevate it to greatness.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nPastries and Desserts\n\nHazelnut Chocolate Danish\nThis pastry was a testament to Thierry’s mastery of texture and flavor. The buttery, golden-brown layers were perfectly crisp, providing a delightful contrast to the creamy hazelnut filling. The addition of hazelnut chocolate ganache and candied hazelnuts added richness and depth, making each bite a harmonious blend of crunch and sweetness.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nChocolate Marquise\nThe chocolate marquise was the epitome of indulgence. Layers of hazelnut dacquoise, salted caramel, crisp praline, and silky chocolate mousse created a symphony of textures and flavors. This dessert was impeccably balanced, with the salted caramel cutting through the richness of the chocolate to leave a lasting impression.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nService\n\nThe service at Thierry Ambleside was impeccable. The staff were warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. From the initial greeting to the prompt delivery of drinks and pastries, their professionalism added to the overall experience.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nAmbiance\n\nThierry’s interior is a perfect blend of modern sophistication and comfort. The clean, well-maintained space offers a serene environment complemented by scenic views, making it an ideal spot for a leisurely treat. The seating is thoughtfully arranged, and the overall atmosphere is inviting and relaxed.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nPrice\n\nGiven the exceptional quality of the pastries, desserts, and beverages, the pricing feels entirely justified. Thierry offers an experience that goes beyond mere sustenance, delivering artistry and flavor that are worth every penny.\n\nVerdict\n\nThierry Ambleside stands as a shining example of excellence in the patisserie world. From its expertly crafted pastries to its refined ambiance, the café delivers on all fronts. It’s a must-visit destination for dessert enthusiasts and anyone seeking a sophisticated café experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOyO1FSPGoK54hbKcNhGYx--04EHRdQ4kJBgKWV\u0026fid=0x0:0x70a7d0a2b9d10ac4""],""When"":""2024-12-10""},{""Name"":""Mark V.

These overall dark/wood + neutral tones are offset by red leather sofas and a focal floral arrangement on a curving wood + marble table.\n\nThe interior radiates a bright welcoming  sophistication. The staff are friendly and courteous, and the Cafe ambiance is polite and conversational. Exterior seating under heat lamps and behind wrought-iron railings is also available along the Bellevue Avenue front.\n\nThierry offers a wide array of rich French pastries, cakes and biscuits -- in addition to hand-made confections + chocolates. Breakfast and Lunch menus are available at Thierry which is also licensed, serving select wines, beers and liqueurs.\n\nThierry at Grosvenor Ambleside is definitely a scenic + sophisticated destination for a satisfyingly delectable collation at any time of day."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN6C4f0EOi5V43e0nylmP4Id93O2oztZhz7TTQX\u0026fid=0x0:0x70a7d0a2b9d10ac4""],""When"":""2024-10-15""},{""Name"":""William Lau"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVmQdctlbM12t5Occdf84xI_X4OatAdUnoO7Mf5nuujaBWYasmgPA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best location of Alberni and Mount Pleasant, room-Wise as it seems to be the largest location.\n\nDesserts were plentiful but not much pastry selection this afternoon.\n\nPrices are the usual expensive Thierry but are not most popular coffee places these days?\n\nNote: all Americano sizes are 2 shots only.

When I expressed shock at the cost for the small portion size and the barely-there halloumi, the server went to speak with various people and then said that was the add-on price. I didn’t even bother trying the food but simply requested a refund. I guess I would have been better to order a salad with halloumi already on, but the portion sizes are still too small to be considered lunch or a meal.

The menu was also re-worked, so they now serve bistro-level dishes (again, compared to fast-food style in the past). The service is always quick and friendly. My kids love learning about the Lodge history through reading their articles hung on walls and checking out original artifacts.\nI would recommend Hollyburn Lodge as a perfect dating destination for young couples who want to spend their date outdoors, say snowshoeing Lights to the Lodge trail.

Roll\n\nThe ingredients here are always very fresh and top notch. The Popeye Roll is a Vegetarian roll and this was our first time trying it. I loved this roll and would happily eat it again! The Inari in this roll gave it a subtle sweetness without being excessively sweet. One of the most delightful Vegetarian sushi rolls I've ever had!\n\nBene Sushi never ceases to impress me with their Avocado Roll. It's one of the simplest rolls you could order from a Japanese restaurant, but they do it sooo well at this restaurant. The avocado is always a lovely green colour, without a hint of brown in it. Plus the roll is always packed with huge chunks of the avocado and not too much rice surrounding the avocado.\n\nPsst...not featured here, but we tried the Unagi Flame Roll on a previous visit and it was spectacular! I do recommend giving it a try!\n\nService: Good\nParking: Free covered parking at the back of the restaurant\nLocation: 1574 Marine Dr., West Vancouver, BC"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOCpO6yP6eBVAucPFWGF9UzdtEgeRdnK0SshjEn\u0026fid=0x0:0xf80bdb50daa294bc""],""When"":""2024-5-24""},{""Name"":""Amin Sameni"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVu7gOTJPCM-cxMdKwmmGT2dzn1GqI9KyFBzJ01UvZjTN1ONfqq=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Nice location with good atmosphere\nSushi was good, in good portionsand reasonable price\nService was just okay"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOdS2bOBK6wh8zOAdvrt4bk87fMxUHjLKnO4db6\u0026fid=0x0:0xf80bdb50daa294bc""],""When"":""2024-6-24""},{""Name"":""Ferial Fahim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUgwqxNvBQbJPV5Tl-uzRHmdKej1Bp0eSdLVDKXycTsty1bBtRl=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The menu boasted an impressive variety of sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiri options.

Opa is one of the more expensive options at the mall, so when I go, I’m treating myself.\nAs another disappointed customer has already said in these reviews, this location CONSISTENTLY, left me unhappy with my experience or food. I don’t think I’ve ever come to this location and was happy with the outcome.\nI usually order the opa platter, with chicken and Caesar and I ask to pay for 3 extra tzatziki dips. They usually don’t give me all the dips, after I pay for them (sometimes they charge me, sometimes they don’t) and then when I ask them, they act like I’m stealing from them or as if it wasn’t something I literally paid for. Another time they gave me Greek salad, and I let them know, and then they just chucked everything in the container and put it on the counter without giving me utensils, and again, acted like I was inconveniencing them.\n\nThe picture shown here, shows an Olympus bowl that I paid 9 dollars for… I got two scoops of rice, and maybe 10 chunks of tomato, jalapeño and onion. 9 dollars… really? Again he just chucked it all in the bowl as you can see, asked if it was to go, I said yes. He puts the lid on and gets it all saucy, gives me a knife and then I ask if it comes with tzatziki (which I know it does) and then he fills the cup maybe a quarter of the way and throws it on the counter.\n\nI don’t want to spend half my break waiting in line, waiting for it to get thrown in the container, to spend 10 dollars or more for this quality of food or service.\nYou guys have one woman working here who you can tell she’s trying her best to make things better and the rest are a bunch of meat heads that could care less.\n\nAs a store manager myself, I’d be ashamed to have this team representing my company."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOzNsmqArkMCrkqSIJ3U2yzJZX_AaqbUiD3axhh\u0026fid=0x0:0xc674e91aae9ea939""],""When"":""2021-7-6""},{""Name"":""Fuck You"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI3vrxkuPs6BZeEKGbfmnmUUimC6lf3QYX8kcEpC1mTHZE5wA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""The only tasty thing was the chicken souvlaki and there was only one stick.

The ordering counter is downstairs with a seating area upstairs. It wasn't particularly clean: some tables had crumbs and there was trash on the floor under some tables, which weirdly is carpeted. The furniture, however, is in good condition and comfortable.\nFIRST VISIT: I had a felafel plate and a rice pudding. The food was average quality. The sauces they use are a little different than the typical sauces: the white sauce was thicker and tangier and the red sauce had a hint of heat but mostly tasted like a zestier and thinner version of ketchup (this is maybe not the most appealing way of describing it - it was good, like a cross between hot sauce and ketchup). I liked the different flavours and the rice was actually pretty good, but I was indifferent about the felafel and hummus. The felafels were like the puck-shaped ones you can buy at the grocery store. The rice pudding had a nice flavour but was almost gelatinous in consistency, which I can't decide how I feel about.\nSecond visit: I wanted to see if the more distinctly Persian dishes would be better, so I tried the eggplant stew, the one veg stew on the menu. The “broth” that the eggplant and tomato were stewed in was straight oil, which I did not like. Again the rice was great, but they give so much with the stew that I didn’t know what to do with it all.\nThe prices ($17 for the plate and stew w/ rice, $5 for the rice pudding) are fair for the amount of food you get, which is pretty generous. I finished the whole felafel plate but was very hungry, so if you have a smaller appetite you will have leftovers. Two people could easily split a rice pudding.\nThe staff seems very nice, but I just can’t see myself coming back for the food. I’d get the felafel again if it was the ONLY place to get felafel in town, but it is very much not."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNY72ngJ2ZaAwXFb3jb_xOhzFGMNLItp0KiPLjO\u0026fid=0x0:0x615e3b717137617d""],""When"":""2024-1-12""},{""Name"":""Abdullah K"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVaOLs3U1NGAh-EH96OS0WG3dhkXXnjYtovUMs7UYINOdg16mA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is my go-to place to eat on and around campus!

I’m salivating a day later writing this review thinking about how beautifully curated each dish was designed. Chef Chow is a total artist and a master of his craft. A few musts include the Tuna Tartar, Oyster Motoyaki, Beet and Burrata salad, duck, the scallops OMG, sable fish… DOUBLE OMG and an array of desserts that the pastry team had skillfully curated to reflect British Columbia’s nature and environment.\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts- HUGE thanks to the entire team for the special hospitality and delicacies. You all truly outdid yourselves.\n\nThank you!!\nRiley and Anna"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM8Z8XjNkHyhAvJM342-p_KpqBWYsIkY1rwLmYe\u0026fid=0x0:0x2990e8c80679c2f1""],""When"":""2024-10-20""},{""Name"":""T"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWuLCrwKa9NLpGvoI7KXeamb10EWAoAmRoPxgdu96hyYHG6mtPkhg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Came the other day as a solo diner for lunch.

Very warm atmosphere, from the design of the inside to the friendly service. Because the place is relatively small, it’s probably not a good idea to bring a large group, but it’s a nice place for a smaller hang or even to chill by yourself. I have been curious for a while and just tried it with some friends. I probably will be back.\nThey have a great drink menu with lots of specialty cocktails and nonalcoholic drinks. I got a nonalcoholic pineapple guava soda. I don’t like drinks that are too sweet and this was good for me, but some people might find it weak compared to commercial fruit sodas.\nI got a soup and sandwich combo as my entree with the Eggplant Caprese sandwich and the Crab Bisque. I really liked this take on a caprese sandwich, and the baguette was very fresh and soft. The bisque was very good too. Rather than being a super creamy bisque, this was more tomato-based and a little tangy. Good flavour with a fair amount of crab meat. I also liked the little side of coleslaw that was included in the combo.\nWasn’t really planning on getting dessert but then I saw they had a Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding, and I will rarely pass up on bread pudding. It was delicious but, as you might expect from bread pudding made of banana bread, with ice cream, with caramel sauce, VERY rich and heavy, and I had to get some help to finish it. I think this would be ideal for splitting between two people.\nFor this meal, with tip, I paid $48, which surprised me. I thought it was a good meal, but not $50 good - I’d associate that kind of price with a more upscale experience than this. I can understand the soup and sandwich pricing, the dessert was a little expensive, but what really strikes me as obviously overpriced would be the $8 soda. I understand it’s made in house, but it was just a fruity soda - no fruit bits or anything fancy, and no alcohol. It was a nice refreshing drink, but for $8 I wouldn’t say it was worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMA-33yhxlhuJWzrEmE3NBivENZ-qwhvFcoFjxN\u0026fid=0x0:0x57c0ba4874667b57""],""When"":""2023-5-20""},{""Name"":""Keith Ver"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXVdqxLCf1LEt0AU82myo-eUqDcb2LcbdnfhupJTEW0sPAQ-qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Good food and good service!

for a restaurant with an incredible ocean view? Look no further!\n\n•Service: we ordered at the window since we wanted to sit and eat on the beach. The girl who took our order was very friendly! Our food didn’t take long, maybe 8-10mins.\n\n•Chicken Burger with Fries, 3.5/5: I’m sad they don’t make the chicken burger they used to, it was a 5/5! The new burger’s served on a soft brioche bun, chicken was nicely cooked, lightly seasoned and deep fried. Coleslaw on the burger was a nice touch, it gave me pulled pork sandwich vibes. Unfortunately, as you can see in the photo, this seriously lacked BBQ sauce, or I would’ve given this a higher rating. I’d still recommend trying this burger, just ask for extra sauce. *Boat Shed, if you’re listening, please bring back the old chicken burger, it was outstanding!\n\n•Cod Burger 3.75/5: there’s nothing quite like eating fish and chips by the sea! Again, what’s with the lack of sauce? Also served on a fresh brioche bun, we got a generous piece of cod, which was cooked to perfection! The batter’s thick and well-seasoned. Once again, coleslaw’s a nice touch, especially on this burger. You’ll want to eat this fairly quickly, between the soft bun, coleslaw, pickle and battered fish, it can get a bit soggy. I wish there was more tartar sauce, I would’ve given 4/5, but I still highly recommend this, just ask for extra sauce. My friend and I agreed this was the better burger of the two!\n\n•Parmesan Truffle Fries with Garlic Aioli, 2.75/5: truffle isn’t my favorite, but my friend loves it, so I tried a couple. We agreed that given the mild truffle flavor and sprinkle of Parmesan, these didn’t justify the $4 upgrade. *Side note, my friend said they’d get Garlic Aioli as a dip for the regular fries, it was good.\n\n•Regular Fries, 5/5: delicious! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, served piping hot. The fries alone make me want to come back!\n\nOverall: Burgers cost $20 and come with French Fries, or upgrade to Yam or Parmesan Truffle Fries for an additional $4. Portions are generous, depending how hungry you are, two people could share a burger and fries. After these tasty meals today, (minus the sauce issue, which I know to ask for extra next time), I’d return to try other things!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM3Y7axcqJYk4_N7QRJYRcj8o3iJaNYnHBjuP1Y\u0026fid=0x0:0x68a5abf78bd85733""],""When"":""2024-7-23""},{""Name"":""Selena Di"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpeYx0Hy_h2KTOyIkW4-1JaPj6jgnO27OxLHg2-s4kfI5B0x9Tqg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Enjoyed a lovely evening there with great food and a beautiful sunset!

Sitting varies from cafe tables, to Howarts style long tables or high-chair tables found in coffee shops. The food-serving area of the dinning hall is immediately at the place where you pay so you can line up to get your food. To avoid the line at the main entrance of the dinning hall, you can go to the back to pay as well.\n\nThe food here is okay. This is not a high-end restaurant. The food may not be for everyone. Also, there's a self serve ice cream machine, yogurt and salad bar. There are coffee machines and juice dispensers. There are plently of fruits, snacks and bread. At night, the pizza kitchen opens. Food is served in small to medium portion which is perfect for those who do not eat as much or want to try multple things. Chefs are polite and kind and will be willing to give you a bit of extra food if you ask.\n\nThere is no washroom in the dinning hall. You will have to leave the dinning hall and lose your ability to come back to use the washroom.\n\nIf you come here during regular meal times, expect there to be lots of students. If you come during 8:30am, 9:30 am or any time when class is in session, there are not as many people. Menu of the dinning hall can be found at both front and rear entrance.

It is the farthest dining hall compared to the other two.\n\nAfter entering the building, you will have to take a flight of stairs to get to the dining hall. The food available at Place Vanier comes from a variety of different cultures. Everyone will find something good to eat the dining hall. The dining hall can sit 200-300 people. It is a buffet style dining hall and you can get as much food you can eat.\n\nThere is a salad bar and custom sandwich making station. There is a  burgers, tacos, pork bun and pork belly ramen station. Food changes from time to time. It is best to check Nutrislice, the online menu app, to see what food the dining hall is serving before paying. The dining hall building has big windows overlooking the court yard of Place Vanier. You also have different kinds of seats like the Café style seats and also the long dining hall tables.\n\nDuring regular hours like mornings from 8-9am, lunch from 12-1pm, and dinner from 7-9pm, you will find lots of people there. You can avoid the traffic by avoiding these common times or arriving earlier to skip the potential line-up for food.\n\nThe presentation of the dish is average. The portions are small. Food is placed on the counter which may get cold and unclean. Food quality tastes ok, but the servers are more concerned about getting as much food out to as many students and people as possible. During peak hours, the place becomes hectic.  Food also is warm, not hot after peak times. Staff there are friendly and kind.\n\nWashrooms are downstairs, separate from the dining hall.\n\nParking is very close to the dining hall about a 5 minute walk. Near this dining hall, there are lots of nice trees to look at."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNkJTXAZhQtPzHpRvjlF4cdHyFgKSktppk9ET2t\u0026fid=0x0:0xe5bca09347600efd""],""When"":""2024-2-23""},{""Name"":""Raúl de León"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR1w_Ji0Yz-Xp82r5o46luBx2_3UdjKeiMHOkVr4mcBNjLxloC=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I don't know why people give bad reviews, this place is amazing.

They rotate all the time but I like their chicken soup, vegetables and legume curry, whatever bean soup, etc.\n\nGather has too much hate haha. It’s actually one of the healthiest and cheapest residence food among all the three.\n\nI wish they have more cooked green vegetables. They always have potatoes and squash but they don’t have enough broccoli, spinach, green beans, etc.\n\nGrill station is pretty good and they change menu around 2-4 weeks. Salmon burger is decent. I wish their chicken burger is cheaper.\n\nLatino is also my favourite. The Havana bowl is pretty good but sometimes they don’t season the chicken or tofu enough.\n\nHome cooking is also one of my favourite because they rotate the food daily. They have similar food every week. The vegetable lasagna with garlic bread is so good! Not a lot of cheese and love the sauce. Butter chicken is not really good imo.\n\nSandwich station is alright except they don’t have the press!!! Please we def need the press for sandwich especially for those who order with cheese.\n\nSimply local is a lot of people’s favourite. Not too expensive unless you get a main with two sides (around 12-14?).

Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with the food.\n\nI ordered the Aburi Set, which is only available from 11am-4pm. It comes with 3 aburi sushi (salmon, tuna + shrimp), salmon teriyaki on rice, shrimp tempura ×2, spring roll ×2, vegetable tempura ×3 (I think), salad, and miso soup. A breakdown of taste is as follows:\n\nAburi sushi: my expectations were highest for this, which is perhaps why I felt so let down. The salmon aburi was okay, but both the tuna and shrimp aburi were overcooked and dry. None of the aburi tasted like they were \""melting in your mouth\"", which was unfortunate. Perhaps a kitchen error where they were flamed for too long.\n\nSalmon teriyaki on rice: the rice was. Rice. The salmon was mid, super average tasting salmon. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThe tempura (both shrimp and veggies): I've had better, but I've also had worse- again, average.\n\nSpring rolls: small, average tasting.\n\nThe salad: super simple side salad. could benefit from more dressing.\n\nThe miso soup: average. Had a good amount of tofu, seaweed, and enoki mushrooms.\n\nOverall comments; I was able to purchase for about $8.50 because of my coupon. The people who passed me my food were nice and polite. The presentation of the food was also nice! However, I likely would not return if i didnt have a coupon. The regular price for the aburi set (at the time of writing) is $16.99.

I wouldn't go here as a night out, but at the right times, it's a chill hang. The atmosphere varies wildly depending on the day. On some nights it's louder and is in line with what you'd expect a university bar to be like, and sometimes it's very relaxed, and you can even find some people using it as a study spot (not something I would consider or really recommend, but you do you as long as it's not busy and no one needs the table). Sometimes it's somewhere in between or a weird mix of both. It's not always predictable, but I've found that to hit the quieter days that I prefer, early evening during exam season at school is best, and summer in general are chiller than the main academic year.\nThe food is good, often surprisingly good. The menu items are well thought-out and tasty, and nicely presented. It's not a veg-centric establishment but there's lots of choice for vegans! Off the current menu, I've had the Power Punch Salad, the Vegan Pulled Jackfruit, the Vegan Burger, Vegan Chick'n Caesar Wrap, and the Tempeh Teriyaki. I wasn't particularly impressed by the Caesar wrap - it wasn't awful, I just didn't feel like it was worth $19.5, but everything else was a delight. I'm glad their vegan burger is a (seemingly) housemade, minimally processed black bean patty instead of beyond meat or similar! I usually won't order a salad as my meal, but the Power Punch is substantial! The side salad that comes with the sandwich orders is actually pretty nice too.\nThey make good cocktails and have a long list of local draft beers on tap which I haven't really had a chance to dip into, but I got the \""Green Bird\"" for fun on St. Patrick's Day, which is just a version of their house \""T-Bird\"" lager that's been coloured green (maybe naturally, judging by the grassy notes I got from it, but I don't know for sure). It was actually a good lager though!\nSometimes the staff is nice enough, sometimes I get the vibe that they're too cool to be serving me or something, but because the only interactions you have with them are when you order and pay at the bar and when they bring your food out, an unenthusiastic bartender doesn't ruin the whole experience. Because of this service style, you can expect to be in and out of here faster than you would at a full table service restaurant, but it's not fast food, so dishes still take as much time to prep as they would at a \""regular\"" sit-down place. It's also pricier than typical counter service food, but very reasonably priced compared to off-campus restaurants that serve food of this quality, and there's no obligation to tip 20%. To me, the service model, fair prices, and high quality are a combination of the best elements of counter service and full service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQwEdJ88aXsSlarpRs-9jcRwBTBo0B-hIa3KfE\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b84d3debc8f1cec""],""When"":""2021-4-19""},{""Name"":""Steve Morgan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmgrmzSyB3CC_qWamR3pXmaZna6-RxfqDluiFzTGNrypDReGc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very large service area.

The other reasons include that there just isn't that much choice on campus and the food is basic but decent here. The view is nice if you're out on the patio. And there's a lot of space. It's very sad that the sit-down nice restaurant didn't make it because that's exactly what the area needs. They just didn't promote it and since this is the top floor, no one discovers this space by walking by. The service at the Gallery when it was in the old sub was never this sad.

The Sweet \u0026 Spicy Lovers pizza has pineapple slices, so if you enjoy the sweetness of pineapple on your pizza, it could be really nice.

The garlic bread was soaked and then some in butter. There was enough pooled in the nooks of the bread that I could just tip the bread over and pour it off. It’s not like the food was phenomenal before, but I thought it was good enough for a quick-service cafe, but this was just lazy.\nThe baked goods are still the same as you get at other UBC cafes, which I’m mostly a fan of. I find that the decaf espresso in drinks has kind of a burnt taste; it’s alright in lattes, but I had it as an americano today and it wasn’t really worth it for me.\nOn the upside, the value is decent. The pastas and flatbreads are heartier fare than you’ll find at most of the coffee shops (UBC-owned or not) around campus, and my pasta and (big) cookie today came out to about $14 total.

Their menu has definitely evolved over the many years, but my undeniable staples are the Ebi Mayo, Uni Miso Udon, and stone grilled Kobe Beef. These are ALWAYS on point for me. I’m just so sad the Menchi Katsu with rice is no longer on the menu!!! (Why???)\n\nWe also tried the Kanazawa curry with tonkatsu and a Fish of the day teishoku. My aunt loved her fish set. Unfortunately I would recommend the restaurant try to change the bowl you serve your curry in to a more original round bowl or plate because a lot of the sauce was left on one end and wasted. Not as easy to mix into the rice due to the plate’s shape. However the Tonkatsu (pork loin cutlet) was simply outstanding in taste, texture and juiciness!\n\nService was very prompt, polite and our server even gave my daughter a lollipop at the end of a meal.\n\nEvery time I come back to Vancouver to visit my family, I have to dine at Kingyo at least once.

They were open even when classes were not in session.  I love the Dan Dan noodle with 2 lamb skewers combo (comes with a canned drink).  Both were not too spicy for me, super tasty and generous portions.  I also had a breakfast crepe for the first time (ever. I’m just more familiar with Cantonese food) and it was so good and very large and filling.  I like their noodles which have a bit of a chew (look hand pulled rather than the skinny noodles you might expect normally in Dan Dan).  They were the same type of noodles in the meat sauce noodle dish (no soup).  The fried chicken is super crunchy so worth a try if you like fried chicken but I’m not looking for such an oily lunch/dinner.  Everything is fresh because it’s made to order.  They are open at night too. Looks like several of the other food court stalls did not open much.  Best thing to eat on the whole campus in my opinion.
