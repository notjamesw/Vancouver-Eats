lovely waterfront view, creating a pleasant atmosphere for dining. The ingredients are fresh, and the service is attentive. The seafood chowder was rich and flavorful, brimming with fresh seafood that complemented the creamy base perfectly. The grilled ahi tuna was cooked to perfection, with a nice sear on the outside while remaining tender and juicy inside. However, the menu selection is quite limited, which may not satisfy those seeking variety. The prices are more in line with fine dining, though the food and service quality feel average for the cost.

Tables are lovely with white linens, restaurant is spacious with patio seating as well. Nice views of water, mountains and the Rocky Point Park. Food was average in terms of presentation and flavour profile. Calamari was too thinly sliced with overly sweet sauce, acidity was somewhat lacking. Wedge Caesar salad was not appealing, insufficient dressing. Mixed grill seafood with zucchini and carrots: you can elevate this dish by using asparagus and baby carrots instead, and with a few microgreens garnish. Trust me, it’ll make a difference! We concluded our meal with coffee and dessert. Molten chocolate lava cake could’ve been better if there’s a garnish, just a piece of raspberry or blackberry or half strawberry, that would really make a big difference! After our lunch, we strolled at the Rocky Point Park which is just a steps away from the restaurant.

We sat at the patio, the server kept chasing us for ordering food. She came to chase us at least 3 times in about 5mins. No patience at all.\n\nWe have spent about $190 in total. The food portion was very small, especially the seafood tower and steak. The lobster tail was spongy, no taste, not fresh at all. Oyster and mussel were tiny. What’s worst was, all food came to the table almost at the same time. The table was full and we couldn’t enjoy the food one by one. The food was cold, not enjoyable at all.\n\nIt was a birthday celebration. I remarked it when I made the reservation online and reconfirmed again with a phone call. It was expecting to have a complementary desert to surprise my loved one but turned out nothing at the end. It made me very disappointed and upset. I totally regretted to choose this restaurant.\n\nAfter the dinner, I went to the disabled washroom with my little kids for more space. It was totally disgusting. The floor was wet, hand towel paper and toilet paper were on the floor. It was even worst than a public washroom at the park.\n\nI was not willing to pay the tips at all but still paid a bit. I cried out after the dinner and tried to find out the email address to express my feelings after the dinner. I then found out the cost of the kids meal should be $0.99 during Sep 2-30. Why the server still charged me the regular price?? It was kind of cheating.\n\nTotally not recommend to anyone.\n\n————-\n\nI have already sent email to the restaurant on Sep 2 but nobody follow up."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN1V2FVfLLXo-n6x-sL5vigxsoYa-5GcikyCY94\u0026fid=0x0:0x5aa213bcccc48530""],""When"":""2024-9-4""},{""Name"":""J Q"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWWLFaR2htiLNLIQAXB2-FbuNystyoB794RiAm0Uo82lJgg8OdK=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Everything we tried was very enjoyable, and the fries were especially delicious.

Don't forget to ask for a free parking ticket when you arrive. The menu is packed with seafood, and the bar’s equally impressive with plenty of great options. We sampled several pasta dishes, and all were exceptional. Oysters are very reasonably priced, which is always a nice bonus.

Even the Number Stands were dirty (see pic.)\nWhy are there Number Stands in a restaurant anyhow? Did I by accident walk into a food court?\nMoving on.....\n\nThe pita bread that comes with the appetizers was hours from having gone bad....I mean..the mold had packed its bags and on its way to us ....quick.\nTo call what they called \""Kashk e Bademjaan\"" is an insult to the dish...it was more like canned goo...enough said.\n\nThe \""Tahdig Mix with Gheyme and Ghormeh sabzi\"" was an absolute disaster.\nThe \""Tahdig\"" was one layer of pita bread dipped in 3 gallons of cheap oil. The \""Ghormeh Sabzi\"" was mostly red beans and the \""Gheymeh\"" was mostly just lentils and tomato paste.  Honestly, I don't even know how to put it into words....and that rarely happens with me.\nMoving onto the Mains.......\n\nThe \""Loghmeh\"" was so tough that I jus stopped eating. It was so dry it was hard to swallow and unseasoned on top of everything. Why didn't I mention anything to the servers? Well...let's just say I knew that I would've been received with a combination of ignorance and indifference.\nThat was the vibe of the servers in general.\n\nThe Lamb Shank was covered with fat that is supposed to be removed with this dish. So, there is just blubbering fat covering 1/3 of your plate, instead of tender lean lamb meat on the bone. The dill rice was overcooked and all of it was unsalted and unseasoned.\n\nWe asked for Coke 0 and got Diet Coke. No glass served. No ice served.\nMoving onto the desert. We thought maybe their desert will at least finish with a positive note.\nThey had 1. Bakhlava. If you serve their Bakhlava to either a Turk, a Persian or a Greek.\nThey will throw it at you. It was not Bakhlava. It was old, off-base, and an insult to this delicious middle eastern/mediterranean desert. Sad.\n\nThe atmosphere felt and looked cold, detached, bare and neglected.\nNeglected of attention, care and love for business.\nAnd boy did it show!\n\nHonestly, as someone who loves dining out, who classifies customer service not be only crucial but an art, and as someone who has been fortunate to know good food and drink.\nThis is the first time I have felt disgust.

They were all delicious, in fact it was difficult to choose a favorite because they were so distinct from each other. Out of the 3 flavours we tasted, the Black Pepper was the most basic with a great crunch, whereas the Gangnam was the most complex with a beautiful sauce that softened the crispy coating. The Red Chak Chak was good too, with a hearty bite of heat, but like the others, not at all greasy or oily, nor too salty.\nIn addition, the side of french fries were good, especially the light seasoning and complimentary dipping sauce. But if I had any complaint, the french fries were a little over-priced ($7), which is the cheapest option of the potato fry options, so I think we’ll make our own next time.\nNevertheless, We have a new Go-To for fried chicken, with many more flavours to try out!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNhHQxF-1DYeHpMQIoXpNKu964mb3UXJikfj1wo\u0026fid=0x0:0xd72e6e0b02310cc""],""When"":""2022-2-17""}]",

We indulged in their signature brews, the Stiff Upper Lip and Guts and Glory, both of which were delightful. However, the star of the show, the margarita pizza, unfortunately fell short of expectations. It lacked the crispness we hoped for, and the sparse basil leaf placement provided a comedic touch.

Thankfully the musicians were entertaining so that was good. It looks like there is an effort being made to make the place fun and inviting but it needs some tweaks, in my opinion.\nEDIT: In response to the manager's reply I want to say that \""advertise\"" regarding the pizza was a poor word choice so my bad. What I meant was the toppings in the menu description. I don't recall seeing the word Neopolitan on either the table or wall menu or the website. From reading other reviews about the pizza, I think adding Neapolitan would be helpful to manage customer's expectations. And suggesting I go to Fresh Slice for a loaded pizza felt like a dig. Or maybe that's a poor word choice also. The comment made me feel that the manager's attitude is, If you don't like our pizza, go somewhere else. Trust me, I will.

Our server was very attentive, though it did start to feel like we were rushed (maybe they had other reservations coming in and didn’t want us to overstay).\n\nWe ordered the Spicy Margarita and the Mexican Mule to start since the drink reviews were strong. Was very nice to see the tequila options were good and they weren’t just using Sauza. We both asked for Maestro Dobel tequila with our drinks and they didn’t disappoint.\n\nWe started with chips and salsa because I always measure quality and authenticity based on the quality of the in-house salsa. The flavour was okay, but likely would be better if it had sat for a bit to allow the flavours to seep throughout. Most of the chips were stale, which didn’t help.\n\nThen tried the queso fundido which was disappointing. Seemed to be mozzarella cheese with no added flavour and ok chorizo.\n\nThen we shared the enchiladas with salsa verde. The shredded chicken lacked flavour and there was feta cheese on top (Greek cheese, not Mexican).\n\nTo anyone else’s standards this would be good quality, however I readily admit my standards are high.

But I do understand they were busy and these things can happen, so not a big deal.\n\nThe churros with ice cream at the end of the meal was fantastic and left us with a good impression.\n\nOverall, despite a few hiccups for a our first experience, I can say Sabor A Mexico offers a delicious authentic Mexican food and we will be coming back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNSVkM9338yfbqQZoEwPrEc1CUj0FBn04hs3JVe\u0026fid=0x0:0xa7058c9abc9572bf""],""When"":""2024-6-11""}]",

here with my friend for dinner a few nights ago. We were so excited to try it out due to their high ratings online. The atmosphere and set up I found was super cute and a great addition to the take out food.\n\nFirst thing we noticed was that even though we were the only ones there , it took them over 25 mins to prepare our burgers and fries. I ordered the bacon and Brie burger and the bacon was very tough to chew. I had to take it out of the burger completely. My friend ordered the Smokey bbq glaze burger. But I wouldn’t say it had any “Smokey”ness to it. Aswell our burger patties were dry and had zero taste. We were a little disappointed about both burgers ..it just didn’t seem very fresh or flavourful. Their signature sauce was very tasty though , and was a nice touch to both burgers.\nWe also ordered truffle fries which was probably the most disappointing. It barely had any cheese ( see photo below ) was cold, and barely had any truffle taste to it. For 12$ I would say it is absolutely not worth buying.\n\nThe service from the staff was great though, they were very nice and friendly.\n\nOne other thing which we thought was strange. They have these beautiful black take out bags. And we noticed a “scan for a surprise “ on the bag. Once scanned all it did was take us to their website to read more about them aha. Which is fine .. but we weren’t sure how much of a surprise that was. Was a bit misleading. Maybe it should say “ scan for more info about us “ instead. Just a thought."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO_IFDgQ_JGQn9NsvEfPyyJ9Ky92Je5qdN_FTti\u0026fid=0x0:0xca7f3f9b84c47ade""],""When"":""2024-10-15""},{""Name"":""Brian Bortolin"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKbhq0GNavbT8429FkErVkTqQcAimBuCcEuu2JQyCOtAFPgDQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Nestled next to Rocky Point Park and right on Brewery Road, Blaze Gourmet Burgers is a burger lover's paradise!\n\nThe **classic burger** is to die for – seriously, I had to pinch myself to make sure I hadn't gone to burger heaven.

The first server, a lady, guided us to our seats and helped us order two lunch deals and an additional side. The food tasted fine, and the prices were okay. The environment was decent, but the service was shockingly rude.\n\nWhen my mom asked for takeout boxes and the bill, a different, younger male server came by, literally tossed the boxes onto the table, and walked away. When he returned with the bill and card machine, he dropped them on the table and left again without a word. It was the worst dining experience I've ever had. He didn’t say a single sentence to us the entire time, and I wondered how he was even qualified to be a server. I still paid the 12% tip because I was in a rush and a client was messaging me. Miraculously, the moment he saw I left a tip, he finally said, 'Thank you.'\n\nIf I hadn’t been in a rush, I would’ve found the manager and asked if this is how they treat customers. To top it off, as we were finishing our conversation and about to leave, the first lady server came up and started clearing the table while we were still sitting, with food still on the table. Asking a simple question like, 'Is it okay to take your plates away?' wouldn’t have hurt. I’m genuinely curious—is it that hard for them to communicate with customers? I understand wanting to clean up, but all the tables around us were empty.\n\nI felt like we were being treated like parasites, where no one wanted to serve us. I will never visit this place again—no one on earth should be treated like that."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPLNfDxJ8jGJAfNSew8RsXJy3wea-XdqoQ4OSpK\u0026fid=0x0:0xe1616bd724b15843""],""When"":""2024-9-15""},{""Name"":""Stephanie Leigh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKRl-iaFLQxQ8oJ72otIPqBzU4rYUb-w4AClnbcEnjWvh00AA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Apologies to my former fav sushi restaurant but, Hanayuki is officially my new favorite Sushi Restaurant in the lower mainland.\nThe food came out so quickly, the staff were super friendly and accommodating despite us arriving an hour before closing, and the atmosphere was warm with very cozy seating.\nIt is close to some popular local spots like Rocky Point, Belcara, Sasamat Lake, and Buntzen so we will be back again regularly which is an absolute treat.\nThe quality of the food and fish was unparalleled and the miso soup really hit the spot after a cold swim.

It had been a few years since we last went there and I'd been itching to go there for awhile. As the name of the shop implies, they serve Roti, but not just any Roti...they serve Trinidadian style Roti. My mother was born and raised in Trinidad, so Trinidadian food holds a special place in my heart.\n\nTrinidadian Roti is basically a wrap sandwich that's filled with curried meat, vegetable or seafood filling. There's dhalpourie roti or paratha roti (also known as bussup shut). Rehanah's Roti sells dhalpourie roti. Difference between dhalpourie and bussup shut? The explanation I've heard is that bussup shut is \""busted up\"" into tattered pieces.\n\nRoti: We ordered Shrimp Roti and Mixed Veggie Roti. Awesome flavour; however the filling is heavy with potatoes and sparse on the other ingredients. The Vegetarian Rotis are all under $10; however, the meat and seafood Rotis can be a bit pricey considering how much of the Roti is filled with potato.\n\nService: Fair (One woman running the entire shop. She takes the order, runs the till, and makes the food.)\nParking: Free street parking\nLocation: On St. Johns St., which is a main street lined with shops and restaurants in Port Moody.\n\nIt's a very small restaurant and as a result of the pandemic they only do takeout. There is however, a small table and chairs to sit and wait while your order is being prepared.There are so few places that serve Trinidadian food.

I ordered the magic mushroom burger and the burger was completely dry, and it barely had any mushrooms and was lacking any flavour whatsoever. My friend ordered the wagyu burger and it was even drier than mine and absolutely overcooked. Will say the only decent thing about our meal was we upgraded to yam fries which were good. I was pretty shocked as this place claims to have award winning burgers. My other friend ordered the Thai curry bowl, which claims to come with chicken and shrimp.

The only thing I've enjoyed more at other restaurants are the California rolls and agedashi tofu.

What I noticed right away was that all of the toppings were intact large pieces of pepperoni, green peppers and mushrooms (nothing minced on this pizza).

With the same entry fee, and four times the attendees, one would think the Port Moody Legion would be supportive of the event.\n\nOn arrival, before the event start, I went to the bar to order two beverages, along with glasses of water. I was informed that management had just instigated a policy of only selling bottled water. I have run across this policy before, when one is only requesting water. I have never been refused water with a meal or a beverage order before.\n\nTo reinforce a poor management decision, the manager chose not to be available for the inauguration of this policy.  This is unfair to the employees, who must face the sour customers. Luckily, the bartender had good customer service skills dealing with the unfortunate position he was placed in.  I guess the bartender will either find a better establishment for employment or become the manager at this Legion.\n\nWe will definitely not be recommending that our Legion friends drop into this branch.  It will just be a story of how good we have it at home!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Shannon Craig"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKkcCTiYPJx6mTtL4cFio0D_2WqDJBVB2_sRqMM-Qko3xx7=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Enjoyed my experience at the Port Moody Legion.

Anyways, in the area taking care of some business so decided to try this location out.\n\nIt’s located on the front side of Coquitlam Center and facing the new Cactus Club, plentiful of parking is available up front in the malls parking lot.\n\nInside is separated into to section; Neptune Wonton for fast casual dishes and Neptune Seafood for more of a formal dining. It’s kind of a smaller place and pretty basic to me.\n\nAnyways, here were the dim sum I ordered;\n\n1. Seafood dumpling in soup. The imitation crab being used made the broth a bit overly sweet, was too unpleasant to finish it.\n2. Steamed spicy beef tripe. It wasn’t tender enough, needed to steam it a bit longer.\n3. Steamed chicken feet with special sauce. It wasn’t tender enough for the skin to fall off the bone, needed to run through the deep fryer a bit longer during the prep process.\n4. Turnip cake with XO sauce. It’s almost a joke, my 10 year old nephew could’ve done better with this dish especially its presentation. Failed!\n5. Baked preserved egg and ginger pastry. Absolutely horrible, the preserved egg was rubbery and the whole pastry crumbled along with its ginger paste. Failed!\n6. Fried vegetables with shrimp paste. An alternate version of the deep fried eggplant with shrimp paste. It was so so.\n7. Baked bbq pork buns. It was okay, the bbq pork could be less sweet.\n8. Purple rice roll with fish paste. It was okay, the super jumbo size was unexpected.\n9. Stir fry udon with live lobster. Surprisingly it was pretty good, enough wok hay to really bring out the flavours.\n10. Little white rabbit pudding. Not bad, cute little treats.\n\nOverall, I wasn’t too impressed with the layout and atmosphere of the restaurant. It portray itself as a mid class Chinese seafood restaurant, but felt l like a simple family restaurant with mid level prices.\n\nThe service was okay, enough to satisfy the basics, don’t expect anything more than that.\n\nAs for the food, honestly it was probably one of the most disappointing experience I had so far out of all the Neptunes I’ve been to.\n\nNot a repeat or recommendation from me anytime soon… 1.5 stars"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQR35TFh2sABn6mWQv4-F7inIjdWxHkqeXqX1w\u0026fid=0x0:0xe8960ddf73ad1704""],""When"":""2024-6-3""},{""Name"":""Danny Y"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8eoyUE6az-FmQo7i2mVq5z64Ow48sgKu1EmLZc0zWWN6DMy5asw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Came for dimsum.

We are going to stick with our old faithful which is strictly Indian food. This place may offer too many styles of food which may mean they are just mediocre making all of them instead of being fantastic with one style. We don't recommend nor will we be ordering anything from them in the future... even though we only had the Indian since it was mediocre we are going to have to assume the rest is as well. I almost forgot... we ordered a piece of cheesecake as well..it was horrible, I actual think it had gone off and they smothered it with all this sweet sauce to cover it up. DISGUSTING.

Unfortunately, i have to change the mark to 1 star because of the following objective evidences:\n\""Although you mentioned that your supplier has an accredited halal certificate, based on my observations during everyday shopping and watching your Deli and Meatshop employees, it seems that you are not adhering to halal provider rules. Specifically, you are selling halal and non-halal meat together and using the same knives and surfaces to cut them. The regulations in this regard are similar to those for allergen and non-allergen items, where cross-contamination is strictly prohibited. Rather than this, open packages of halal and non-halal meat inside the freezer or fridge should be completely separated. I recommend that you read the Halal International Standard requirements for retail stores. Until you are able to meet these standards, please remove all halal signage from your store, as it is misleading to Muslim customers in this regard\"""",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ali Fasihizadeh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXeEgxRiuCQGGcgBhaC0R0-E7HN9SKaiGfOrL8NTnYlp6WMk2xa=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I recently ordered a birthday cake to Suzan at the bakery and I couldn’t be happier with the result!

I brought to the attention of the cashier that I had purchased some barbari bread a few days ago, and that I was told these were baked the night before.\nUnfortunately when I took the bread home and opened it on the same day, I found both to be rotten and stale. I did not want to drive all the way back for a little refund that. The following week while shopping at the store, I informed the cashier. All I sought was a simple acknowledgment of my concern and an apology for the inconvenience. Instead, what followed was a lengthy justification about how fresh bread can spoil overnight due to moisture. Additionally, the cashier explained their return policy, stating that I should have brought back the receipt and the rotten bread for a refund.\nI felt that the response lacked empathy and a proper understanding of customer service. The interaction came off as arrogant, and it left me feeling undervalued as a customer. It is disappointing to know that, as a loyal customer, my concerns were not taken seriously.

So I would only want to go again if it’s $35 per person. I don’t eat much and I don’t feel it’s cost worthy. It could be great for young adults who eats a lot.\nThe good part about their food and services is that they would cut the cooked portion off and go back to cook again, measuring the best time.\nI enjoy the top sirloin (which I cannot cook so well at home) which is very soft and smooth. Chicken heart is tender and good as well. Another recommendation is flank steak, so tasty.\nI normally enjoy strip loin (New York steak) but I don’t like theirs because the center is too chewy and the outside is well done already. They cut such a thick portion and I cannot cut or chew the size they gave me.\nAnother thing I wouldn’t recommend is the chickens wrapped by bacon, because the chicken breast is dry and flavorless.\nForgot to mention, my wife enjoyed the deep fried banana and pineapple, and she had to order the second basket.\n\nOverall, great place to hangout with friends because they don’t kick people away, you can take your time to enjoy the night; but not very worthy of going with young child because you cannot take your time.

In the end, decided on this place since it’s been decade or longer since I have been to this place.\n\nUpon entering, it seems like the interior went through a bit of change and renovation. The place was pretty empty except for 3 booths seated with customers, maybe it was near closing time (1.5hrs before closing). Everything appeared to be clean throughout the restaurant with a comfortable spacing between the tables and booths.\n\nThe service was subpar from the server, maybe she was more focused on cleaning and getting off work. When the owner/ manager took over, it was a lot better and she was more polite.\n\nHere were the food I ordered;\n\n1. Sizzling Hot plate combo B+B (chicken steak \u0026 sausages) with borscht soup, spaghetti , cold lemon tea. The chicken was a little dry and the soup was a bit off and warm only. And the hot plate didn’t sizzle at all, maybe a 3 second frisk sound?\n2. Sizzling hot place combo A+B (filet mignon \u0026 deep fried oysters) with lobster bisque, steamed rice, add lobster tail $23 extra. The filet mignon was horrible, first time ever struggling to chew a filet mignon, it was dry and didn’t taste fresh. The oysters were little midgets. The steamed rice was more like overnight rice just added a bit of water and a quick heat up by the microwave, it was dry and hard. And lastly the lobster tail was horrible; it had that bad fishy taste to it, one tiny bite from that and had to stop cause not worth food poisoning myself from it. And once again the sizzling plate wasn’t even warm!! (Facepalm) The only thing okay was the lobster bisque.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed with the food. I don’t remember it being this bad? What happened? Closer to closing time and whoever the cook in the kitchen was didn’t give 2 cents about the food being served? Is it really that hard to hire a decent cook nowadays after the pandemic? And for crying out loud, it only takes 30 seconds to heat up the iron plates and how can one pawn off such a bad bowl of rice in a Chinese restaurant? I honestly would send this cook packing for retirement if working for me, definitely wouldn’t tolerate this kind of bs jeopardizing my business.\n\nI guess I retained my good nature and composure by taking into consideration that the owner/manager was very polite and friendly; very poise and elegant with the services. I guess that’s the only good part of this experience and kept my positivity inlined. Just enjoyed a quick instant noodle when back home lol"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMMcEYpyZUuanHEcQL55fa0WprgsuAX0S3V4h87\u0026fid=0x0:0xa9d123f17cb34070""],""When"":""2024-1-25""},{""Name"":""Chang Wun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXinnRETbtdmwq0G3dzHpocXq4c0y1kT8tCLTmXT5-MPrsCx3WH9g=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went back for the breakfast.

If you become a member, which costs $15 per year, you can enjoy a 10% discount on all orders, which is a great deal.\n\nOne of the highlights of Copa Cafe is their breakfast menu, which boasts generous portions that won't hurt your wallet despite the current high prices. On my recent visit, I opted for the satay beef noodle and shared the cheese, spinach, and bacon omelette with my husband. We also ordered two cups of their famous Hong Kong-style milk tea. After applying the 10% membership discount, our bill was a reasonable $23 with the tip included.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with both the quality and quantity of our breakfast. The flavors were satisfactory, and the portions were generous. Copa Cafe is a must-visit spot for anyone who loves Hong Kong-style cuisine and wants to try something new.

The experience and food did not disappoint! We held a birthday party for 13 people, which was tricky for the layout of the tables. However, the staff were beyond accommodating and made it work. They could have used a few more servers on a busy Saturday night, but the staff were very friendly and immediately responsive whenever we asked.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, including the seafood hot pot, fishcake soup and fried fish. Amazing flavours and textures, with generous portions that are ample for sharing! The fried items were light \u0026 crispy. The steaming umami soups had just the right amount of spicy kick. You won't find traditional bibimbap, japchae or pancakes because their menu heavily features innovative takes on fresh seafood - not for those with shellfish allergies! Plenty of Korean spirits to test out \u0026 quench your thirst! At first glance the prices seem high but considering that the plates can be shared, the restaurant offers great value.

I also didn’t like how the pasta noodle was too over done? 😬\n\nThe tiramisu was delicious as well.\n\nOne thing to have in mind as well is the parking.. if you go during a busy time.. you might need to park in the residential area up the street and walk..\n\nOverall, Doppio Zero Pizza is a must-visit if you’re craving top-tier pizza.

When I got home with our order, I noticed that my husband's dip has a best before date of Jan 31, 2025. My dip, however, is listed as Sept 18, 2024 (so, 3 weeks from now). We are a 2-person household who like different pizzas and different dips / flavours. As with everything, the cost of pizza and dips, etc has gone up. A jar now costs $7.65 (a little less than 1/2 the cost of a small pizza). I can't possibly eat this much dip in 3 weeks time, and am annoyed that my husband's dip will last so much longer than mine. So, when I call to complain, I'm told that \""customer care\"" says that the dips only last for two weeks after they've been opened, and that they can't help, compensate or accommodate me in any way because the dip wasn't sold as expired!

Singaporean cuisine but I’ve heard good things about Singapore hawker so I finally decided to try. The staff seemed very friendly right upon entering. We ordered the pork belly, beef skewers, and the Nasi Goreng. Everything was very tasty, the Nasi Goreng had still a kick to it despite asking for mild. My complain was that the shrimp chips were a bit stale. The beef skewers were kind of on the skinnier side, but were definitely not dry and the peanut sauce was amazing. The crispy pork belly was probably what shined the most.

The fish cake used did not have the springy texture that is found in Singapore fishballs and fish cake. There's also not enough egg in it.

Overall I really liked it and we will go back to try lunch and dinner ."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNHNXWlB85awZcVo4LsFWw7YzcOUxmmYs4aAxUG\u0026fid=0x0:0xb89aa5370ad1307a""],""When"":""2024-4-8""}]",

She argued that the chicken bone might have ended up in our fries because the same deep-fry basket and oil were used for both chicken and fries. Even if this explanation were accurate, it is entirely unacceptable and unhygienic.\n\nWe left the restaurant without receiving a proper apology, feeling unheard and disrespected.

Despite the restaurant's good reputation, we encountered several issues during our visit.\n1.\tPricing Confusion: The price for a specific dish was different for takeout compared to dining in, which wasn’t clearly indicated in the advertisement outside. This led to some confusion and disappointment considering the service fee and expected tips.\n2.\tService Issues: The waitress was not as friendly as we had hoped, and her attitude was noticeably different when serving non-Persian guests. Additionally, she insisted that I speak in Persian with her, which felt inappropriate.\n3.\tOrder Mistake: One of our orders was initially incorrect. Although the correct dish was eventually brought to us, the delay was inconvenient.\n4.\tTea and Dessert: When ordering tea and dessert, we were told the tea pot was only enough for two people, despite it being sufficient for our group of five. Also, when we asked for extra candy, the waitress’s attitude seemed unwelcoming, even though the candy was a minor request.\n5.\tBilling Process: The process of splitting the bill for tea and dessert was not accommodated. We were told that one person must pay the entire bill, and we would need to settle among ourselves later. This was quite odd and embarrassing, especially since splitting bills is a common practice.\n6. The quality of food was fair.\nWhile we appreciate the restaurant's efforts to provide a unique dining experience, these issues made our visit less enjoyable.

The marinated beef short ribs were so irresistible that we ended up ordering extra.\n\nWe were expecting the bill to be around $200, but were pleasantly surprised when it came out $60 cheaper—even with the tip included.

This place is like the Aladdin's cave of donairs, filled with treasures of flavor and freshness.

Seriously, watching them work the dough in the machine and then heating up on the stove like watching an ancient Middle Eastern cooking show – mesmerizing!\n\nNow, let's talk about the donairs themselves. These bad boys are stuffed with ingredients so fresh, they might as well have been plucked from the Garden of Eden. Each bite is a flavor explosion that’ll have you saying, “Open sesame!” for more. And the size? Let’s just say, Ali Baba would need more than 40 thieves to finish one of these beasts! We got the chicken 🍗 one, and was pleasantly satisfied after.\n\nSure, Mega Donair might not be the cheapest eatery in the souk, but with the quality and freshness of their ingredients, plus the friendliness of the staff, it’s worth every dinar. The service is as warm as a Middle Eastern bazaar, and the flavors will take your taste buds on a magic carpet ride.\n\nSo, if you’re in Port Moody and craving a donair that’s fit for a king, head over to Mega Donair.  Your taste buds will be belly dancing with joy!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPgrkhj5xVUjAfVjhzyVEHRmpAEg6bBJIxdkiZD\u0026fid=0x0:0x5e0681c0310f59d8""],""When"":""2024-6-18""},{""Name"":""James Tasker"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL9NiNIaLm_vJXAOyrHHjnqFvKsK-Y4c4_NtjLMC68D0-TJQg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Honestly, I’ve had loads of Donairs from everywhere in the province.

Vancouver!\n\nI’ve been coming to Illo Kimbap Cafe since they opened earlier this year, and it’s quickly become one of my go-to spots. We’ve also had Illo cater two events at university for around 50 people, and they were amazing both times. The kimbap platters were fresh, beautifully presented, and a hit with everyone. I also love how they introduce seasonal items—recently, they added a Lobster Kimbap, which was unique and absolutely delicious.\n\nIllo offers a wide variety of kimbap, with plenty of meat and non-meat options to accommodate different dietary preferences. Some of my personal favorites are the Illo/Skinny Elephant Kimbap, Natto Roo, and Soy Salmon Kimbap, but honestly, you can’t go wrong with anything. They even include estimated calories and feature healthy ingredients (plus keto options), making it easy to enjoy without straying from your diet.\n\nOutside of kimbap, their Tteokbokki, sandwiches, and tiramisu desserts are also worth trying. The Egg Sandwich, in particular, is super filling and uniquely prepared.\n\nIt’s a takeout-only spot, and the portions are very generous for the price, making it both convenient and great value. On top of that, the family and employees who run Illo are incredibly nice—they’re always welcoming and happy to explain menu items or recommend new things to try.\n\nI highly recommend giving this a try if you’re in the area!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM0HmzBxFauXPgT48gHe6W5gga3TTaAChqUUAk\u0026fid=0x0:0x851307994e80a3c""],""When"":""2024-11-17""},{""Name"":""Susy S."",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXOXFRmPNhvtrh6EsN703ph8OLmY1L5EksqjupPcRZsoEiF39uMiQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I recently ordered a catering order from Illo and was so happy with my experience.

We tried kimbap (Chichi kimbap, Spicy pork kimbap), sandwiches (Egg salad, Strawberry \u0026 mango) and juices (Mango, Blueberry). Illo Kimbap cafe is now our new favourite Kimbap place to go. Here is why:\n\n1. Kimbap\nIt was one of the best kimbaps I've ever had, including the ones I had in Korea. Spicy pork kimbap is full of flavour. I highly recommend drizzling a bit of ssamjang sauce as it enhances the flavour even more. Then the Chichi kimbap was a refreshing change. Its light and crisp flavours were a welcome addition to the meal. Perfect combination.\n\nKimbap is usually heavy on carbs. But Illo's kimbap is nutritionally well-balanced. Every piece was so big and filling, yet I didn't feel heavy or bloated afterwards. They do not save on great ingredients nor compromise quality. 200% recommended.\n\n2. Sando (sandwich)\nAs soon as my husband and I had our first bite of the Strawberry and mango sando, we were like, wow. First, the cream was pleasantly sweet. I didn't know cream could be so refreshing and light! It is not overly sweet, not greasy, and has no artificial flavour. Also, fruits are all the way from the top to the bottom of the sandwich. The egg sandwich was creamy and flavorful. It tastes like a healthy homemade sandwich, full of flavour without being heavy on mayonnaise. I loved the egg in the middle.\n\n3. Service\nFrom the server to the kitchen team, everyone was welcoming and friendly. They kindly explain the ingredients and share recommendations if you are not familiar with the menus.\n\n4. Price\nSome people say it is pricey for kimbap. But I think it is super reasonable. Once you see the size \u0026 quality of Illo Kimbap and taste them, it is totally worth it and not expensive at all.\n\n5. Overall\nI could feel the Illo team was dedicated to serving a healthy and tasty meal. They chose fresh ingredients, and I could taste the difference. I am definitely coming back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMAgBYqh9ljnXRrca5jRn5dJtlk3ltsr9BbbJEx\u0026fid=0x0:0x851307994e80a3c""],""When"":""2024-6-19""},{""Name"":""Scott Lee"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXHpW7vGME__Zs4wKjXR04Upnw88bkVVyz-H2288JsHocq9vI3r=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Each kimbap roll only has 5 kimbaps but don’t let that fool you!

The sauce is made with real wasabi and the kimbap is such a refreshing summer treat! The chi chi kimbap with the white kimchi is also divineeee.\n\nI love how versatile these kimbaps are for whichever meal you want to eat it for. Also, speaking as a Korean who grew up eating homemade kimbap, this is hands down, my favourite kimbap spot in all of Metro Vancouver.\n\nIt’s not your typical kimbap rolls, but you can tell each roll was thoughtfully crafted.

Let me tell you, this place knows how to make your taste buds do the cha-cha. I waddled in expecting a quick sugar rush and left with a full-on breakfast love affair. Here’s the scoop:\n\nFirst off, the chocolate chip cookie dough doughnut. It’s like someone took my childhood dreams of sneaking cookie dough out of the fridge and deep-fried them into a perfectly golden doughnut. Absolute perfection. Then there was the apple crumble doughnut—crispy, sweet, with that lovely crumbly topping that made me think of Grandma’s kitchen (if Grandma was a Michelin-star chef in disguise). Together, they were like the dynamic duo of dessert—Batman and Robin, but covered in sugar and far tastier.\n\nNow, let me talk about the cheesy smoky breakfast sandwich. My friends, I have had a lot of breakfast sandwiches in my day. I’ve been around the eggy block, had my share of bacon-stacked bagels, and yes, even tangoed with the occasional McMuffin. But this one? It was life-altering. Like, call-your-mom-and-tell-her-you-found-the-one kind of good. I’m not even joking when I say this was the best breakfast sandwich I’ve ever had. Hands down, no debate. The cheese was melty, the smokiness was spot on, and the bread hugged the filling like it knew I needed that kind of emotional support that morning. Bravo, Doughnut Love, bravo.\n\nAnd then there was the pistachio latte. I thought it was pretty good—creamy with that distinct pistachio nuttiness. But my girlfriend? She took one sip, wrinkled her nose, and gave me that look like I had just offered her a cup of blended brussels sprouts. So yeah, it’s a bit of a polarizing beverage. I was happy, she wasn’t, and I ended up with two lattes. Win-win for me, honestly.\n\nOverall, Doughnut Love is definitely worth the visit. Whether you’re after doughnuts that’ll make you reconsider what you know about dessert or a breakfast sandwich that might just change your life, this is the spot. Plus, it’s always fun to take your taste buds on an adventure—even if it means having to finish your partner’s drink. Check it out. Trust me, your stomach will thank you."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBicJQNVZ3eHQ0mQVOJAQIJgDpPzUg6SHE_QzI\u0026fid=0x0:0xfe2868f806edf31d""],""When"":""2024-10-5""},{""Name"":""Sunny Bui"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKMzWAiXdng0rCtZP9l45dHvlvYqeLHGoUweyd_OjqtW7kL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing Donut Place!

I opted to dine in after the thorough explanation and genuine service even before I sat. Once I settled on an order the staff loudly shouted to the kitchen staff and proceeded to hand me utensils/water. Moments later I could hear a meat mallet being slammed against what can be presumed to be my order (pork loin cutlet). Not long after I sat down another customer came in asking to look at the menu and explaining they're unfamiliar with the concept. the food came out quickly. The deep fried loin was pleasantly plated; light tasting; and juicy with flavour. 5/5 food. 5/5 service. 5/5 ambiance. Seems like cabbage salad sides are unlimited too! Beginning to end this was 5/5.

The fish sauce was light and tangy, complementing the savory pork perfectly without overwhelming the flavors.\n\nThe balance of flavors in this bowl was spot on, and the accompanying spring rolls were crispy and packed with flavor, a fantastic addition. The presentation was also great—very appetizing with vibrant colors.\n\nService was quick and friendly despite the restaurant being busy, and the atmosphere was casual and inviting.

I have also been to their new location on Kingsway. We have tried many different dishes from their House special pho, spicy beef pho, house special with saté broth, their rice dishes, vermicelli dishes, chicken wings, salad rolls, and their bahn mi. We have brought our friends and family several times to eat at Pho Superbowl because we loved their food and generous portions.\n\nToday, I ordered #66 grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli which I have had plenty of times before, but for some reason, the grilled pork tasted sour and off, like the meat had already gone bad. I waved down one of the servers to let them know and she was nice enough to offer to change it to a different meat. I picked out all of the spoiled meat into a small bowl which she took back to the kitchen. Then, I heard the head cook angrily yell in the background. Shortly after, a different lady came back with the same bowl with the spoiled pork and said they can't give me a new one because \""I already ate it\"". What do you mean I already ate it? It wasn't like I finished all the food and asked for a new bowl for free! I just took out all of the spoiled pork out of my vermicelli bowl and planned to eat the rest of the food!\n\nI am beyond disappointed especially since we loved coming to eat here and we were always generous with tipping.... but we are not coming back. I understand that restaurants can sometimes have a one-off, and I am usually willing to give another chance.

We had to flag them down multiple times just to get basic things like water refills.\n\nThe food, which I was looking forward to the most, was underwhelming. The pierogi were bland, lacking any real flavor or seasoning, and the filling was far too dry. The borscht was greasy and tasted more like something that had been reheated multiple times rather than freshly made. It was also way too salty, which made it hard to finish.\n\nThe manager/owner, when I raised my concerns, was dismissive and unhelpful. Rather than apologizing or offering a solution, they seemed indifferent to our experience. It’s always frustrating when management doesn’t take feedback seriously, and it only made the situation worse. It felt like they weren’t interested in improving their service or maintaining customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I won’t be returning.

But every body knows, in our modern times, this equation is quite impossible in big cities because of the cost and profit concerns.\n\nBut in this pizza shop they nearly got the perfect combination.\n\nThey have a real stove oven at the right temperature, good quality ingredients and handmade authentic dough.\n\nBoth pizza and Foccacia are nicely crusty and juicy. The Tomato sauce is not bitter nor too sweet, just yummy and fresh  ;-).\n\nToppings and mozzarella have a very good price to quality ratio.\n\nAll the ingredients are really really fresh 👍\n\nA suggestion for them, I think you should make a pizza with different ingredients which are hard to find in PoCo\n\nAnd for me the most important thing , people in this pizza shop are really happy, hospitable, positive and energetic. They really smile to you because they just want to. The total vibe is just like the warm and welcoming family owned pizza shops in Italy too 😍😍.\n\nPs: I asked the owner to tour the kitchen because of my cleanliness obsession.

Both were delicious. My husband said that the burger is one of the best that he has had. The burger was loaded with tomatoes, bacon and onions and he really liked the burger sauce that came with it as well. The bacon was thick and my husband said that the caramelized onions made the burger. I also found my Clubhouse to have been very good also with thick bacon, ham, and a generous amount of grilled chicken. The fries were crispy and the picture with the Clubhouse did not have all the fries that came with the order. We both have left overs for tomorrow. We are always cautiously optimistic when ordering home delivery due to the food not being fresh out of the kitchen. Well, we were so pleased with our meals and will definitely be ordering again.

Whether with my family or just the two of us, we’ve enjoyed countless breakfasts here, including many Mother’s Day and Father’s Day celebrations. The restaurant's modern design and simplicity create an upscale breakfast experience, even though it maintains a casual and welcoming vibe.\n\nSeating is limited, and I still recall waiting outside with social distancing protocols in place during the early post-COVID days. Last week, we visited again, and as always, I ordered my favorite: chicken waffles with whipped cream and strawberry topping on the side. My wife, on the other hand, loves trying something different every time we visit. The food arrived quickly, and as usual, it was very tasty.\n\nHowever, (our visit on Nov 30th)  I do want to share one piece of feedback from this visit. My wife and I were enjoying our coffee after finishing our meal when the server brought the check—completely understandable, especially when tables need to turn over for waiting guests. But this time, there were four empty tables, and no one was waiting. Moments later, while we were still sipping our coffee, the server returned with the cordless payment unit and stood by our table. We were both caught off guard, thinking, “What…?” We paid because the payment unit was already there, and the server was waiting, but the interaction felt rushed.\n\nHaving owned a restaurant in downtown Vancouver, I understand the need to turn tables efficiently. That said, there’s an unspoken etiquette between servers and guests, and this instance felt a bit abrupt—particularly since the restaurant wasn’t busy.  It’s a small issue, and I’m sure it wasn’t intentional, but I wanted to share this experience in the hopes it’s not repeated for other guests.\n\nOf course, we will continue visiting Big Flat Pancake because we love the food, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is just some constructive feedback for management or ownership to consider.\n\nThank you, and see you again soon!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN3DgZTp8jMRgeo2EOBKceMPW-1SSt0lYSYOwaO\u0026fid=0x0:0xaaebff47a4a99ef2""],""When"":""2024-12-10""}]",

tonight from Dinakis (through skip the dishes). Ordered my regular Greek dish, the chicken souvlaki. I often order from another restaurant but thought I would give Dinakis a try. Upon eating my chicken souvlaki skewer, I noticed the taste and texture of the chicken seemed off. To my surprise the chicken was raw in the middle. The restaurant was immediately called to inform them. They stated that we needed to contact skip for a refund (which is fine!) and said the chicken was raw due to how busy the restaurant was tonight. Unfortunately, I do not see this as a valid reason for serving undercooked meat. They offered to remake the meal and have me come and pick it up. Unfortunately with a baby in bed, leaving the house is not option which is why I ordered in.\n\nI’ll no longer be order from Dinakis.

Can't get this type of noodle in many places. Beef brisket was tough and not much flavor.

No base whatsoever.\n\nHand shredded chicken salad - extremely small. Most places that give smaller portions have expensive jellyfish in the salad. This place is only chicken and preserved vegetables so there is no need for it to be half the size of the plate, smaller than other specialty chef items.\n\nDeep fried chicken knees - giant pieces only to find out it is 80% batter. The garlic salt and spice just sat at the bottom and the chicken was never stirred with it.\n\nMinced pork fried glutinous rice dumpling - the glutinous rice wasnt very sweetened.

To start, we were served spoiled squid, which is completely unacceptable, especially for someone who is pregnant.\n\nAfter we told the server, they offered a discount as a form of compensation. However, when they got wind of our intention to report this incident to the health department, they shamefully retracted the discount. They said they are being generous and take our intention to report as a threat. Also, they emphasize that we have to be responsible for what we order, but we didn’t expect to get the spoiled food. To make matters worse, they even summoned the police to coerce us into paying the full amount. And they take away the dishes but never serve us a new one, so basically we paid full price for nothing.\n\nThis level of disregard for both customer well-being and basic ethics is inexcusable. It's disheartening to see such a blatant lack of responsibility and accountability from the management. I strongly advise anyone, especially those who are pregnant or have health concerns, to steer clear of this establishment.\n\nThe blatant disregard for food safety and the mistreatment of patrons is simply unacceptable.

Meats in the House Special Pho left a lot to be desired though. Not as much as I'd expect, half a beef ball, about 2 slices of beef steak, 3 slices of beef flank, tiny bits of beef tendon (which was really soft and delicious to my surprise), and a few bits of tripe here and there. Kinda disappointed with the amount of meat but as it was still pretty delicious,  I'll overlook it.\nIt comes with tea, beansprouts, basil leaves and lime on the side.\nRefer to pictures for more information!\n\nPrice:\n$10.24++/person\n\nService:\nNothing special.

Glad to see it's still here and I'm visiting again after 20+ years. All I remember was that I liked their hot and sour soup.\n\nNot really an authentic Szechuan restaurant. 30 years ago, most chinese cuisines were cooked by hong kongers or south chinese people. So, most of these dishes are going to be a southern take on it.\n\nHot and sour soup - price is awesome. $11 enough for at least 6 bowls. Souo base is missing a bit of flavor but it is jam packed with ingredients.\n\nDrunken chicken - it was ok. Little on the salty side.\n\nShanghainese pan fried pork buns - these were probably the worst I've had. Not made in house and not properly pan fried. No juice, super dry, no fried bottom crust.\n\nBean curd wrapped pork dim sum - surprisingly this came out last. At least 20 min has passed. This is a steamed dish but it came out with dried edges like it was sitting on a dry heater. Taste was ok.\n\nMapo tofu - asked for extra spicy and extra numbing. Numbing was there but nowhere near real szechuan numbing. Was not spicy at all. Sauce was more oily than saucey.\n\nThe price point reflects the quality. Things are either mediocre or a complete miss. Would come again to try only the better stuff. Staff was friendly. Came to try to refill the tea way more times than normal. The iron goddess tea tastes much better than a lot of dim sum places elsewhere."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOsyXtmZVjFTpSM7j5XHpsMqasJjiN51hrkn9sk\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c85358e6c767e95""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""Sarah Grace"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX0P_FT3n0HZdmLMDEJ6UcRFNPyHbE7QJ8GW3gOL-SGGTFh-sFdQw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good Chinese food, some of the best we’ve tried!

The staff took it back to warm it up, but that was just the beginning.\n\nI ordered a medium-rare steak, as I always do, but it came out rare. The meat was incredibly tough, making it almost impossible to cut and chew. On my first bite, I nearly choked and had to be helped by a nearby table. Shockingly, the manager didn’t seem to care about the situation at all. They simply removed the cost of the meal from the bill, without offering any real apology or concern.\n\nI was left struggling to breathe, and the only comment the manager made was, “You ordered a medium-rare steak.” I always order medium-rare, and I know the difference between rare, medium-rare, and medium. This steak was not only rare but also so tough that it was hard to cut in the first place!\n\nI am deeply disappointed with the lack of care or professionalism shown during this experience.

Toronto..\n\nLove and enjoy great views from the patio.\n\nFish and Fries - both of their batter and fries were overpowdered and little salty.

One was great with thick cut crunchy exterior and soft interior, other piece hasn't fully fried to perfection. It's greasy and less crispy.\n\nThe Downtowner Pizza - pleasantly surprised by the amazing flavor honey drizzle on pizza. The heat of the pizza then warm the honey as it mixed with the sauce and toppings.\n\nWings - no impressed.  Originally ordered with Honey garlic sauce toppings style.\nUnfortunately, wings were made with buffalo style and tasted like they half coated them with tobasco by mistaken.\n\nWe have to say they were by far some of the worst wings I have ever eaten.

weeknight for dinner. There was only us and 1 other table, but the delivery pickups were constant. On a rainy night, I can understand why.\n\nThe food is fresh, hot and delicious. Super comforting flavours.\n\nWhen delivery people arrived without their warming bag, staff would ask them to retrieve it. This ensured the food would stay warm.\n\nI would highly recommend the seasonal specialty, Khao Soi. This was our first time trying it, and I'd definitely order it again. This dish comes with crispy and soft noodles. When you stir it into the sauce, the fried noodles stay crispy, giving you an amazing combination of textures. Beautifully balanced and satisfying dish.\n\nWe also enjoyed the crispy wraps, chicken satay and Pa-Nang Curry.\n\nVery relaxing environment, and I'm glad we popped in. Chada Thai is a fantastic local Thai restaurant that has been in the community for many years."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOgs6Rb5cfnF84J2qgMTdFMob8BlMuzG2vmaGLv\u0026fid=0x0:0x2f614226fab6ab26""],""When"":""2024-11-2""},{""Name"":""Tiffany Yang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVTMFXTr99Nvibpsf_X84FJETCu3bBQbDSclTYmi4Zeid_pQeVX=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Absolutely scrumptious authentic Thai food!!!

We wished that the desserts were more varied - they were heavily matcha/red bean centered and on the less sweet side because of the Korean owned establishment. The teas were great, and service was good as well. The road in isn’t paved, so be aware. The tea room can be a little stuffy since it’s an open kitchen, but it didn’t bother us too much.

Each pizza was the perfect size to cut into 4 slices for sharing and we ended up ordering 4 different pizzas to try. The gnocchi was baked beautifully but the combo of cheese was too much for me but the rest of the table loved it! We also ordered the truffle risotto croquettes and it was my favourite dish.

Today we went and had a dish that tasted so awful we sent it back Immediately and were told we still had to pay for it because it’s our fault we didn’t like it…..then the manger had to argue with the “boss” and sent the male “boss” out to Yell at us two women in the restaurant which was the most disgusting and disrespectful experience ever. He even said well if you don’t pay for it I have too and not doing that……. Definitely the worst customer service I’ve ever seen or heard of. Unfortunately the food is not good anymore and the service 1000% worse. We have gone to other Asian restaurants for over 20 years and they would never treat anyone this way. We have always been treated like family in other establishments. A huge mistake ever supporting this restaurant with ownership or “bosses” like that. Save yourself money and the disrespect and go elsewhere."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Lily Choi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKDGk1BBw-1vgJ9ulxVR0Qxl5Y2TOzVCkO980S0Usi15HFveto=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Had lunch with friends total 3 people, ordered combo A and shrimp dim sum and eggplant dim sum, everything was good but not a big fan of chow mei with chicken because noodle was dry and did not have much flavour.

Highly recommended is their meatballs appetizers. They're HUGE and generous with the sauce! Good to feed 4 and I definitely suggest you use the bread to soak up all those sauce goodness. Their pasta also comes in generous portion, so you can always have enough leftover for tomorrow's lunch ;)\n\nIf you've been to Italy and you know how restaurants there usually have really good house wine on the cheap, this place also carries their house wine as well, though not as cheap as what you'd find in Italy. Therefore, might as well just get a whole bottle of wine. They'll put the stopper on and pack it up for you if you can't finish it there. We got the Ruffino and it went down pretty darn smooth.

Besides their No Reservations policy and having to wait 3hrs for seating..the service and meal was quite disappointing. Maybe it was just a bad kitchen nite...or the fact that they're closing down at the end of the month...but the venture just confirmed that I/we will never, ever wait for 3 or 2 or even less hrs for a table....no matter what the Restaurant hype is. We never had waited so long anytime, anywhere in all our dinning in all our travels here and abroad...and this restaurant certainly did Not live up to the wait. A wasted time. Plus the hostess 'list' her pad of paper with people's names on it...so after 3 hrs wait...she said \""whoever is next come in\"". What an operation. Anyway, we grabbed a table and the hostess was friendly enough took our order for wine. We ordered a bottle of Italian/Sicilian Rose which was pretty good...since they ran out of the house red by the carafe (tho I saw another table served it).. We then shared their version of Caprese salad...with tons of onions on it...something we've never seen before.. with small pieces of mozzarella .. Looked like dressed up left overs.. and then our pasta entres. My wife's   Fetucinni Alfredo wasn't too bad..decent flavor and consistency and pasta cooked correctly. My spaghetti Riviera with Rose sause was a little thin in consistency and mediocre in flavour. The portions were generous but service was poor. The host/waitress never once stopped by to ask how things were.... A real disappointment. With all the hype and previous good reviews makes me wonder about others expectations or Italian food...but we figured we'd give Rosa's a shot before they close and retire.

Despite being entrusted with the education of my five sons, the teachers seemed indifferent and unengaged.\n\nThe curriculum appeared outdated and uninspiring, failing to capture the attention of my children. It felt like a struggle to get them excited about learning, as the school failed to offer any innovative or engaging teaching methods.\n\nFurthermore, the facilities were lackluster at best. Cramped classrooms, outdated technology, and a general lack of upkeep were glaring issues. It's disheartening to see my sons' potential stifled by an environment that lacks the resources needed to foster growth and development.\n\nIn summary, Mountain Meadows School has been a regrettable choice for my children's education.

The service was friendly.\nI had a blackberry \u0026 brie grilled cheese, a vegan rye cookie, and a tropical espresso spritz (seasonal drink, like an espresso tonic with coconut and pineapple flavours). Everything was really good! I love fruit with brie cheese so the grilled cheese was an easy winner for me. The blackberry spread was tart and jammy which balanced out the rich brie cheese. I loved the funky flavour of rye in the cookie and the chewiness. The espresso spritz was very refreshing in this hot weather! It had deflated a little by the time I took the picture, but it had an impressively foamy crema layer.

The setting is absolutely stunning—nestled right by the waterfront, it’s the perfect spot to enjoy a meal while soaking in the beautiful views of the harbor.\n\nI ordered the 2-piece cod, and while the batter was a touch soggy by the time I got to it, the overall quality of the dish was still commendable. The cod itself was fresh and perfectly cooked, with a flaky texture that paired well with the flavorful batter. Even with the slight sogginess, the taste didn’t disappoint, and I could tell that the ingredients used were of high quality.\n\nThe portions were generous, and the classic combination of fish and chips hit the spot. The fries were crisp and well-seasoned, complementing the fish nicely. What really makes Pajo’s stand out, though, is the atmosphere—there’s something special about enjoying your meal with the gentle breeze from the water and the scenic backdrop of Rocky Point Park.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Pajo’s to anyone looking for a classic fish and chips experience in a relaxed, picturesque setting.

I’ve been looking for authentic Chinese food restaurant like this in Coquitlam especially with spicy cuisine but also the typical noodles, dumplings, etc… I was told the chef is from more northern China and the lady helped us is from Guang Dong and they have been in the restaurant business for decades, I didn’t ask too much about their stories but all I know is this is their newest adventure! I am glad!!!! I see people order for take outs and some people even order everyday but from 7:15 to 9:30 on a Saturday, there were only 4 dine in tables including us, so they do not have extra servers, which is totally understandable… therefore if you are looking for services like cactus club, it’s not going to happen any time soon… nonetheless, I rate the service 10/10 for their friendliness and knowledge of the food, suggestions, the only reason why I give 4 star on google is because I want to stay true to what to expect for the next customers, atmosphere is 3/5 because it is a little dated but to some people this could be a 5/5.. nostalgic feeling! Overall, this is a must try and if you are a local, you might make this restaurant a regular thing… I am going back to try more dishes! Everything we ordered were amazing! Not overly salty or oily and packed with the right amount of spices without being too spicy, we did ask for mild spice. 10/10 for food!

From the moment my wife and I walked in, we were greeted with warm hospitality and a cozy ambiance. The star of our dining experience, however, was undoubtedly our fantastic waitress, Jacoba. Her attentive and friendly service truly enhanced our evening.\n\nOne of the highlights of our visit to Scratch Kitchen was undoubtedly the pizza. The moment our pizzas arrived at our table, we knew we were in for a treat. The flavors were out of this world, and the attention to detail was evident in every bite. The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside while remaining delightfully chewy on the inside. Each slice was generously topped with high-quality ingredients, creating a medley of flavors that danced on our taste buds.\n\nWhat impressed us even more was the restaurant's commitment to catering to different dietary preferences. My wife, being a vegan, was thrilled to find a variety of options tailored to her needs. Her vegan pizza was a masterpiece in itself, with a delectable combination of plant-based cheeses, fresh vegetables, and a flavorful tomato sauce. It's not easy to find vegan pizzas that taste this good, and Scratch Kitchen exceeded our expectations.\n\nBeyond the exceptional food, the atmosphere at Scratch Kitchen was warm and inviting. The rustic decor and cozy seating added to the overall charm of the restaurant. The staff members were attentive and friendly, and it was evident that they took pride in providing a memorable dining experience for their guests.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Scratch Kitchen to anyone seeking a remarkable dining experience. Whether you're a pizza lover or have specific dietary preferences, this restaurant caters to a variety of tastes and will leave you craving more. Make sure to request Jacoba as your waitress for exceptional service. With its phenomenal pizzas, commitment to dietary options, and inviting atmosphere, Scratch Kitchen truly stands out as a culinary gem."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOK0K5gpP7ptzf4xbCBZ-G_2uArYscd_dPS7qzs\u0026fid=0x0:0x5b0831c3c22b0f30""],""When"":""2023-6-1""},{""Name"":""Adele Barnett"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJlKeNpkF3-ajmNXl3fkiMG0jQqNqTy_pscUNVSFDGdQdanzA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We love Scratch Kitchen! First of all they’re at Dollarton Village so parking is never an issue. The restaurant indoor outdoor seating is so comfortable. The tables are nicely spaced so that you don’t feel like you’re sitting on top of each other. We are always very warmly welcomed by our name every time we are there. And we know some of their names too; Eric, Devin, Jacoba, Danielle. Sorry we can’t name everyone. Whether you order their fabulous pizzas which ARE made from scratch, or their delicious share plates, salads or bowls, there’s something for everyone whether you’re a meat eater or vegetarian. It’s a lovely neighbourhood restaurant, which means we bump into our neighbour friends as well. Sometimes we keep to ourselves, and other times our friends join us. We love Scratch Kitchen.

On a weekday afternoon, there were a few tables, but definitely not super busy. They have quite a lot of seating from along the window, to the bar, and high tops too. I liked the light fixtures and plants along the wall.\n\nWe decided on getting the fried chicken, a mushroom, and a brussel sprout pizza. The fried chicken was plated nicely and smelled amazing. The chicken was crisp and still very tender on the inside. I just wish it was a tad crisper on the  outside. I loved the pairing with grainy mustard, honey, and pickles. It was a well balanced dish and definitely something I would order again. The pizzas arrived and they're quite large. The crust looked and tasted good. It had doughiness and a crispness. I liked the brussel sprout pizza. It was a mix of sweet and savoury. The onion jam added a nice sweetness along with the honey. The added walnuts gave a nice crunch. I hadn't had a pizza like this before and was glad I tried it. Also, you can ask for chili oil. I thought it would come in a bottle that I could just drizzle on. However, it came in a little container with actual pieces of chilis in the oil. I really liked this and it added a nice kick to my pizza.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with my meal. Service was fantastic and makes me want to come back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO5AF5MTpk5VGLmEQEpPWoBTrl9vaHkdwXG8I3-\u0026fid=0x0:0x5b0831c3c22b0f30""],""When"":""2019-3-1""}]",
