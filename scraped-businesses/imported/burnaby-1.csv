I've been searching for a good Katsu Don in Vancouver, so I looked it up on Yelp and found this place nearby.\n\nSurprisingly, this restaurant seems to be genuinely Japanese-managed rather than Chinese. The venue is clean and tidy, and the waitress served me politely with a big smile, reminiscent of restaurants in Japan.\n\nIn my opinion, the Katsu Don is a 3.5/5. The rice portion is just right (about 1/4 cup, if you're familiar with rice cookers, you know what I mean). The pork cutlets with egg topping were decent, in the traditional Katsu Don style. The sauce was a bit salty but still acceptable. I'm not sure if it would be juicier if I dined in, as my pork cutlets were a bit dry inside, though the coating was still crispy and tasty.\n\nThe miso soup was tastier than the usual powdered versions. It included tofu, which added to the flavor and made the soup more enjoyable.\n\nThe 9-piece California roll was decent and worth the price.\n\nI will try again next time and see if dining in makes a difference."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMLiATEpTI21zBp9NbhYaNaXXP1fsfDDstLl5e4\u0026fid=0x0:0x87560d80f0c4d107""],""When"":""2024-7-30""},{""Name"":""Ellen Sun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKkjdruPSIFv65dsKIMMRNGR-izc6K1STFginUcbAMqwRUvOLA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Honestly one of my favourite go-to sushi places.

Staff was polite and gave us great recommendations as it was our first time. The ambiance is very casual (typically Vietnamese place), but also quite clean.\n\nWe ordered the Frog Legs (fish sauce), Special Crab Soup and Lobster Tomato Soup - supposedly the 3 most popular items. The frog legs were fried well, having a nice crunch, not very oily and the meat was cooked perfectly. I will admit, I found it a bit too salty, but you get used to it and the pickled vegetables helped balance the flavour with acidity. It’s not that common to find frog legs within Vancouver from my experience, so I’d definitely recommend trying this - its relatively similar to chicken in terms of flavour. The special crab soup was probably my favourite of the two soups. The deep fried soft shelled crab was a nice touch and tasted like what you’d expect. The soup didn’t taste too fishy, but had a subtle seafood flavour and I appreciated the chunks of crab meat. It was my first time having tapioca noodles and they have a great chewy texture - I’m a fan. Lastly, we had the lobster tomato soup. Lobster was cooked well and presentation looked good, but I felt besides that it was quite average. Being that it’s a $32 bowl of noodles, they could’ve made the soup have a stronger flavour, it really tasted like a mild port tomato soup. There was really nothing to rave about.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good. It gave me a nicer viet restaurant vibe but I felt I paid for it through their prices as it is pricier than your typical Vietnamese lunch. I will admit we did order more of the specialty items and portions are definitely enough to make you full, but I think that’s what makes B\u0026D stand out. If you come here, I’d definitely try the more unique items that you don’t find at every restaurant like the frog legs. I’ll be returning to try more of their items, but expect your bill to be around $40-50 per person depending on what you order."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPWI5xDmP1Co3ONQGQ0tK18ajgrRFAqpwNRuX7N\u0026fid=0x0:0xab40477bd079a0fb""],""When"":""2024-8-20""},{""Name"":""S J"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFJgtQsTx2GqIorZzdULLXPFX8yaR7DrYrRftNOfTGqwP15U2i=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The lobster tomato soup was delicious, and the crab balls were the highlight!

Otherwise, I will be talking about my experiences and will base my rating on the 3 categories (food, service, environment/atmosphere)\n\nWhen walking into the restaurant, it was very tight and compact. No more than 6-7 people can fit inside, hence the seats outside and behind the restaurant. Restaurant holds the 50s theme inside and uses an old milkshake mixing machine, which was a nice touch. No washroom available, so make sure you have something to clean your hands with.\n\nService was neutral, nothing much to talk about. We order, wait, get the food, and eat. Honestly, it doesn't make a memorable experience, but my expectations weren't high.\n\nThe food, however, impressed me. Thick cut grandma fries were alright, and some don't maintain crispness for a long period of time. The LA burger, on the other hand, was very nice. Housemade bun held all the ingredients together and did not crumble. The patty was nicely seasoned and had the grill char flavor. The mushrooms, bacon,cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes combined nicely offer a perfectly balanced burger. One tiny gripe I had was that my burger had more mustard than anticipated.\n\nWhen it came down to the milkshake, I was thoroughly impressed. Perfect balance of sweetness, and you can taste the ice cream, milk, and then the strawberry. Simply amazing!\n\nBefore I left, I decided to try the bulldog. It was alright, but bun held everything together but proved to be messy to consume. The amount of mustard added was again too much, and other than the sausage (which was nice and had a nice slight char smoky flavor and the casing pops) was all I tasted. I'm not too impressed with it compared to the burger.\n\nOverall, it's an impressive burger spot and definitely hits the spot if you are looking for a quality burger. Probably would recommend eating on an outside table, bringing your own hand wipes, and don't expect an amazing customer service from the establishment. Would definitely come back if im passing by Burnaby and craving a burger and milkshake. Would recommend to friends and family!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMIBne7BGJ3CNIClra2Ro7WSbGEfh_-nPuxW2q5\u0026fid=0x0:0xdbb9c8827a53dea9""],""When"":""2024-3-25""},{""Name"":""Elie Khoueiry"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX5oURLERNdcm9BvIr3fAC4qFZbtajTkrn7lvmppBB64F0YQgE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Honestly this place went down in service and quality very quickly.

husband, my parents and I went here for dinner for the first time.  The food is pretty good and well priced. The service is horrible. It took 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table after we were seated and that’s only because I hailed someone down and asked if we would be served. When bringing our mains our plates from our appies were not cleared. I had to tell them to clear it so that the mains could fit. I also had to advise them to bring out new cutlery. It’s unfortunate that I had to provide significant direction for what I feel is basic service.  At the end when we finished eating was the only time the server came to us and asked if everything was good and if we needed anything.\n\nFood we ordered:\n\nPapdi Chaat was 9/10\n\nSamosa Chana Chaat was 8.5/10\n\nChicken 65 saucy version was 4/10. It was described as medium hot and the server said she would ask the cook to make it less spicy. It came out very spicy and we have a high spice tolerance…\n\nRav Masala Dosa was 8.5/10\n\nRav Mys Onion Paneer Masala Dosa 8/10 (it’s heavy)\n\nJust an fyi the Rav dosa are the only ones that are crispy.\n\nMango Lassi  9/10\n\nThe somber (I might be spelling it wrong) that comes with the Dosa for dipping was 7/10. It’s tomato based which is not something I’m not used too. Eating it with the dosa was good. Eating it on its own was ok. They provide refills.\n\nOverall, the food here is pretty good."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMwno_GJJTfOLIgqp0iBsmXCae-SNxM16KQtyQ7\u0026fid=0x0:0xd869064e8d58ea75""],""When"":""2024-8-18""},{""Name"":""Deb PS"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX2JrjvxBJWPrjHCwBxV9NiRybb9V5GJpynDBuSW5sd6snYZiMa=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Visited tonight as I was craving chicken biryani. Manjal’s food is so tasty and delicious. Tonight I noticed that the restaurant was packed. I ordered the chicken biryani 65 which is much hotter than the regular chicken biryani.  The servers told me that they just wouldn’t add green peppers to it and it was great for me. I don’t like when food is so hot that your mouth is burning rather than enjoying the taste. The chicken biryani 65 without the green peppers was just perfect, they also gave another sauce and raita to go along with it.  If I wanted it hotter, I could’ve just added the other sauce. It’s not actually a hot sauce but a biryani sauce I had takeout tonight, but I was reading other reviews that talked about how terrible the service was. the cashiers tonight were very friendly and helpful and had big smiles on their faces. I know that this isn’t always the case.  Also, in my opinion, sometimes in these more authentic restaurants, the service may not be the same as what you would expect in a Canadian or American food restaurant so if you want something, just ask for it.   It looks like they have recently upgraded the decor as well as I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. It is a good place for families together and I did notice a lot of Indian customers so that is a good sign."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPiTSipW4e_leg8Dm1Hzz2Cy8SXRdgaapKa8z2Y\u0026fid=0x0:0xd869064e8d58ea75""],""When"":""2024-9-7""},{""Name"":""Jasmine Feng"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUhfTWkaOSn2EjKlPr8c4VLtzH6WYopbB6Nfh9GsOFmt92-1jHu=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We were craving South Indian food, so we tried this place out on a day trip to the Vancouver area.

is based heavily on the outstanding service that my family received when we went here for lunch and I think that goes beyond any dish I can order or any booth I can sit in. It was our first time coming to this location as it was the easiest for us and my niece and were able to order some easy lunch specials. From 11 to 2 they have lunch specials and then after that is happy hour until five I believe but they also have their menu online which is great to see beforehand. We ordered the crispy onion burger, the warm pastrami sandwich and the chicken clubhouse and they all came with fries. The dishes were flavourful and filling. Good portion and price was average for the specials (14-19$). The place is kind of more casual and its nature and half of the seats were filled with males drinking so they have a mixture of booth seating and table tops. There was only one server at the time and she was definitely working so hard and kindly to get everyone what they needed. The owner also came out and assisted, but in particular, he was so very kind to my niece and just very empathetic towards our table. I am so grateful for genuine service and anyone that takes care of my family wins my loyalty."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOb4L71NGRdU-dB49lCYrdg2Mjm4W-2B7O9RFNW\u0026fid=0x0:0xb366ecf4f28cbbc3""],""When"":""2024-12-5""},{""Name"":""Mia Duong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUPAUy0Htbh5FTHA7CrcyalmfPE1fNra4l4o1y3j6EQjpz6Sdhn=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Love coming here for Wings special on Wednesdays and Sundays where a pound of wings cost $13.99 with the additional purchase of a refillable soft drink $3.75 or $4 ice tea.

That or go straight into take outs and temporary quick bite dine-ins instead of full on restaurant.\n\nThe thing about running a business, especially a small business, is that when one can't really afford to provide something good to the customer, it will come through very quickly and the business will lose more business - at an exponential rate. It just gives customers a feeling of cheapness and that is deadly to a business.\n\nOne important thing to note is the Edmonds area isn't particularly high class living and people here put value above all else - sometimes even taste. Although rent is getting higher and higher, a business should still not show cheapness or else best to open in a location with more affordable rent.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I would have recommended this place as a hidden gem, but now it is more or less holding onto its future potentials of recovery by a thread."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNuV4Dcij_DBaXx2Bztt7-n_EHECZLsOpHyYCUP\u0026fid=0x0:0x670333b76cdb15f8""],""When"":""2022-8-16""},{""Name"":""Farzam"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIooZPCPPfH5D4G1f5pX_06Fqf4UZb5reyqU1DQAFjZqgdcZ04=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Great Food for order or take out!

And maybe the most packed restaurant I've ever seen in the tricities with the best vibe! A hidden gem if there ever was one, complete with 4 pool tables, shuffleboard, air hockey, darts and an arcade! The beer and food was wicked, and we lucked into a steak dinner special! I loved every inch of this place. From the shape of the bar to the stage for live music. The potential is off the charts and I highly recommend a visit.

Should've ordered two of these. Every time I've ordered intestines, I always think I like bung more. Don't get me wrong. Both are heavy. I think I just like the taste and crispy texture of bung more. Don't think I like the gop in gopchang. Not sure what that is. Fat in intestines? I dunno. The old-school Korean tonkatsu was Surprisingly good. It was big and crispy.  We demolished this first. It was a good drinking food for sure. Us ladies were very hungry or something so we decided to order an additional seafood tofu soup. This tofu soup wasn't particularly outstanding. It was fine. It was spicy. Wished it had more tofu. It didnt beat the house Tofu down the street imo, but you don't come here for the tofu soup so don't listen to me. I think this is the second time I've come here makchang/bung and it didn't disappoint. Apparently this restaurant used to be hangang on Austin but it moved here? I remember hangang used to have good makchang/bung so I'm glad they kept their quality. Anyway. I kinda missed loud/dim Korean drinking places on north road from like 10-15 years ago lol.

The egg is cooked to perfection—soft and runny, yet holding its shape, creating an indulgent texture that melts in your mouth. Topped with a generous portion of sauce, this dish is a harmonious balance of rich flavors and creamy textures, making it a must-try.\n\nThe Kimchi Cheese Udon is another dish that deserves special mention. It’s simple but absolutely delicious, especially when served piping hot. The salty cheese and sweet kimchi blend together to form an incredible flavor profile that keeps you coming back for more. And if you can’t finish it in one sitting, it’s great to take home and pair with some rice, as the dish often has an abundance of cheese and kimchi left over after the udon is gone.\n\nOverall, Green Leaf Sushi offers a delightful and unique experience, proving that it’s not just about sushi—it’s a place where even pasta and rice dishes can shine."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNzokYKxFdAFcXDYSqnY0UjQ3doAZLiWlOMnluu\u0026fid=0x0:0xf17d5c35330d7c16""],""When"":""2024-9-29""},{""Name"":""Devi C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIVGQckEvlyJkeQEJFuTg1VQJmMMvwWg5ldGYfQkiJC3QjqGQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Ordered the Mentaiko linguine, tornado egg, aburi platter.

originally and we don’t have any Korean buffets, so this was a real treat.

Was really looking forward to trying Korean buffet as there aren’t many in metro Vancouver. Plenty of hot pot and regular buffets. The service was good. The only reason for the three star rating was strictly on my experience dining at 7:30 pm. Their cut off time is 8 pm for closure of 9 pm on weekdays. However I did not expect the food to not be refreshed (I guess understandably given there weren’t any more guests after me.)\n\nGreat variety of Korean dishes and I especially liked the beef bone broth (very hearty and seems like real boiled beef bones. Nutritious) along with the kimchi fried rice (good flavour).\n\nThe only thing was the grilled meats were all cold when I arrived. Also, the pasta and rice cakes were looking pretty sad so I didnt even try it.\n\nThe fried fish was delicious but there was literally only one small slice left. The bugogi was freshly made on request but admittedly sub par; the beef is too thinly slice and since it’s likely frozen the texture was rather powdery. The salmon had a bitter aftertaste for some reason.  And the Korean fried chicken is the highlight but because it was likely out for some time, it was very soggy though the seasoning was nice.\n\nThe service was great and friendly. No problems there. The price is good as well\n\nI guess just take this review to note that you MUST go early if you want fresh and hot food. Else I felt like I was eating cold left overs. It’s my fault; I had intended to come at 5:45 pm but got held up and arrived at around 7:45 pm. Didn’t expect the food to be cold though.\n\nWould try again and frequent regularly but it’s an hour from where I am so the time cost for two hours doesn’t make it worth while except the once in a blue moon to fill cravings for Korean food. Great variety though and has good potential if the food is hot and fresh. Didn’t see the cheesecake till looking at my pictures lol (and ended up taking a stroll by Korean town to H-Mart and Hannuen Market to get some Korean bread and cheesecake after. Speaking of which, you can walk by Korean town after you eat to burn some calories and see the other restaurant and cafes)\n\nWould probably try the lunch buffet next time as it’s only 25.99 to see the difference."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPJCETovXUDFpAHlCI9StAT6D1-yy0Jrhpoi6hh\u0026fid=0x0:0x8e75bc21ed381e20""],""When"":""2024-10-14""},{""Name"":""Nick (Neek)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV1vFxY7J8TeGvCzfbDb-8G1ZKZ5NRu0re3I-xGPfKYIH_u9Mgytw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We went right at 11:30am when the buffet opened in order to get the freshest food. We went on a weekday for brunch, and the price was around $28. This price can vary depending on the day you go, as well as whether you're going for brunch or dinner. The restaurant was very clean and spacious inside, with very attentive staff - which was really nice. There was a good variety of foods to choose from, including meats, side dishes, condiments, and desserts. My favorites were the pork belly, pork katsu,  kimchi fried rice, and Korean fried chicken. It's all very tasty and fresh. For 3 people, we paid about $90 in total, so expect $30 per person for the brunch buffet. Overall, it is a decent price for really good food and very friendly staff.

The inari with tuna and kimbap was really good. I loved the rosé pasta with seafood (such a random thing I wasn’t expecting to find, but it was actually so good) the fried chicken was probably the highlight for me and fried rice was also good!

The highlight of the food for me was the fried chicken.  Also I quite enjoyed their japchae and the variety of soups that they had especially the beef radish soup and fish cake soup.  They also have a drink fountain that had Sujeonggwa (traditional Korean cinnamon \u0026 ginger drink) and it was very cinnamon-ly.\n\nOverall it was a very good dinner.  The food is constantly refilled and the servers are attentive to removing your plates and refiling your water/tea.  However if you cannot eat a lot like me and struggle to eat 2+ plates then I would suggest not going for dinner as it is around $40.  Do lunch as it is cheaper ($28) however I'm not sure if the food selection is the same as dinner but assume it isn't.\n\nWill be back for lunch for another special occasion."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMUFslpKKlQmlzk1KadZhFygxk8jEI3tyGqo6ZH\u0026fid=0x0:0x8e75bc21ed381e20""],""When"":""2024-11-26""},{""Name"":""Cat King"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVs0w4Gi6wbbwHozHIMXCxGOYXWgHMRV7NGZtPTmRmCUIubsOlj=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We dropped by Secret Garden with my sister's family, my parents, My MIL, and my family. We actually heard that Secret Garden wasn't as good as people hoped, so we didnt really have high expectations.  Still, Secret Garden has been on our families' to-try-list for a while, so we finally came. It's quite hard to find a restaurant that can Accommodate 11 people without a reservation. However, Secret Garden did have space for us. The restaurant actually had lots of space for many more guests. We paid about 40 bucks per person, 35-ish for seniors, and children under two or something I think was free. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed their food. Their fried stuff was fried really well. Their fried chicken was pretty good. Fried fish was pretty good. None of their fried  Stuff was soggy. They had good choices of Korean soup. They had other meats and some dessert options (Ice cream, small little cake bites, fruit ) It's been a while since I've been to a buffet, so I personally didn't know too much whether or not this was a good one, But I had a good experience overall perhaps because I was with my family. Family time is always good, so yeah. But my sister, who is visiting from out of town, she said that her and her kids enjoyed the food here. She said the food was clean. Anyway. I personally like having variations whenever I eat, so I enjoyed the experience at Secret Garden. The only thing they could use is perhaps a soft drinks dispenser or something. maybe there was one, but I couldn't find it. I wouldn't mind coming back again with my family later.

and Delicious Food with Minor Shortcomings\n\nOur experience was exceptional overall. While they don’t accept reservations on weekends and operate on a walk-in basis, the hostess went above and beyond to accommodate our group and ensure we were comfortable.\n\nThe soy-marinated crab was exquisitely tender and perfectly balanced in flavor—an absolute standout dish. In contrast, the spiced crab fell short; it lacked the same depth of flavor and tenderness, suggesting it may not have undergone the same meticulous marination process.\n\nThe two meat dishes we tried—soy-marinated pork jowl and beef—were flawless. Both were tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor.\n\nThe green onion salad was another highlight. It was perfectly seasoned without being overpowering, making it a refreshing complement to the main dishes.\n\nHowever, the side dishes were underwhelming. Having lived and traveled extensively in Korea, I feel Jejudo could elevate this aspect to better reflect authentic Korean dining standards.\n\nThe restaurant’s renovation is stunning, with upscale lighting and a modern, inviting interior. The washrooms were impressively clean and well-maintained, with the inclusion of an all-gender washroom standing out as a progressive and thoughtful touch.\n\nPricing is reasonable, especially considering the generous portions of sides and salads. Expect to spend $30-40 per person, which feels like great value for the quality. Don’t forget to order rice and a side of lettuce (often included).\n\nDespite a few minor critiques, this is a solid 5-star experience. The food, service, and atmosphere make it a standout spot, and I’m far more impressed than not."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPPLVuN49j9YUcLSgMuhhHGRbpqJvtY1DxpaMt7\u0026fid=0x0:0xf07718804d2751b""],""When"":""2024-12-8""},{""Name"":""Scott Lee"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXHpW7vGME__Zs4wKjXR04Upnw88bkVVyz-H2288JsHocq9vI3r=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Recently renovated with the same fantastic food and service!

What made me angry and prompted me to leave this review is that when my friends and I told the staff that the bottom of the pizza we ordered was completely burnt, they took the remaining slices and remade a new one for us. It was better than before, and we each ate one slice, leaving three slices to take away. However, when I got home and opened the box, I found that the three slices inside looked exactly like those in the picture.

It's similar to cheese bread in a Brazilian steakhouse.\nPros: It is Serbian food, try it if you haven't already.

It was super delicious and hands down some of the best charcoal bbq chicken. They had an option to add toppings as well to customize the charcoal bbq as well. Each table has an ipad where you order from and honestly I have no idea how they brought out our food so fresh and hot so quick. One of the fastest services I have received at an asian restaurant.

When we left at 11:30 the whole restaurant was basically full. They serve everything in the carts. There's some things that they won't have in the carts which then they will tell you to tick off on the paper to order it.\n\nWe ordered steamed beef trip in special sauce ($9.28), steamed rice flour roll with scallops and seaweed ($9.88), deep fried sesame balls ($8.58), deep fried milk custard ($8.58), pork and shrimp dumpling shao mai ($8.38), har gao ($8.38), deep fried taro ($8.38), steamed pork ribs ($7.88). Tea is $1.50 each person\n\nThe steamed beef tripe in special sauce had a strong tripe flavour in a good way. You could taste the innards flavour. Some restaurants bleach it and clean it really well so that you can taste it but this place has cleaned it just enough. Flavour was good and I would order this again\n\nRice roll with seaweed and scallops. There were slices of scallops throughout the rice roll. This rice roll is different from the rice rolls you usually have at dimsum. It's not chewy like the ones you find at other restaurants. Instead it's really smooth and has a slight rice flavour. According to my grandma, this is the way it's meant to be. The ones that are chewy and bouncy is the new way of doing it now. This one is based on personal preference. If you like traditional style, this is the way to go.\n\nDeep fried sesame balls were not too sweet on the inside but the outside was too thick (also not chewy enough) and it wasn't crispy enough outside. We found out later that they have a different kind that's the thinner one. This one is pushed out on carts and not on the sheet so be warned if you are looking for the thin skin one.\n\nThe shrimp dumplings or har gao were okay. Lots of shrimp inside and very bouncy but the outside skin was a tad too thick\n\nThe taro fried dumpling was not crispy and flaky enough for me. The inside filling was pretty decent\n\nThe pork shrimp shao mai dumpling was pretty good. Lots of pork little shrimp which is how it should be. It had a good bite too it and was well flavored\n\nThe pork ribs were not bad. Meat was soft and portion was big.\n\nThe fried milk dessert was interesting and definitely not what we were expecting. You drink the milk custard that's inside. Outside is crispy but also not hot. Inside was cold as well. Interesting but would only order it once.\n\nOverall dimsum was not bad. They have dishes here you might not find elsewhere. No major faults. Some of the servers pushing the carts can be a bit pushy. They try to sell you the dishes that have been sitting their the longest. Other than that the other servers are really nice and fast. They have servers specifically just to pour tea and get the bill. Would I recommend it? Probably not as none of the dishes stand out. But if you are looking for some solid run of the mill dimsum. Then this place is actually not bad"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM1tvlOPgZI5PxQuBlntgi8oH6pyxBURp5_JQhA\u0026fid=0x0:0xfd47f510a0877b4b""],""When"":""2024-5-2""},{""Name"":""Anjstacansi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXxfxd7NedIKrSKbEThR9bCPUg8DXPAGue7SfEQVr5kqeRxyA8a=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Me and my family loved it.

the intent of comparing the food to another Taiwanese restaurant that serves similar dishes called “The One”. Talking about MYST specifically I really liked that they had large screens so that you can watch sports games. Service was quick and attentive, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was pretty good in terms of the food. I had the deep fried squid which was quite flavourful and the deep fried chicken nuggets, which was also coated in a similar seasoning. I was mostly interested in the beef noodle soup as that is what I was comparing to the one. To be completely honest, they’re both good in their own ways however the soup broth at MYST felt a little more bland. Still flavourful and tasty however, just not as much flavour as the broth from the one I was also not asked if I wanted my soup to be spicy or not. I’m not sure if this means that they don’t offer spicy broth or if you just have to ask for it. I also had a bubble tea, which was tasty although very sweet overall I enjoyed my visit at MYST."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPa-HrkvgrcekV6JRSnMjyDCZ72nerodqyOQ2wm\u0026fid=0x0:0x7f74631ddc94861a""],""When"":""2024-12-3""},{""Name"":""Suina Tachibana"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLTPrVqFhXEOaoro_YekrFMLthhW9v59uu_aZukNc2gobun-w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It is our first time eating in Myst.

Unlike other times, I came with my husband for dinner this time.\n\nWe are well aware that their portion is quite big, so we agreed to order some food to share. Taiwanese style pork knuckle, fried rice noodles with veggie and shredded pork and a soup with meat balls.\n\nThe pork knuckle is so so. It's quite tender but the flavor is rather mild. Perhaps that's the whole point of having a sauce with it. The sauce did enhance the flavor and made the pork knuckles more enticing. Among the food we ordered, my favorite is the fried rice noodle. It might look very plain and not that appealing in photo, but its very aromatic and flavorful. The magic came from the dried shrimps. They totally took the dish to a different level. The soup tasted like what it supposed to be. No surprise, bad or good.\n\nMyst is one of the restaurants that you can go for a late night meal coz it closes around midnight from Sunday to Thursday.

Their specialty dishes, such as the Mango Tango Sushi Roll and the Pad Thai with a twist, are not to be missed. The presentation of each dish is simply stunning; vibrant colors and artistic arrangements elevate the dining experience to a whole new level.\n\nOne of my favorites was the house special, the Szechuan Spicy Chicken, which was perfectly balanced with just the right amount of heat. Every bite was a burst of flavor, and you can really taste the quality of the ingredients used.\n\nThe history of Myst Asian Fusion adds to its charm. Founded by a passionate team of culinary experts with roots in various Asian cultures, they aim to share authentic flavors while also putting their own unique spin on traditional dishes.\n\nThe restaurant operates daily from 11 AM to 12 PM, making it convenient for both lunch, dinner and late time visits.

Our server Leopold warned us that the carpaccio was vegetarian and we verbally acknowledged that we understood.\n\nThe ciders came out by the pint for $6 as a deal and we were delighted. The carbonation was mild but the service was quick. The carpaccio came out and it looked unappetizing but we proceeded, and to our displeasure we indulged. After one bit each we choked down the food and politely told the server that it wasn’t to our taste. We asked for the bill and finished our drinks.\n\nCredit where it’s due, Leopold was a good server and he even cooped the food we didn’t eat. We appreciate the gesture and have nothing negative to say about the service. Perhaps it was that night or maybe that item is a flop on the menu. But it really wasn’t good.

This is a review of their $49 dineout menu:\n1) Lobster Bisque - good flavour, a tiny bit salty for my taste but I am also a bit sensitive to salty stuff.\n2) Beef carpaccio - I was worried this would be too dressed up (I’ve had a similar type of beef carpaccio that didn’t sit well with me because there was too many toppings piled on it) but this one wasn’t bad, the toppings weren’t overkill which I liked. The meat could’ve been a bit more flavourful itself however but overall it was better than I was anticipating.\n3) Braised short rib Paparadelle: the portion was huge which was great, I got to take some home for lunch the next day. I was sort of expecting the pasta to taste more homemade, but it definitely just tasted like dried packaged pasta. However, there was a ton of meat which in my opinion made it worth of value, and the dish was flavourful enough in my opinion. Weirdly though the food wasn’t really hot when it came, which didn’t fully bother me because I could eat it right away, but that might bother others. Overall I thought it was quite decent.\n4) Scallop risotto: the rice tasted a tad bit undercooked and not as seasoned as I hoped? My friend had to add salt to it. I didn’t try any of the scallops so I can’t speak for those.\n5) Cannoli Trio: out of everything the dessert was the winner. My friend ordered the cheesecake (although I didn’t try), but she really liked it. I also really liked the Cannolis, the cream inside was really tasty and didn’t taste fake at all.\n\nService was just ok. Had to ask to get my water filled and it took a while before they got to it/remembered. Servers weren’t overly friendly or anything but they weren’t rude either. My friend thought it took a lot of time for each course to come but it didn’t bother me too much as I was okay chatting and digesting a little.\n\nOverall not the worst dineout I’ve had before, I’ve gone to some hotel restaurants for dineout Vancouver in the past that were very average. This was not bad for a $49 price point. I’d give a solid 4 stars."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPejmj_J4fInM1MK9nP6UO3Nikk91RbVIz6XEXi\u0026fid=0x0:0x2e98a3929a97b700""],""When"":""2024-1-30""},{""Name"":""Helen Lu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKvlD2THS7P8b_vT3p9ZoN6oXc4IbvekW-nLHk-BxCQibirlg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Came here for the Bite of Burnaby three course meal for $42.

My table tried to order for over 20 minutes. We left after sipping on water for 40 minutes.\n\nIt looked like there was 1 sever for the whole restaurant on a Saturday evening during the holiday season. None of the employees seemed particularly glad to be there. The hostess was rude to the final member of our party when she arrived, demanding that she have a reservation when she told her that her party was already seated. Even when she was able to clear things up with the hostess, the hostess gave her attitude that \""Being already inside is not the same as having a reservation\"".\n\nSurprisingly, the 1 server didn't look busy or hurried, but she also didn't look over at our table once even though she visited tables near us and we were seated in her eyeline when she was at the bar. In over 30 minutes that I sat at the table, the server didn't come over once to check if we wanted any drinks or to get anything started. We tried staring at her when she was at a table nearby, politely raising our hand and keeping it there, and then finally waving our hands in the air like survivors on an island. We caught the attention of many other diners there, but somehow missed the server. Finally, the busser noticed us and came over to our table. We said that we wanted to order, and he called, \""Angeline, they want to order,\"" and walked away.\n\nWe were relieved until we saw her go to the table of five seniors next to us instead, who didn't seem concerned with ordering. The seniors took a long time to ask questions about the menu, and my table kept watching the server and raising our hands to try to get her attention, so she'd know to visit us next. We were exasperated and starting to get worried about the rest of the dining experience: maybe the kitchen is shortstaffed and our orders would take forever if they are rung after a table of five. Maybe the server would take equally long just to fetch some condiments even if we did somehow manage to order and get our food. When she was done with the table of five, she went back over to the bar without as much as a glance at our table. That's when we realized that for whatever reason, we were not going to be served at this restaurant, and we had to leave.\n\nWe ended up at a restaurant in Station Square, where staff greeted us in a welcoming manner and served us promptly despite the restaurant being busy. It was like night and day.\n\nWe really liked the location, atmosphere, and menu options of this restaurant and were excited to try it. Unfortunately, we never got to try the food due to non-existent service.

We agreed, but it wasn't very welcoming!  We decided to just order a snack off of the happy hour menu since they didn't want us to stay long.  We ordered 2 orders of truffle fries, an order of the beef sliders and an order of the wings for the 5 of us to split.  The truffle fries had no truffle flavour at all!  And the beef sliders were about 50% fat, 50% beef, the fat was so thick that it was gross!

hot pot! I had been to other hot pot restaurants that were more expensive than Marble house but I still like this place the best. So much varieties and ordering is so much easier after they switched to tablet. Their servers are all pretty friendly I never had any issues with this place and love coming back. Recently we tried their lunch hour for dim sum and again it was a very good experience.  Lots of varieties yet so much better pricing than your typical dim sum restaurants. Nowadays people seem to have forgotten how dim sum started - it's supposed to be like a local restaurant nothing fancy, very casual, yet tasty. Most dim sum restaurants unfortunately are all going for fancy interiors and \""creative\"" dim sums so that they can charge customers more. I was happy that Marble house dim sum reminded me of the good old experience not to mention their portion is good!

The all you can eat hotpot is definitely worth your money here. We ordered a variety of dishes, meats, vegetables and sauces. Similar to what you get at ChoCho or Dolar Shop. Good soup bases here, would recommend the sukiyaki or pork broth.\n\nOverall, the quality of the meats is good. We found the ribeye to be quite meaty and more filling so I would recommend getting the short rib or lamb. The fatty beef was a bit too much in my opinion. They forgot a few of our dishes but that’s okay, we had our fill and it was great!\n\nThe make your own sauce part of the menu was good, you have to order each individual item but we were actually good with that! Also the drinks are unlimited too which was nice! You get ice cream at the end and cotton candy which is different and the cotton candy machine was really neat.\n\nThe meats were of good quality, they have a fair selection of vegetables and non meat options and the seafood was good as well, but certainly could have a few more options. It worked out to about 60$ per person with drinks and tips so it was overall pretty good! Staff were very friendly and attentive.

was my first time experiencing this style of hot pot, and it was quite unique. You start by selecting your ingredients from an extensive array of options, including sliced meats, processed meatballs, noodles, fresh vegetables, and more.

Next, you select a broth, and the restaurant cooks everything together before serving it to you.\n\nWhile it takes away the interactive fun of cooking it yourself, the end result is undeniably delicious, even if it looks like a big bowl of slop. It's a different approach to hot pot, but one that’s worth trying for the flavour alone.

On the other hand, my friends, who were a bit more restrained, managed to keep their meals under $20, with some people even spending under $10. The broth base we chose was the Signature Ma La Tang, which added a nice kick to the hotpot.\n\nOne of the highlights was the complimentary black tea-flavored ice cream they served at the end of the meal—a pleasant and refreshing way to wrap things up.

I was in line with friends, the lady at the till who took our orders looked unhappy with what she was doing. She was not very friendly, and kept a frown on her face. It was busy during that time, but a little bit of friendliness would create a different atmosphere.\n\nThe place is clean, bathrooms are clean, they even have diaper changing table. It is also spacious that could fit a stroller in the bathroom. There were lots of plants which is very beautiful. Lots of tables and chairs.\n\nThey have parking in front and the back.

Earls Station Square for my birthday. Laren was our sever for the evening and he was great until an order mix up which put a damper on the rest of our time at Earls.\n\nI ordered the Cajun Blackened Chicken but instead was served a salmon dish. When I informed Laren about the wrong order, I was met with doubt and annoyance. Laren did not offer to correct the mistake right away and it seemed he wanted to persuade me to keep the salmon. At no point did Laren show accountability for his mistake nor did he apologize for it, it almost appeared that he casted blame my way like I misremembered what I ordered. I had deliberated between a burger and the Cajun Blackened Chicken when I reviewed the menu, not once did I even consider the salmon. I honestly felt gaslit by Laren during this whole interaction… I was certain I ordered the chicken…\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to share a proper meal with my family on my birthday. By the time the correct dish was served, my parents were already finished with their food. What was supposed to be a joyous occasion was shadowed by Laren’s poor attitude and the awkward atmosphere that followed the conversation about the mix up. I felt it was obvious he avoided our table the rest of the evening while he was attentive to others around us. We also waited quite a while for our bill, which furthered the frustration.\n\nThe food somewhat compensated for the poor customer service. All of our dishes were delicious and well made. In addition, I was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary brownie at the end of our meal (not the birthday dessert special, which I felt too awkward to ask Laren about).\n\nAlthough the food was very appetizing, it’s really a shame that Laren’s sour attitude and lack of professionalism made our dining experience uncomfortable and subpar."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPl0b02dlIbOIgXLcQPnM_0BPk9NI9LzdhBP2nz\u0026fid=0x0:0x1e8568236be22147""],""When"":""2024-12-17""},{""Name"":""Thais Oliveira"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKXD1ghyGnpuIJs3_L2s_WmL-t8i8bpNdTnvYmAiDTd_aiIWg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This was the best dining experience I’ve ever had.

The wait was worth it.\n\nService was friendly and inviting, A+ to all the service staff. Atmosphere in my opinion was as expected, it’s an old school feel diner in an industrial park location. It was clean and comfortable but don’t expect 5 star hotel fancy ambiance it’s also not priced like that. Their food portion in a fancy location would easily be jacked up 50% or more.

The menu said it came with a potato pancake, but we unfortunately didn't see it on our plate.\n\nThe food was tasty and satisfying for brunch! The restaurant is very much self-serve as diners pay for drinks like coffee, but it's at the front counter for you to get yourself.

Fraser Park restaurant performed amazingly for the 3 factors I will be evaluating this establishment. For those that are reading this review, i base my factors on Food, Service, and Atmosphere (eating environment).\n\nFirstly, the environment upon entering this establishment was interesting in my opinion. Parking was semi easy because the parking lot in front of the restaurant is PACKED with cars. Luckily there is a park nearby which allows parking. When entering the restaurant, we were greeted with a canteen like setting where you order up front, but they wilI bring food to your table. An interesting concept for sure.\n\nWhen it came down to food, i ordered the deluxe german breakfast. The presentation was nice but as a warning, the sizes here are HUGE, so you certainly will get a bang for your buck here. The food was satisfying to eat, especially the schnitzel, omlette, the sausage, and potatoes. The schnitzel with gravy was savoury yet rich which activated all my tastebuds. The omlette tasted alright, but with the cheese, became a stable part of the dish. Sausage tasted great as it was nice and savoury, along with the properly fried potatoes. Overall was very satisfied with what I ate.\n\nSimply amazing place to eat your breakfast or lunch. Great portion sizes and the taste for the food proved to amplify my dining experience. From the schnitzel to the omlette, it tasted amazing, which for generic breakfast food such as this, surprised me, as I thought the food would be subpar at best. I highly recommend this establishment to friends and family. Simply a must try and you will be hooked!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOmpPpB35XlA-WXgLnQgI4ySavN1OZTKkxeL_5_\u0026fid=0x0:0x39f3b68fe8fb837a""],""When"":""2024-5-14""},{""Name"":""Minji Co"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW0cW7yUIGQwxewtq2t91XH-PweiJmGMnXmQUWs9lKXUa5ZbKC6vQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Set in an industrial area so it has a hole in the wall feel.

The poke itself was good, as diners have the ability to choose from a variety of toppings (no limit for the \""regular\"" toppings). The amount of vegetables included is fair, and the bowls overall were solid. Standard toppings like imitation crab, wakame, pineapple, edamame, and a variety of onions. The most unique complimentary topping was pickled radish. I did appreciate that you could get plain fish if you didn't want a pre-marinated option.\n\nWe had a service issue which caused us to be at the store for much longer than expected. It became clear early on we were being helped by a new staff member. They had to re-do my bowl after I asked for their gluten-friendly Ponzu sauce option, and they initially used the regular sauce on the side. They were unsure if it was gluten-friendly or not, but used it anyways until it came to light later when they consulted with another employee. We also had to repeat multiple times that we wanted all the complimentary toppings aside from the ginger. In the bowl re-do, I watched the staffer almost include ginger so had to step in vocally as a reminder.\n\nFor one of our bowls, we asked if they could include a bit more fish, as it didn't look like a full scoop. Earlier, a more experienced female staffer told us that the fish they use is fresh and they don't always leave them out in the open. They indicated that if we ordered the non-spicy fish, they would get it fresh for our bowls (likely from the back). Yet, the staffer helping us was essentially scraping the nearly empty bins for fish and therefore, their one scoop wasn't really a \""full\"" scoop. When watching the other employees prepare bowls for others, we noticed they were more generous with their protein scoops. While the employee did apologize a couple of times for the bowl re-do, it was awkward for us as we didn't want to feel like we had to watch them prepare it, but it ended up being kind of necessary. There was also a lack of urgency because at that point, two other employees were building bowls for new customers. Someone, perhaps the store manager, did step in at one point to inform us of the toppings which were gluten-friendly (or not).\n\nOur first Steve's Poke Bar experience was an alright one! The fruit tea was delicious, and the poke itself was good. The service was not as positive due to the mishaps, but we'll probably be back as the regular prices are affordable. We also signed up for their rewards program using our phone number, although we weren't quite sure what it entails when we provided our number."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOdZR7GIBP6txxQK4KAObuh22ntSLRMKcGBqJIE\u0026fid=0x0:0xd578361c2fe014e2""],""When"":""2024-4-1""},{""Name"":""Dina H"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIfsq97R4sgDIOe7gesF05bhBwqVTm4mfLDvrvgUPwpnj6y7A=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Good portions.

Food is okay, their rotisserie chicken very juicy and tender. their famous fried chicken still taste the same way before, not great but undeniably very addictive. Their rice mix with lentil souce is on my 2nd plate. Tomatoes soup is ok, not the chicken soup. rest was less appetizing.  Love their jello mix with apple souce and ice cream, got 2 bowl of them.

You can see a takeout menu on the wall also- here in my 3rd photo along-with VERY fair prices! They have Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc, celebration meals and the MENUS CHANGE DAILY! The food is always hot and tastey! Price is depending on what day- around 24.99 for adults, less for seniors and children WEEKDAYS,  and 25.99 on the WEEKEND-for ALL YOU CAN EAT buffet! We had  this time, really tasty choices- sliced pork, curry chicken, ROAST beef, chowmein, Spring rolls, perogies, excellent gravy, salads, condiments, frenchfries, corn, lasagna, different kinds of  juicy tasty chicken-fried, baked, roasted,  macaroni, mashed potatoes, deserts, ice cream, and SO MUCH MORE!✅️. You can always get take out buffet items home-menu in pictures!  Take a look at the value, choices, and amount you have for the prices- AND the food quality and taste is there❤️! Friday nights, for instance, they have a Sushi chef come and make a few varieties- alongside the other choices of buffet items there! GREAT home tasting foods😁. We ARE going back- SO much to offer! Nice, friendly, attentive staff✅️✅️. They were out tidying, and refilling as soon as an item needed replenishing. I cannot say enough - GREAT experience😋! You aren't hurried even!

Very extreme price\n\n2) Frankie : the Base roti is too hard and it doesn’t taste like Frankie\n\n3) Misal Pav : Mixture has a bad smell, oily smell and poor quality ingredients used in it.\n\n4) Samosa Ragada : normally ragada is very hot and here these fraudsters serve with frozen samosa and poor channa !

The tonkotsu base was lacking depth and creaminess. But for my black garlic one, they do put a hefty amount of it so you get the black garlicky goodness all the way until the end. The cha siu was super soft. One of the better ramen cha sius of vancouver. You can choose the broth richness but I wish you can choose the noodle doneness. The noodles were al dente in the beginning but quickly got soggy. Usually I got for a harder noodle doneness so its perfect midway through.\n\nThere are things you can add to the ramen yourself. There's ramen sauce - not sure what it is but it was flavorful. There's also fried garlic. Adds a nice touch and other restaurants don't have this.\n\nThe chicken karaage was lacking. Small pieces. Not fried well. The takoyaki was good due to the sauces but obviously frozen takoyaki, which makes it quite expensive.\n\n$16.95 for black garlic tonkotsu ramen is expensive for the quality they give.

here and it was nice to see a variety of things here at the restaurant between Pizzas, Pastas \u0026 Others. Its not a big space but a lot of groups larger than 4 come here so its pretty nice and very accommodating space wise. The food was a 8/10 or maybe Italian food may not be for me but this is one of the better Italian  restaurants I’ve been to. The service (or rather just our server) was hard to ignore as either her negative aura or just her disdain to be serving our rather large group (PTY of 11) was showing. Our server was polite but her attitude made more than just 1 member of our party uncomfortable and unfortunately that attitude would be memorable . Again the service was not terrible but it goes to show how serving is a hard job. I also thank her for dealing with us. We weren’t terrible but most likely slow. Anyways most likely to come again and hopefully if i get the server again she’ll be in a better mood. I would come back for the food and atmosphere:)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPWgv_J8CosTkDbJlqg_Cimei1CbS_ywxBJhJuH\u0026fid=0x0:0x7344f5d8fd9866f0""],""When"":""2024-7-6""},{""Name"":""Claire P L"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXJGM2D4TICm4bsRYfNUkKyVabhXL5nYa_FiMr3mZxJdxDKqf4=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The rigatoni is so flavourful and a little spicy, i really loved it. recommend to share the mains family style since the portion is decent.

I was left disappointed.\n\nPros:\n- the restaurant was able to accommodate for 14 when I first requested for 12. Ended up with 12 guests and a table was removed which worked out for the dinner.\n- Cocktails and food were the highlights and the overall ambiance was good.\n- tiramisu was delicious\n\nCons:\n-  had completed the initial form for a group reservation on their website and after 1 email asking me what time was best and I had replied, there was no answer for 3 days. Had to send a follow up email which then the reservation was made.\n\n- When I had arrived with my group, the server was not aware of the occasion (birthday) and took a long time to take drink orders, meal orders, etc. As the host, my guests had noticed the server had given snarky looks (passive aggressiveness) to them as they were asking for simple items such as chili flakes. Though not mandatory, the dessert for my birthday was not complimentary.\n\nOverall, I would go back but not as frequent as I would before and would avoid doing a group booking due to response rate and how my group was treated."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBNSFRAdN-_aWlGVbuzz-P_oj3yltq_nBgVdM-\u0026fid=0x0:0x7344f5d8fd9866f0""],""When"":""2024-7-2""},{""Name"":""Hyebin Lee"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUjDtbZAwmClVNZWe8in7iKPeuWFpJk3xV63n3oUYqAkU_8FufJ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We ordered gnocchi and prosciutto pizza.\nThe portion was good for Italian and food was great to enjoy the natural tastes of the ingredients.

Riverway as our wedding venue.

All my quests were very impressed by the food and many said it was best wedding food they have ever had. The desserts were also delicious.  I also received a lot of compliments on how beautiful the venue is. The staff were very on top of the buffet and making sure food was replaced as soon as getting low and the chef was able to accommodate the few guests I had who had special dietary needs. One of the reasons I chose Riverway was the very transparent pricing as well. I compared several venues before choosing and I especially liked how straightforward the pricing structure is at Riverway and it made it easy to plan my budget. I have zero regrets or complaints and could not have chosen a better place to share my special day.\n\nUpdate:  Two weeks after wedding I am still getting calls and texts about how good the good the food was.

The facilities and landscaping are impeccably maintained. I must also mention how stunning the sunset was, casting its glow right above the fountain in August and creating a magical scene for our sunset photos. This is something we will never forget!\nWe are so happy we chose the plated dinner option, which was a crucial requirement for us. The food was amazing, and many of our guests complimented it, especially the dessert buffet. The serving staff and bartenders were professional and fun to talk to.

While my friend and I were in the middle of a conversation, she could have chosen to serve from the other side but instead served between us, completely interrupting our discussion.

Unfortunately, this year was disappointing. From the start, our waitress seemed uninterested—there was no friendly introduction or small talk, which made us feel neither welcome nor acknowledged. She took our orders with minimal engagement and later returned, forgetting which side dish I had chosen. Her demeanour lacked warmth and genuine care; she only checked in with two brief, impersonal questions, \""Is everything good?\"" before quickly walking away.\n\nTo add to the experience, I ordered a medium-rare tomahawk steak but received it rare. While the food had potential, the inattentive service from our waitress overshadowed what could have been a memorable meal.\n\nThis year’s birthday experience was particularly disappointing compared to previous ones. For the last three birthdays, whether I celebrated with a group or just my wife, the servers would always surprise me with a complimentary dessert. They either knew about it through the reservation or took the time to inquire. I had no expectations this time, as it was clear from the beginning that the waitress didn’t care. It’s disheartening to see such a difference in service on what should have been a memorable night.\n\nAfter our disappointing meal, we only wanted the bill and a takeout box since we had a lot of food left. However, the waitress only brought one box, which was another oversight. By that point, we were eager to go. We ended up stuffing it all in one box, and we were done in an hour from\ngetting there and leaving because the lacklustre service made the experience far from enjoyable."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOdD-pzJyGpmepZVI5iYJQKVvD6yw_UAoTREfGU\u0026fid=0x0:0xd45e50d67854772c""],""When"":""2024-11-3""},{""Name"":""Jonathan Leung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV9QzZE25WJY2Aa0NjLRlLU5VaKnW39cVAjboDLckOZD4XxInumSQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""We had previously visited the Langley Atlas Steak + Fish and had a fantastic experience, so we were excited to try the Burnaby location while in the area. Unfortunately, our visit on November 30th for my wife's birthday fell short of expectations.\n\nWe had a reservation for an early dinner at 4:00 PM and arrived slightly early at 3:30 PM, hoping to be seated. The hostess, however, was engrossed in her iPad and did not acknowledge us for several minutes. When she finally did, she avoided eye contact and told us we could wait in the bar or until 4:00 PM to be seated in the dining area. We mentioned that we were there to celebrate my wife's birthday and opted to wait for our reservation time.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, we returned to check in and were once again ignored as the hostess continued tapping on her iPad. Eventually, she grabbed some menus and informed us that only the Happy Hour menu was available until 5:00 PM—a detail not mentioned anywhere on the website. In most restaurants, Happy Hour offers additional, cheaper options alongside the main menu, so we were surprised and disappointed to learn that we couldn't order from the full dinner menu until 5:00 PM. I shared our concerns, explaining that this wasn’t what we expected for a birthday dinner, but the hostess reiterated that our only option was to wait.\n\nOnce seated, our server greeted us, and we expressed our frustration. He agreed that the website wasn't clear and implied it wasn't the first time he'd received similar feedback. To his credit, he allowed us to order appetizers from the main menu but confirmed we'd still have to wait until 5:00 PM for entrees. This inconsistency—exceptions for appetizers but not main dishes—further dampened the evening. At this point, we considered leaving but decided to stay, knowing our dinner would take longer than expected.\n\nAfter finishing our appetizers, the server returned to let us place our entree orders so they could arrive shortly after 5:00 PM. We ordered the lobster risotto, truffle tenderloin, and a side of brussel sprouts. While the food was delicious and well-prepared, the overall service left much to be desired. It was acceptable but lacked warmth, and despite multiple mentions that we were celebrating a birthday, there was no effort to make the occasion feel special.\n\nWe did receive a complimentary dessert, which was a nice gesture, but it came with \""Happy Anniversary\"" written on it instead of \""Happy Birthday.\"" Given that our reservation noted the birthday celebration, and both the hostess and server were aware, this oversight felt careless. We didn't have the heart to correct it, so we simply ended our evening.\n\nWhile the food lived up to Atlas's standards, the lack of clarity, underwhelming service, and missed opportunities to make the occasion feel special ultimately overshadowed our experience. We had high hopes for the Burnaby location, but unfortunately, it did not meet the expectations set by the Langley restaurant.\n\nI don't expect we will visit this location again and would recommend the Langley location of Atlas Steak + Fish."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOV2Py0_vDTcgaljmnKfsV8P7i8EGb5NiWHc040\u0026fid=0x0:0xd45e50d67854772c""],""When"":""2024-12-15""},{""Name"":""Nancy Lam"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW0OLHpxrUE61BZqWGZfm_HMiegDgnBQAyUAh3yxMEuIa2bR7Sy=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""What a wonderful place to have\nChristmas Dinner!

The Kuku Choma was perfectly grilled and tender, while the Lamb Biriane was fragrant and savory, with each grain of rice infused with delicious spices. The Muhogo was a delightful surprise, crispy and well-seasoned.\n\nOne of the highlights of our visit was the friendly and attentive service from the owner himself.

It came with a wild mix of BBQ steak 🥩 bites called mishkaki, lamb 🐑 kababs, fried fish 🐟, BBQ spicy chicken 🐔 tenders and spinach 🍛 with rice 🍚. Honestly, we felt like royalty dining on all this, and there were so many flavors. It was nice how the African flavors mixed with Indian.\n\nWe also ordered the Jungle Ribs because, well, who can resist ribs with a name like that? These ribs didn't just fall off the bone — they practically leaped off! I’m not sure if they marinate them in magic or what, but the ribs were juicy, spicy, and had us licking our fingers like cavemen (sorry, fancy napkins).\n\nIf you're into bold flavors and hearty portions, Simba’s Grill is a must-visit.

First time in this location. A compromise but perfect location between downtown Vancouver and Langley for a small gathering for a lunch chat.\nHad craving for the clam chowder and a bacon mushroom burger with fries. But a colleague ordered a strawberry milkshake and on a hot day, that seemed like a really good idea. Unashamedly ordered same.\nThe place was not crowded and the service was relaxed but staff were very friendly and responsive. Food was what I expected and remembered.\nFacility was accessible and washrooms looked well maintained and clean albeit felt a bit dark. Though it seems to fit with the overall design of the restaurant.\nThe booth was reasonably comfortable but recall them to be a tad more roomy. This maybe more related to my increasing girth over the years than the furnitures themselves.

My friend enjoyed their beef noodle soup, which was equally satisfying.\n\nWe tried both hot and cold Vietnamese coffee, which were average, but the overall meal experience was wonderful.

Cafe\n\nBliss Cafe in Burnaby has quickly become my go-to spot for a satisfying meal. On my first visit, I tried the marinated preserved vegetable boiled fish cutlets, and on my second visit, I had the fried chicken nuggets with rice. Both dishes came with a portion of rice and were reasonably priced as of 2024.\n\nThe flavors of the marinated preserved vegetable boiled fish cutlets were delightful, with a perfect balance of spices and freshness. The fried chicken nuggets were crispy and well-seasoned, making for a satisfying meal. While the portion sizes might be enough for those with a smaller appetite, they might not be sufficient for those who are particularly hungry.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Bliss Cafe is their subscription-based menu, which encourages customers to return and try new dishes regularly. It would be great to see them rotate other menu items on sale, as I am eager to try more of their offerings.\n\nOverall, I had no unpleasant experiences at Bliss Cafe. The food was tasty, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was welcoming. I look forward to my next visit and exploring more of their menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN1dgrxPxM3wNzn1DXVDfe0QZ7_I-ktnq11n9N4\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b3491e7bd53ffd""],""When"":""2024-12-17""},{""Name"":""Hiep Nguyen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWMRHHZ7t798igHqhwEObqqiXXBYRe7_vTRRS3-gXG7fOgZlXSH=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Met a friend here for lunch today because the new Ramen place up the street that just opened had a line up out the door.

It was an awful experience. The food is okay, but there are plenty of good Taiwanese restaurants around here, such as The One and Aroma Eatery. However, hygiene was very questionable. For example, they gave us the wrong dish, and after it was sitting on our table for 5 minutes, they realized their mistake and took it to another table without even recooking their food! In addition, their service was poor. They brought food out for the majority of our group but it took an addition 35 minutes to bring out the food for other 3 people in our group!!!! During this time, we reminded their waitress several times that our friends’ food wasn’t here yet, and they did nothing. In the end, this meant that some people in the group finished their food before the others’ had even arrived (and it was cold for the people who waited). We did not receive any apology for this…\nAlso, they gave us the wrong dish as their “knife cut” noodle (see below) but gaslit us and told us this was “knife cut” when it clearly was not. I have been to many Taiwanese and Xian restaurants with knife cut noodles, and this is not it….\nThe only reason they got a 2 star for atmosphere is because the interior is reasonably new and well lit."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPkx8Mi9DSd-ezJOr11PQ5gOpkLdTjK43m4q1lF\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b3491e7bd53ffd""],""When"":""2024-6-16""},{""Name"":""Carolyn Wu"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocID-ne5zGEq4LZpDeyBnWOjv7ymh8I7w7axyhOpoZGb3Woga6o=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Extremely poor service.

It's somewhat hidden in the Best Western location on Kingsway and has a strange interior layout.\n\nBack then, their xiao long baos were under $5. Now, their steamed Shanghai dumplings are almost double the price ($9.68). But I do admit that they are better than I remember them to be. Filling is fairly juicy. Note that I've had them a couple of times over the last few weeks and found the filling to be different on different occasions. Sometimes being more meaty than other times.\n\nAs a Shanghai restaurant, their dim sum offering is a bit limited compared to a Cantonese restaurant.\n\nWe ordered their turnip cakes ($9.68) which were round cakes filled with shredded radish (we kind of ordered this thinking it was like the Cantonese lo bak go but this is much drier in consistency like a pastry).\n\nThe fried shredded buns ($5.98) is a classic served with condensed milk for dipping. I know this more as silver thread buns (which can be either steamed or fried) due to the fluffy interior of the bun.\n\nThe pan fried pork buns are basically the like the steamed pork buns but wrapped up like a soft bao and then pan fried for a crispy bottom.  The bottoms were super crispy and the filling was still soupy.\n\nWe also ordered the deep fried thick noodles with shredded pork ($18.98). Contrary to the English menu name, the noodles really aren't thick. I wish their menu names were more descriptive."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPQusXVfEFP-rHnxkCBfTvTG3dSoHYDcB3FrTdU\u0026fid=0x0:0x73a8dcb1eaf5a89f""],""When"":""2024-8-11""},{""Name"":""Zacery Wood"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXdPmKc7b7qQr6cN9eNebNcie4ffrySE-Dvtj5AwsHYOkDNKfc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""The photo on the order platform is totally different than what we received.

Persian Cuisine on Hastings Street in Burnaby for the first time and had a mixed experience. The restaurant has a decent and friendly atmosphere, and I was able to find a table reasonably quickly, which was a plus.\n\nI ordered the Lentil Rice and Lamb, a dish recommended by the server. The portion size was generous, which initially seemed promising. However, the taste of the food did not live up to my expectations. The rice and gravy tasted dull and stale, lacking the vibrant flavors I was hoping for. The lamb, unfortunately, seemed to have been pressure-cooked to the point where it had little to no texture left. The consistency of the sauce was quite runny, almost like water, and it didn’t have a memorable taste profile.\n\nAdditionally, the wait time for the food after placing the order was quite lengthy. This might not be suitable for workers who need to get their food quickly during a lunch break.\n\nWhile the service was friendly and the environment pleasant, the quality of the food was disappointing. I had high hopes for a flavorful and rich Persian meal, but the experience fell short. I hope the restaurant can improve the taste and texture of their dishes in the future."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOV5ncgI0UerLObjeIqVUftYM1z3Lqcd3pkWk9Y\u0026fid=0x0:0x6d5c4923e8c333bc""],""When"":""2024-12-17""},{""Name"":""Tareq Soufi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJFZqlpVBGqEDJMPzqm7XeWclRMd74ChXcqbjw9qulwOXy9dw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I won’t be exaggerating if I say that this is by FAR, the best Persian food/ restaurant I’ve been to not only in B.C, but Canada!!\n\nService; Excellent!\nAtmosphere; Excellent!\nFood quality, taste \u0026 portion: Excellent Excellent Excellent!!\n\nKeep up the amazing work guys,\nThanks to our servers ATA \u0026 Maryam!!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPwEOItOzPawXYLcw1Gzl0UmWxBzBbuPoED7Kqs\u0026fid=0x0:0x6d5c4923e8c333bc""],""When"":""2024-10-6""},{""Name"":""Robert Arbor"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVCQGcQxjL0YQQBQdJ531QwsU3eO8jWw8yRkMmtgTNQ-bybYFg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Went for dinner on a Monday night at about 7 o clock.

It was very smooth, with mild flavours. The bread provided with dip was slightly on the dry side but it was overall delicious. The deep fried dumplings were sort of like an empanada and I could taste more vegetables than beef in them and was served with fries and ketchup. The grilled chicken wings were also mild flavoured but the chicken was ver juicy and had nice char to it.\n\nFor the main, we ordered the koobideh kebab and chicken kebab. They were cooked to perfection with lots of flavour and served with Persian rice which was slightly dry but the juices from the kebabs mixed with the rice add to the flavour. The dish was also served with pickled beet root and grilled tomato, which really adds to the bulk of the meal and was an absolute delight.\n\nWe were attended to and served by their employee Ata, who was very hospitable and delightful.

It used to be 16.88 but now they upped it to 18.88\n\nThe first time I went there was crab and braised pork belly. The second time there were clams and lamb neck? The things that were the same: tomato egg, dumplings, steamed baos, chineze fried donut, and cold dishes like bean sprouts, smashed cucumbers, tea egg, tofu dessert.\n\nThey also have hot soy milk for drinks.\n\nTheir deep fried chinese donut has got to be the best I've ever had in my life. With the price of a pair of fried donut being over $6 these days, I get my fix here. Other things are standard, good but not outstanding. I really like having soy milk to drink instead of water.\n\n$18.88 is getting a little steep for a limited choice buffet with not too many meat choices. The crab/clam are a nice addition but if there are days without it, it wouldn't be worth.\n\nI would rate the food from this place higher than the similar chinese lunch box style place in richmond, K squared mansion.\n\n--may 2024--\nTried their too good to go. The portion for 6.99 is great! You just never know what leftovers they have so it's a gamble if youre picky.\nI got 2 boxes, both had egg/tomato, mapo tofu, and chicken and bell pepper.

I have seen a family of 3 with a toddler, a group of 6 who were having a round of drinks and food, and plenty of friends sharing a meal.\n\nOnly one star lost for a fruit fly found twice in the large rocket of beer(had to exchange the rocket of beer twice). Each time though, it was exchanged promptly and with no fuss.\n\nI managed to taste: beef, chicken, chicken wings, squid, shrimp, scallops, eggplant, and a chive pastry.\n\nAll were great- reasonable prices(although my brother said typically this type of BBQ is not cheap), but the flavour is just so good! I usually ask for a dip, but with each meat marinated and seasoned specifically for each dish, I was never bored and in need of dipping sauces.\n\nNow it's not my typical restaurant choice- so I had help with the ordering from my brother and his roommate. There is no rush to finish all the food, there is a mini BBQ at your table to keep food warm.\n\nThe bathrooms were fine(functioning toilet and sink), the service was decently fast- about 15 mins for Skewers to arrive, and that was on a busy (tables were full) Saturday night. And with the service, they are good- very straight-forward.\n\nHighlights:\nExciting eating concept\nNew flavours I hadn't tried\nSeafood was delicious\nPlates were promptly removed when empty\n\nTo note:\nDecent parking (in a strip mall)\nWheelchair accessible\nKids allowed\nReservations are allowed\nPlenty of menu items to try!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPLXRI_7OrAG0hrFRlETp7QxAw4JvcBg3Npirw\u0026fid=0x0:0xa1b02baaa2055943""],""When"":""2023-9-18""},{""Name"":""S"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJFi8NUjGIjAKGAmU4BvQNO7lvH7EJ0udfkQsxzZ-7f2FSyPQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""There’s no service at all, we spent almost an hour there but they didnt refill my water and napkin until I requested.

Some Tiktok videos showed fried shrimp (which I didn't see) so I think the menu does change up a bit. There are complimentary hot tea and hot soy milk (some said the soy milk was watered down but I find it quite nice!) And you are supposed to wait for the staff to serve you aka scoop the foods onto your tray but as you can see from my photo, some impatient customers would reach over and scoop food themselves which is a bit annoying. Once you get in, tell them dine in or takeout and line up. They will provide a metal tray with rice and you basically point to what you want. Later one of the servers would come over to you with card machine. They also have sliced apples and oranges!! Tell them ahead of time if you have seniors or not!

Unfortunately, we came during the day when they have a smaller \""breakfast\"" menu and no bbq items.\n\nInside, the interior is filled with neon lights. Quite different than the last restaurant that used to occupy this location.\n\nFood was actually pretty good but also slow to come out. The beef rolls were good and the sauce wasn't too sweet. I liked the steamed dumplings - they were quite large and plump.\n\nOverall, would have liked to try their bbq.\n\nUpdate: Came back for a revisit during dinner and the skewers turned out great. Especially liked the appy platter where you can choose up to 4 different appys and their dumplings.\n\nUpdate: Feb 2024 - We revisited in mid Feb and had some skewers but we noticed that they are now offering ayce options where they have a buffet area with different offerings. The ayce options differ between lunch and dinner (think it is only available on certain days so check beforehand). I think they have someone that dishes out the items from the buffet that you pick. Will have to try it sometime.\n\nUpdate April 2024: We finally tried their AYCE offering. It was $18.88 for lunch on a Sunday. They man the buffet station and you just tell them what you want to eat. While they had crab, it was quite dry and I honestly wouldn't come here for this kind of crab. I thought the clams were pretty good and we definitely ate a lot. The big issue is most of the food isn't really hot as it's sitting in those trays and they wind up being luke warm at best. The flavors also aren't as good as the things we've had made fresh.

I drank all the soup directly, and it was not wasted at all!\n\nThe tomato beef rice noodles are also good. Although I think the flavor of the soup base is not as good as the fish maw and chicken soup, it is still a very delicious one! The beef is equally generous, the meat is tender, and it is paired with the sweet and sour tomato soup base, which is especially suitable for friends who like refreshing tastes.\n\nOverall, Meetrice efforts in the ingredients and soup base are definitely worth the price, and I recommend it to every friend who loves rice noodles!

I was told this iconic noodle dish is China’s most famous Yunnan “Crossing The Bridge” rice noodle soup restaurant chains with over 600 locations around the world.\n\nThere is free parking in the back and it’s limited to a few stalls. But there’s cheap street parking out front if you can’t find a spot, as well as it’s free after a certain time.\n\nUpon entering this location it’s very clean with the air conditioning on during the hot day. The decor is very nice and the staff is very friendly.\n\nOur family ordered some great recommendations. The top #1 selling beef and tomato, the white pepper, and definitely the fish maw and chicken broths. We struggled ordering because the menu is difficult to navigate. We also wanted to try a few appetizers so we got the chicken nuggets and chicken gizzards.\n\nThe stone bowls arrive piping hot so be careful. That white pepper soup broth has a nice kick. The fish maw and chicken was soooo comforting. These 2 have become my favourite so far. If you still have a lot of broth left over you can ask for another serving of noodles for free. It’s unlimited but I find after asking once, I’m at the limit.\n\nThey have a self serve sauce and garnish bar that a lot of people don’t know about. Take as much as you want but please don’t waste.\n\nOverall it was a great first experience for me. My brother and his wife has been at this location many times and it has now become one of their favourite spots to eat. I’ll definitely be back soon. The quality is excellent. So much flavour in their broths. Come to think of it I prefer this over deer garden signature.

food itself was just okay, kind of bland. The best part was the pumpkin broth I chose, but at the start, as it got watered down later. The milk tea was very good as well. Aside from that the cabbage was probably the best part of the hotpot combo (vegetarian option) and everything else was bland, compared to items I could buy myself at T\u0026T. The udon were also tasteless and not good texture - too doughy. The hotpot combo is a good choice and id recommend that option as you get your main pick, a carb side, drink and dessert. Personally wouldn't go again, not for the wait time or price. Our plan was to meet at like 7:15-730, and join the wait-list since they don't take reservations, but we didn't get seated until like 830.\n\nThe service however was great, the staff were friendly and attentive. I think the rest of my group probably enjoyed their time, I just personally thought it was overall too bland and would rather go elsewhere like big way hotpot or boiling point to get my money's worth. Or even go to T\u0026T and pick up hotpot items and make our own."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNtrskr2dldhPehl0gpurNsVzaLi3qNZQFtalCo\u0026fid=0x0:0x68e358067d4ef96e""],""When"":""2024-9-22""},{""Name"":""Adam Gauthier"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWxRc7XInTHhMkSXbLH4BabJg43_crL9J2O0ePhYQT9gQqJOcau=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""We got the hot pot combos, one with the default house special chicken broth and one with sukiyaki broth.

I went with their house special with wontons and hand sliced noodles. The broth was hot and didn’t taste too artificial.

The portions were so large that we couldn’t finish it even though there were quite a bit of us there. They were hot and crispy and really complemented the soup. 🦑\n\nService was also great, they allowed us to combine the tables together so everyone can eat and enjoy staring at each other while we celebrated our friend’s special day. They even played the 'happy birthday' song which was great!\n\nThe interior and lighting was also nice. It was modern and brightly lit and seating was comfy.\n\nThe only con I would say is the parking. I would advise to park at the BCIT parking lot nearby and just walk here during busy hours because it's a nightmare finding parking here when every Asian person is parked on a lane with their hazard lights on.\n\nOverall, this was a great establishment to have a birthday dinner with lots of people.

However, the service left much to be desired. When we tried to order individual dishes, the server persistently pushed us to opt for their more expensive set dinner.

Like some other Chinese restaurants, they asked if we could pay in cash and offered a 10% discount. However, the discount didn’t apply to the entire bill. They told us that only regular items were eligible for the discount, and the duck we ordered, which cost $100, was excluded. It felt like a bit of a trick, as the cash discount ended up saving us only a few bucks.\n\nI’d recommend avoiding paying in cash here. It doesn’t really benefit you as a customer and can make it feel like they're just avoiding taxes while offering minimal savings.\n\nOverall, while the food was ok, the upselling, confusing payment terms, and feeling thirsty after the meal made the experience less enjoyable."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNfGWXXNUu28tQeReZLZghZAf4w9guhR4OSSZqS\u0026fid=0x0:0x313d915b0b468f26""],""When"":""2024-9-17""},{""Name"":""Stanley Lowe"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLMA0j5YPV0e_ki7txxd7xeDBLDLGeQTP8WAcMSalz9cV9eFw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Came with dad on a Sunday Funday morning at 10 am.

There’s one in Coquitlam and one in Burnaby. I came to this location in Burnaby on Kingsway. Also, if it’s your first time here, the entrance is behind the building where their back parking lot is. There’s plenty of parking all around the neighborhood.\n\nIt was a hot day and the air conditioning was on. The restaurant is very spacious. This type of restaurant is a banquet style setting with Cantonese style cuisine. You come here for the seafood to maximize your experience, but there are many other items that are non seafood.\n\nOur family came here to celebrate Father’s Day early. We decided to get the lobster set dinner. Btw this kitchen was on fire that day. We had all our main items come out to us in less than 18 mins. That’s incredible. At one point we were wondering if another table had cancelled their order LOL.\n\nFirst came the fish maw crab soup. Done wonderfully and with real crab. Great start to the dinner. Very silky and savoury. Great preparation with the fish maw. Sponge soft with a feather crunch.\n\nThe crab claws are very classic Cantonese style. Be careful they are piping hot in the center. Done properly and very delicious. They come with a sauce to dip if it fancies you but I like it au natural 😬\n\nThe lobster with noodle was very classic. Great flavours but I thought the noodle was a touch skimpy. No complaints on how it tasted. Very comforting.\n\nScallop and beef tenderloin with broccoli. The scallops weren’t over cooked. The beef was soft. The broccoli cooked perfectly.\n\nOur vegetable dish we chose the snow pea tip leafs modified in vegetable stock. Normally it’s eaten with garlic stir fried. But for 5 bucks more you can modify this dish. Either way it’s delicious and considered among very nutritious with a good source of vitamin C, folate, fiber, and beta carotene.\n\nThe chicken dish we had it upgraded ($5 bucks more) to the salt roasted chicken with crispy rice chips. All the kids love eating the rice chips haha. The chicken wasn’t dry. It was moist and light on the saltiness.\n\nThe seafood fried rice done to standards\nYou can taste the element of the wok hei, the breath of the wok fire 🔥\n\nDessert that night was the classic red bean soup. It was delicious. We were also surprised that the kitchen gave us almond cookies. They were made in house and was so delicious and fresh.\n\nIt was a great Father’s Day dinner. So pretty much a 9 course with desserts included. It can definitely feed 4-5 adults. The service is amazing. There’s very few Chinese places that have such attention to their customers. They are kind and always social.\nGreat first experience. I’ll definitely be coming back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOEDRW3O9w8qblsplz4y6anGqy61L1xtwu2NzmQ\u0026fid=0x0:0x313d915b0b468f26""],""When"":""2024-6-17""},{""Name"":""Hillbillytc"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV833YeKMKJfxtYeKhRHVRSrikZoFOcCapKBwyEFBOnxiCMeXAZ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The food was hot and tasty.

The food and service at this location were consistent with the standards we've experienced at other ZUBU spots.  However, we were slightly disappointed with the ramen noodles — they were soft and overcooked. This was unexpected since ZUBU typically delivers on quality.  We also noticed a steady stream of takeout orders, which may have impacted the kitchen's focus.\n\nOn a brighter note, we redeemed our ZUBU rewards points for their 5-piece Crispy Chicken and Pan-Fried Pork Gyoza, both of which were delicious!  If you're a fan of ZUBU, downloading their app is a must — it’s an easy way to earn rewards and enjoy perks during every visit.\n\nOverall, ZUBU Metrotown is a decent option for a casual bite during a shopping trip, but we hope they can improve consistency, especially with their ramen.\n\n📝📝\n\nFood: 🍜🍜🍜 Can Try!\nService: 👩‍🍳👩‍🍳👩‍🍳👩‍🍳\nKids: 👶👶👶👶 Yay!

Individual portions are even smaller than a mini and the cumulative size of all three is probably similar to that of a mini ( by weight/volume) which doesn't seem to be worth the price as I could get a regular sized ramen for cheaper. See picture of empty bowls for size comparison between mini and those in the flight ( keep in mind that the it's typically filled to slightly below the zubu word on the bowl and that is the narrowest parts of the bowl which creates an optical illusion that it's alot larger than it actually is).

hotpot places in the area, newly opened after Station Square was revamped and rebuilt. We made a reservation for 7:15pm, we arrived on time and we were seated by 7:45pm. I wonder if they understand how reservation works or how bad their time management is. The reserved space shouldn't be occupied at the time of reservation.\n\nWe were given a $20 item offer for the delay as an apology, but surely our time is worth more. The greeter desk is often emptied, i kept seeing other guests getting confused as they come in, and no one was around. (See pic)\n\nThe place uses a tablet ordering system.\nThere are choices on soup base and ingredients you wish to order for the meal. The soup base comes with an additional charge for the sauce and dessert regardless of whether you want them or not. They provided a cover for the pot so you don't end up burning yourself. In general, the food tastes okay.\n\nHowever, it is relatively overrated for the price and experience. You can surely get better for more economical options."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPg0qXqPzUqS0jRD5YRPn54DWv8GbOTdYfkjCvy\u0026fid=0x0:0xeef46ded33085721""],""When"":""2024-12-16""},{""Name"":""Agnes"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXyqJcbJDbElC-RwU1sBP46by6tVeVGdJmv6s9B0kjpjwDghjdVVw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Hot pot is a big thing.

We had the crab linguine and the pizza with arugula and prosciutto. Both entrees were seasoned super well. Generous amounts of crab in the pasta and the sauce was so so yummy. Pizza was good, the crust was a touch dry for my liking but the toppings were delicious. The pizza was heavily topped, we had to mop up the leftover arugula. It was so good.\n\nNot pictured is the tiramisu, which was super light yet strongly coffee flavored. Very well balanced.\n\nThe restaurant has great ambiance, lots of natural lighting, and comfortable seating. We had a server who was prompt and to the point which we appreciated.\n\nI can't wait to be back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOalCRxQaSo1c1g0OtOtTKCAs8t8mehryhqEb7i\u0026fid=0x0:0x8ab025f5a5359877""],""When"":""2024-8-7""},{""Name"":""Shelley Anne Shorter"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVo42l5sIRiNx3QxgOLKDM_-bPv1rxvGRkox0mBfbGM4a57adyk=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I brought my friend here for a birthday lunch quite early on a weekday (12:30) so we practically had the place to ourselves!

Most places only have prime rib available on Sundays so it's nice to enjoy this mid-week.\n\nLocated inside the hotel, there us free parking for restaurant guests (put your license plate down on the sheet located at the hotel lobby desk).\n\nIt wasn't too busy on our visit. We had a view of the small hotel pool from our table. Got the acqua sipper (cranberry, pineapple, mango) and Pacific breeze (coconut water, ice tea, muddled mint and lime) to drink.\n\nThr prime rib special is 10oz ($32) with yorkshire pudding. A good price point with all the fixings. The yorkie had a crisp exterior but fluffy inside. You can get the gravy on the side (it's a thickish gravy). I would definitely come back for this again.\n\nAlso ordered the Thai mussels ($24) with lemongrass, galangal and garlic toast. Plenty of mussels but this wasn't my fav and I found it a bit too salty and the mussels weren't very tender.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts ($11) with capers, balsamic, and parmesan also leaned into the salty side of things.\n\nOverall, worth a visit for the prime rib at this price point and they also have some happy hour items that looked interesting.\n\nUPDATE July 2024: It's been about 2 months since our last visit here and we decided to come back for their Wednesday prime rib special. We started out with their happy hour calamari ($14) which was better than expected but somewhat salty. The batter was a bit thickish but crunchy and it came with scallions and jalapeños slices.\n\nThe 10oz prime rib is the real reason to visit. We asked for medium rare (I would say it was probably a bit more cooked than that but it's difficult when it comes off a roast). Still, the prime rib was tender to the bite. The yorkies seemed to be more cakey/eggy inside this time around with the inside lacking a light hollow interior (assuming it didn't rise as much as it should have). That being said, it was soft and we enjoyed it. Still good value."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM4RIbfEgZiWLtn1LqfQAL5BcgMy-jbVBWw1FyI\u0026fid=0x0:0x9db4bfc13f087b7d""],""When"":""2024-8-6""},{""Name"":""Alex Kopylov"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXEZ8X4JTTtCM1b8X3zPmW5j15msvWvCXtM7Xsw5rKCihVs4Ji3=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Came here with my girlfriend for her birthday.\nEverything was excellent, our waitress recommended us a west coast salmon and a beef sirloin steak.

Upon our arrival, it became evident that the staff's approach to hospitality involved seating guests in secluded and unappealing areas of the buffet venue. Specifically, an attempt was made to seat my two children and I in an isolated corner outside the buffet hall, adjacent to the gazebo. Despite finding our name listed on the table, it was surprising to discover the absence of chairs, especially given the numerous vacant tables within the buffet hall.\n\nThe highlighted section in the attached image depicts the area where the restaurant manager, Dennis, attempted to seat us.\n\nAfter expressing my concerns to a waiter, we were briefly left unattended as he sought assistance from the restaurant manager. Unfortunately, our situation remained unaddressed as we stood near the gazebo. It was only thanks to the intervention of a kind young lady, whose name I regrettably neglected to note, that we were eventually seated within the restaurant premises.\n\nDuring our interaction with Tatiana at the restaurant, whom I had previously communicated with regarding my reservation, our concerns were adequately addressed, resulting in our relocation to a more suitable seating arrangement within the buffet hall.\n\nFurthermore, our initial encounter with the restaurant manager Dennis, was marred by a lapse in attention, as we were temporarily set aside to accommodate another group of dissatisfied patrons. While I recognize the importance of addressing customer grievances, the manner in which our needs were overlooked appeared disorganized and lacked professionalism.\n\nDespite the exceptional service provided by our waiter, Rishi, throughout our brunch, it was unfortunately insufficient to salvage the overall experience.\n\nIn conclusion, my Mother's Day buffet experience at Acqua Restaurant serves as a poignant reminder of the potential repercussions when customer comfort and satisfaction are disregarded in favor of expediency and indifference.\n\nI encourage prospective patrons to explore alternative dining establishments where all guests are treated with the respect and consideration they rightfully deserve, regardless of party size."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOc0soHiQdoiWE5ZYauQRATx-fNan4YktbQYJEk\u0026fid=0x0:0x9db4bfc13f087b7d""],""When"":""2024-5-13""},{""Name"":""Preethi Nair"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUz8cCAzlnay_PFhvv7Ji00tvlRLoqJA-MhaglfwwGMG6P16JkGug=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Nice restaurant inside Executive suite hotel.

World Burnaby:\n\nThe sole purpose of this review is to assist and friendly remind the restaurant of their inconsistency with this highly rated dish and their response in handling the situation.\n\nPINEAPPLE SHRIMP BALLS - received has NO SAUCE. Called back the restaurant and inquired if they revised the recipe and/or just missing the sauce (comparing to picture shown)?? The staff responded they are certain there is sauce but if still unsatisfied we can pick-up a \""free sauce for our next visit\"" as a solution for missing in this order. Phone was placed on table while inquiring with packaging/kitchen staff that handled the order. Loud strong vocals in Mandarin argumentatively of certainty in preparation and in no way for error..fighting back with FOH staff via convo on phone. Few months earlier, this same situation occured WITHOUT sauce - and when contacted via app, uber just thanks you for your feedback regarding missing sauce (no refund), and left unable to enjoy the dish properly. This is the second time. This is the 2/2 orders we made for this dish and we find this troublesome, time consuming and distressing over a simple dish.\n\nAt the end, drove all the way back to Bubble World Burnaby and they gave a replacement, while showing them the order made incorrectly.\n\nThey suggested for next time to ask uber for full refund on entire uber based on this one dish error. That would completely unfair for the business and I don't recommend doing that in response.\n\nDon't recommend ordering this dish/ Recommend ordering Chicken Nuggets \u0026 Taro Milk Slush instead."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMThQtfoNX2hDtxUoCJa23FdHDbQ16cOcpCc_Vr\u0026fid=0x0:0x554265aac79f232c""],""When"":""2024-10-10""},{""Name"":""Miss Lynne"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXwRhjfH5-OHpuQthobphDEGqrTSpZc4Skj0JUJTU7B1tP8bS8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""My friend \u0026 I was waiting 15mins for seating and I noticed 3 tables available but the girl did not seat anyone.

after more than 20 years. It seems to me that it is now serving a greater variety of food.\n\nPeking duck was the highlight of the evening. It was on promotion and only cost around $55 for a Peking duck in 2 ways. I would say it was very good for this price. The skin was crispy and not too greasy, and the stir fried duck meat with lettuce wrap was delicious. My second favorite was the spicy and sour soup. Though I was a little shocked when I saw button mushrooms in it (the authentic one didn't have), it tasted just like the one I used to have.\n\nPerhaps the chef is not particularly skillful in making Xiaolungbao.

I could see why. Everything was very fresh and I had read the reviews prior to going and the other Google reviews are dead on. After reading those reviews, I was so excited to go. Everything like I said was fresh and high-quality. It is a bit pricey, but worth it, especially in these times.  The service was amazing. I can’t remember the last time I had service like this. Since I’m not Asian, the server came and gave me so much personal attention. She taught me how to use the hot pot,  gave me a bib, even took out my food from the hot pot onto the plate for me. You have to really keep to the two hour time limit though because close to two hours they’re coming and giving you the bill and shooing you out but as long as you know that you need to keep that two hour time limit then it’s fine. The restaurant was very clean and organized. Everyone was very friendly and helpful with smiles on their faces.

The khao gra pao is just okay, I haven’t found anywhere in Vancouver that can make it as good as Pai in Toronto. The mango sticky rice was decent but a touch pricy at $13.

The menu boasts a variety of authentic Thai flavors that are sure to please any enthusiast of Southeast Asian cuisine.

The establishment has a certain charm but feels a bit outdated and could benefit from a refresh. Service can be hit-or-miss, with some days feeling welcoming and efficient, while others leave you checking your watch and wondering if you've been forgotten.\n\nIn summary, if you're seeking delicious Thai food and can overlook the less-than-stellar service and setting, Chad Thai is worth a visit.

In all honesty, both versions were similar in flavour. The good thing is that they know how to make chicken. The outside had a nice crisp to it while the meat on the inside was tender and juicy.\n\nThe following week, I decided to try their Padak Padak ($14 for half order) which is their sweet soy-mustard sauce chicken topped off with green onions curls and added a side of their Shake Shake Fries ($3) with cheese seasoning. I’m sure some people like the cheese seasoning on their fries but it didn’t do too much for me.\n\nOn the good side, the chicken is just as tender and juicy on the inside as on my last visit. However, there’s not much variety here in terms of flavour. Overall, if you like crispy Korean fried chicken that’s tender on the inside, you’ll probably like this place. But you might get bored with the limited variety."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPw7wsxb25Y0d9S6RctmMWyExehq2yBVszoMPAy\u0026fid=0x0:0x4c6eed8474d450ee""],""When"":""2020-10-7""},{""Name"":""Adam Dileva"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVOYiwibK2x6Nw_n7kkQJySxe33AT_eRmRIK-mYuCNUbgx6Iqww=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Wow.

I liked the pork wontons although the meat was packed tight which gave a firm texture."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPCBfCvFWI5NI1iVicnyI8pqCX8q9RLWJaVdq7e\u0026fid=0x0:0x4b00bf75e7768527""],""When"":""2023-4-13""},{""Name"":""Jay Dubya"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXfMlUVFBOTYnkMhZMzBI9QuByFvWzHVqFvyDc6x7TrOUiB7t5s=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Worst take out of the year award goes too:\nChili Dragon.

What you see in the pic is the remainder of what no one would eat after the first few bites. The honey garlic chicken was very bad...and I am not sure what it was because the texture was very weird and the pieces were shaped like a pork chop that was cubed.   The chicken with vegetables was more like 3 day old soup of some kind and the sweet and sour pork tasted like it had been quickly defrosted and dunked in the current sauce then thrown in the container. Both pork's had strangely soft texture and no crispness to be found anywhere. The rice was ok, but it's hard to mess up rice. Truly a waste of $60+ as what you see went in the bin this morning.

This clearly shows how much we enjoyed Cayenne Bistro's food, and their hospitality. I appreciated how they took our feedback seriously and made adjustments to the buffet menu. I highly recommend their Beef kabab, Chicken Rafiki, well-balanced sweet Gulab Jamun, and house-made soft naan. It’s a great spot for hanging out with friends and family. The owners are fantastic—they treat you like family and ensure you're comfortable with both the food and service. I also value a clean restroom, and Cayenne meets that standard. I definitely plan to return for their beef kabab.\n\n4 star review from August 18:\nWe enjoyed the Sunday Brunch buffet on 08/18. Food was fresh, coming hot from the kitchen to our plates. I loved the spring rolls, puri with bateta, kashmiri chicken and sev. Aloo paratha and raita, pickles were ok. I wish they added tea to the buffet. But I must admit the buffet was neat, fresh, non greasy, made my tongue and tummy feel good. This was the third time I had their food. First time we ordered online the Zanjibar Kuku paka platter, a chicken curry with coconut milk comes  with boiled egg and naan. It was tasty,but a bit pricier compared to the qty. Next we visited on a weekend to try the Choma platter. Taste was good, but the amount of rice was very little for this platter. They could have added few slices of naan/roti to complete the platter if not increasing the rice portion.\nOverall good experience. The ambience was nice, saw many people picking up big orders for family gatherings. I must appreciate the hosts -the lady and gentleman, both the owners. They made us felt welcomed, a good host indeed. Hope to visit again to try the appy platter soon."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPxbFuxU9ZmKIIyHPvomBj_DNe1yooJTjR6B2kJ\u0026fid=0x0:0xe0b90bac87ba83e7""],""When"":""2024-8-20""},{""Name"":""elisabeth kaunang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLHXh9nk8bssGh4AgVeZdtpa9EEcQ5OOp-FFyTm761U4MP7jA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had lunch today, because My friend's birthday.\nWe ordered pakora chart,  chicken briyani and beef combo I forgot the name, the foods were delicious combination between Indian and South Africa.\nThe owner was very nice, I will recommend my friend to come there."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPXWGs9DakzJ3ceC7EIwOGQChEFgH6xeuMQ-YLH\u0026fid=0x0:0xe0b90bac87ba83e7""],""When"":""2024-11-1""},{""Name"":""Colleen Holub"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXKO1WzHcSqrCCWQx7vic0N30o2vhvXQFKloHf9C4kWeBcgXu4U=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Our 4 top enjoyed mango lagers, an appy platter and veg pakoras to start.

From past experience, most of these places are just your run-of-the-mill quick sushi places that are nothing to write home about. So I was actually pleasantly surprised by the variety of Japanese fare that FusionCore serves up.\n\nFirst off, this place is quite small and strictly take-out. But that doesn’t mean that they don’t have quality ingredients. I ordered their Aburi Oshi Salmon ($10.50) with torched salmon with jalapeno and special house sauce as well as a piece of Fatty Tuna Belly Nigiri and Fatty Salmon Belly Nigiri ($2.50 each).\n\nJust look at that fatty salmon belly… mmmm! On this visit, I didn’t think the nigiri was as tender as I expected but it was still pretty good.\n\nAburi oshi sushi is a pretty trendy item in Vancouver right now and this was pretty spot on. Definitely going to try some of their other versions in the future.\n\nI came back a few days later to try their Assorted Nigiri ($14.95) which included octopus, fatty salmon belly, salmon, tuna, wild salmon, scallop, surf clam, and fatty tuna nigiri. I think their menu actually said that it should have included tai instead of hokkigai but the surf clam actually was pretty good. This time, the fatty salmon belly and fatty tuna belly were more melt-in-your-mouth. But my favourite of the bunch has to be the hotate… the scallop was so tender and buttery.\n\nOn my next visit, I tried their Aburi Oshi Scallop ($10.50) with capelin roe and avocado… a nice and creamy version.\n\nI liked their Chicken Karaage ($6.95) which had a perfectly crispy exterior with juicy boneless chicken meat on the inside.\n\nI finally tried one of their sushi rolls with a classic BC Roll ($5). A relatively cheap price for a filling roll. If I were to nitpick, I’d say that there was a bit too much rice in the roll for my liking but it wasn’t too bad. I also added a couple of pieces of Salmon Belly Nigiri and Hamachi Nigiri ($2.50 per piece) and I’ve got to say that their nigiri is pretty spot on.\n\nThe one item that I found a bit lacking was the Pork Cutlet Curry ($12.50) that I tried in November. Now, part of this is probably because curry doesn’t travel well in take-out containers. Since they didn’t keep the curry sauce separate, it was soaked up in the rice by the time I ate it. Also, the pork cutlet wasn’t as crisp on the outside as I’d like it to be (again, probably due to the nature of having this as take-out). Also, I felt the pork itself was a bit on the chewy side.\n\nOverall, I’ve pretty impressed with the sushi and sashimi quality here and it’s a great take-out option in the area."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOC2CT7OCXnWBOJC8pUdaz5ETWG-65muY4-FRYg\u0026fid=0x0:0xca745a666fdfe3ef""],""When"":""2020-11-8""},{""Name"":""Joyeeats. ca"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX5pPfXPjXCAKyqZiXyJpDO5kz6nxwzwNADzRj09FgbrU8maWy_=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""📍Fusion Core, Burnaby\n💵 Price: $12 per platter\n🤤Taste: 4.6 / 5\n🕯Atmosphere: NA\n🪑Seating: NA\n📈 Price Performance ratio:  4.9 / 5\nRetention Rate: 100%\n\nℙ𝕣𝕠𝕤:\n🍣 great pricing\n🍣 excellent sashimi to rice to sauce ratio\n🍣 has relatively thick sashimi topping\n🍣 has quite a bit of oshi selections\n🍣 delicious - nothing was disappointing\n🍣 across of Hiel cafe with my favourite soufflé pancakes !!\n\nℂ𝕠𝕟𝕤:\n🍣 take out only\n\n𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:\n🍣 hidden gem!

It sounds like a cross between a fabric store and a place where they serve you a plate of disappointment. But hey, we gave it a shot.\n\nPicture this – you walk in, and it’s like stepping into your grandma’s living room. The walls are semi plastered with photos of ancient island setting, and the lighting is dimmer than their chances of winning a Michelin star.\n\nThe service is friendly, but it’s as if they’ve hired Hermes, the messenger god, to take your order. I asked for a menu, and before I could say “feta cheese,” they slapped it down like a Greek tragedy unfolding before my eyes. Blink, and your wine arrives.\n\nAs for the food, they’ve thrown every Greek dish in the world on this menu. They got your moussaka, your stuffed grape leaves, your ribs, your pastas – it’s a bloody Greek potluck. But the pièce de résistance? The slow-roasted lamb. Apparently, it’s been “the toast of Metrotown” for years. Well, I’ll be the judge of that, the next time I go,  I had the moussaka and I ordered it with the same trepidation as Odysseus entering the cave of the Cyclops.\n\nHere I am, questioning poor Ramie’s and yet secretly harboring a forbidden love for their moussaka. It’s like a tragic romance – doomed from the start, yet irresistible.\n\nLet’s rewind the tape, shall we? Imagine me fork in hand, staring down at that layered masterpiece. The eggplant, the meat, the bechamel – they all whispered sweet nothings to my taste buds. And that sauce! Oh, that heavenly bechamel sauce. It clung to my fork like a desperate lover, promising ecstasy with every bite.\n\nSo yes, my friend, I confess: I loved the moussaka. It was as if Aphrodite herself had sprinkled it with forbidden passion I felt when I visited Naxos with my lover.  Alas, the rest of the dish – the eggplant, the meat, and the bechamel sauce may it forever dance on our tongues, defying the gods themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the wine list could use some work but hey we will definitely be back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNnhQQnXMCTcwCgbtJao3refaDSn7qo10F9chvI\u0026fid=0x0:0xd426c329a9fec480""],""When"":""2024-5-20""},{""Name"":""The Koki Channel"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLYCAfLKhUq--7x95Yhvc2vGemFeI_RXxT_ZXun36dUV2kGKA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Lamb dishes are very tasty.

The tomatoes were fresh and delicious, there was decent amount of cheese. $11 was fair, you get what you pay\n\n🌯Tuscan Chicken Panini ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nHonestly the best looking dish out of everything we ordered.

Willing to make fresh fettuccine when they ran out 🙏🏻 I appreciate that!\n\nOverall:  2/5\n\nA bit pricey for what they served, maybe order their drinks and breakfast.

The space, though is comfortable, easy to find seating in, and feels homey."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNAogmnSTCxPJP-DAzCGzbJWHfo62RwHc7dM7hQ\u0026fid=0x0:0xd5fbbe326624ce2d""],""When"":""2024-5-12""},{""Name"":""John Pavich"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXHek5v_fSX8duNwx8Lk4q5we1_sn_ea56cGbxqkYRBa9BZuAW0LQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This restaurant was sold maybe middle of 2023 and the name has changed will have to check it out.\n\nWe had a group of about 30 people my wife's Zumba friends.

The taste deserves a 5/5 rating.\n\nI think that the portion size of the take out could use a bit of improvement, very little vegetable and more sauce seasoning is needed. I think that the price of around 15$ is fair but is somewhat on the pricey side but then again prices are increasing everywhere and inflation.

Our waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs however, you can tell that she was running around most of the night due to her having multiple tables with large groups. A couple of missed drink orders but totally understandable. We ordered the following appetizers to start: truffle fries, hot wings, lettuce wraps, fresh guacamole and chips. All were good and as expected. For the mains, we all order the 10oz ribeye steak. Everyone agreed that it was tasty and a good sized portion however I found mine a bit salty and garlicky. I would definitely order it again but would request the creole butter on the side. Hence only the 4 stars. We had lots of drinks that were top notch. Started with a few Russel Honey Lager beers to kick things off. Tried a Backcountry Widowmaker IPA which was pretty good as well. Then tried a couple of different cocktails. The ones I’d recommend are the margarita slush, and purple reign.

The pork belly might seem quite greasy but it didn't feel greasy at all when it melted in your mouth. The overall flavors of this noodles are so enticing that I finished the whole thing without sharing with my husband 😂. One interesting thing about this noodles is that you can have a free bowl of rice to enjoy the remaining sauce if you want to. Good for customers with a larger appetite. To me, the noodles themselves are very filling already.\n\nThe soba in soup, according to my husband, has a very rich soup base. It came in nice and hot so he sipped a few spoonfuls before eating the noodles. He found the flavors and the texture of the noodles to his liking.

Instead of tasting fresh and hot. It was lukewarm. The bread that came with the chowder had hard crust. The fries that accompanied our cod tasted like it sat out for awhile.\n\nOur server was nice enough but wasn't pro-active to get us refills. When we wrapped up our meal - he was busy tending to other tables so we had to flag another server for the $110 bill.\n\nLots of areas to improve on to compete with Earls and Tap and Barrel where we typically go!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPjivyJtoNdh6bW-PYiszugweEmPCz6x0aeBu_3\u0026fid=0x0:0x8937a4abaea624bb""],""When"":""2024-11-19""},{""Name"":""Thomas Chen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUITuDRjw9J9Us45xAUXKSfp8lG2sJ2s04TW_lNAi_G6a5d62ur=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I enjoyed my visit to bow and stern very much.

The location is spot-on, and we discovered it the old-fashioned way—not through an ad or review, but simply because it stood out from the street, towering above the neighboring structures. Inside, it’s spacious yet inviting, with an interior design that feels both grand and comfortable. The menu is extensive and diverse. Service was spot-on too. Wade took care of us and did a fantastic job, striking just the right balance between attentive and relaxed. The food itself? No complaints, as everything was beautifully balanced, leaving us fully satisfied. However, the experience wasn’t without its hiccups. Perhaps due to the sheer size of the place, the food arrived painfully slow, even the oysters. And they weren’t even at half capacity, from what I could tell. There seemed to be a bit of a bottleneck between the kitchen and the table, and I could actually watch my coffee sit at the bar long enough to go cold, which is a bit disappointing, especially given the impressive coffee setup they have. I’m hoping these are just teething issues as they figure things out because this place has serious potential. Despite the delays, we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and are hopeful that they will iron out the kinks soon. Burnaby needs more spots like this."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP03Uds5HCB7UR2cKiqKzstc_7kyrlRpZ0PA6He\u0026fid=0x0:0x8937a4abaea624bb""],""When"":""2024-10-2""}]",

I love that they served fresh wasabi because it really enhanced the freshness taste of the sashimi and doesn’t make your nose feel like it just came out of a boxing match! Presentation was on point.

It completed the meal and left me satisfied.\n\nInterior design is modern, unique and definitely a meaning behind the design I’d love to know about it (FYI: each Hello Nori location has a different unique design with the same materials).

slightly salty food, but not the friendliest of service. We went for the happy hour dim sum over the weekend. We made a reservation for 2:15 but since the dim sum happy hour doesn’t begin until 2:30, we were only seated around that time. Whether it was because we came for the happy hour, it was not very clear. Just as we were seating, they asked us whether we wanted tea and walked away without hearing our response which was really rude.\n\nAlso when they gave us the menu, it wasn’t clear which ones were included in the promotion on the menu provided and the server left so quickly we didn’t get a chance to ask. It was 2:40 pm at this point and we were hungry so we just ordered as is from the non-crossed off items.\n\nThe dessert was the first to arrive at the table, before any of the other food, which was unacceptable. Then we got most of the dishes within a five minute span except for one. They didn’t even realize until we asked for it and there was no apologies or anything when we received the dish and that was while we were having dessert.\n\nThey charge for tea and for any take out boxes. I didn’t check our bill well enough to see whether there was a 15% discount accounted for the happy hour."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPSDABhR6r9GCyJAJjq7rnOgGofYR-cP3oZaRdP\u0026fid=0x0:0x7e39e6bd3fc99232""],""When"":""2024-11-13""},{""Name"":""Victor Law"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIpnZPh7heLHnvp3JcjErTq9VzUaFB6LA67FBNyLyGHNyq0kA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba8-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is a higher priced Chinese restaurant, but the quality and proportions make them worthy.\n\nEvery meal that we have had here has been fantastic.

Her professionalism and positive attitude contributed to an inviting and enjoyable atmosphere.

We returned for brunch and had a wonderful experience. Special mention to our server, Ella, who was very attentive with our food, dietary intolerances, and hot water refills. We had the Angus Beef Hash and Blackened Chicken Wonton Soup. The wonton soup was great, but a tad spicy for my taste buds (in the future, I'd ask for the chili oil on the side). They have large TV screens as well, so it was nice to catch some morning hockey while dining! Looking forward to returning to this location in the future, given the exceptional service.\n\nCame here with a group of 8 for an early dinner. We were sat at a higher table with barstool seats, which were hard to move (as they don't glide on the flooring). Being middle-aged, some in the group needed help from others to be \""pushed\"" closer to the table. The food was good. I had the Crispy Cauliflower and Crispy Yam \u0026 Avocado Roll (which was average for the $11 price). The cauliflower had a nice breading and was flavourful, and felt like a slightly smaller portion (\""social hour\"" portion).\n\nWe had some concerns with the lack of service. We constantly had to flag down our waitress as we wanted to place part of our order before 6 pm to take advantage of the social hour pricing. My glass of water never was refilled during the meal. For a large group, it would have been nice to get checked in on from time-to-time, as a courtesy. Because of our group size, we still had to pay the automatic 18% gratuity, but we didn't think the service warranted that amount. The food itself did come out in a timely manner and was done correctly with some diners' special requests. When asked, our server was able to take a group photo of our table.\n\nAmple parking in the parkade below with a 3-hour limit, which I was told was a non-factor after 6 pm when I called the restaurant ahead of time. Overall, we had an average experience! While the food was decent, the service for our larger group left a bit to be desired (3 stars)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMRMdbceD5gvubL_XIV_xZyV73uBO4uvNPN8nFX\u0026fid=0x0:0x1f96fae1d97e6d13""],""When"":""2024-8-30""},{""Name"":""chaitanya gupta"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWP-Cx-tNwiu90cNABgEGrEB8sTBdVTRvK_y-kZN0OvutQ-s073wg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I recently dined at Brentwood - Browns Socialhouse, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish.

This place gets very busy, and for good reason. From the time we arrived and left, the staff of this restaurant were polite, gracious, and happy to help us - so kudos on the excellent staff at our location, including our awesome server Andy. When waiting for your table, you are given access to a small snack/drink bar. When at the table, all the food was ordered off of a tablet, which was convenient, and arrived quickly for us. It was nice of the staff to also give us some fruit for free while waiting. The food itself was a bit pricey, especially some of the meats, but to me, I enjoyed the experience of dining here. Again, excellent service. The noodle dance was a highlight of the dinner. It was nice to see the staff be professional while also having fun with their job. For 6 middle-heavy eaters, we paid around $450 with tips, so expect to pay anywhere between $60 to $100 here per person - excluding if you buy the meats like A5. All in all, HaiDiLao is a five-star, service oriented restaurant that can't receive enough praise for how they operate. You have to try it at least one time, especially if you like hotpot.\n\nAlso, don't forget to use certain codes and phrases when at the restaurant to receive gifts or trinkets.

I ordered the Original (small) and my friend ordered The One (small) with both upgraded to a combo so that we could share an appy (gyoza) and dessert (matcha tiramisu) together. The cucumber salad is a must if you order the combo - the dressing is so simple (sesame oil with salt and pepper) but it's so delicious. For your ramen, you can customize the firmness of your noodles (I usually go firm as thin noodles become so soggy as it sits in your bowl) as well as the richness of your broth and spice level. It was my first time having the tiramisu and it was really good. It's different from a traditional tiramisu and uses what felt like sponge cake instead of lady fingers.

A good ramen place has arrived in Burnaby. Every time I drove by the place, I saw a lineup outside. My friend and I finally tried it out.

The ramen is tasty \u0026 fresh with several choices ranging from how firm you want your noodles to the type of pork. If you don’t like pork or you’re a vegetarian/vegan, this isn’t for you.\n\nFood: 5/5 - We both ordered the house special ramen but had different choices of broth (rich or light broth). There’s also a combo add on you can opt for an extra $5.90. I ordered the Gyoza and salad with seaweed. They advertise the broth is cooked for 20 hours which shows in the broth. All were delish! The prices were reasonable. They offer a small or large portion which the price difference hardly makes a dent in your pocket book.\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5 - nice vibe to the place and it’s clean. If you have more than a party of 4 people, it’s a longer wait. Note: all people must be physically there or they won’t seat you.\n\nService: 5/5 - the servers were friendly and came by frequently offering water. Service was quick \u0026 prompt.\n\nI can’t wait to bring more family and friends here. They’re located outside the Mall on the south side of Kingsway. A side note: they do not accept cash.

Additionally, the broth’s thickness and saltiness can be customized to suit individual tastes. All ramen dishes can be upgraded to a set meal for an additional $5.90, which includes options like gyoza or dessert.\n\nThe gyoza arrived first and impressed with its juicy filling and wonderfully crispy exterior. When the ramen was served, we took our first sip of the broth, which was rich and flavorful, with a deep, savory pork bone taste. The seared char siu practically melted in your mouth, while the lean char siu, which wasn’t rolled before cooking, still had a satisfying texture. The egg was perfectly cooked, with just the right balance of soft and firm.

Original I was geared up to try Kamamarui Ramen around the corner for the first time but they hopped away for the Easter long weekend. (I think they are the last couple of ramen joints I still haven’t try yet).\n\nAnyways, this Maruhachi is located on the same corner block as Boiling Point, Chatime, Meetrice etc, corner of Kingsway and Royal Oak in Burnaby. There are pay street parkings available and if you are lucky there are limited free parking at the back. Typical little ramen joint so usually there’s a little lineup.\n\nHere were what I ordered this time around;\n\n1. Goma-ae. It was a bit rubbery cause when “Yu choy” are preboiled, cooled and stored inside the refrigerator they tend to have that texture after a while.\n2. Gyoza. Nice little crisp underneath but overall pretty basic.\n3. Dashimaki. A little bland, I remember it used to be more flavourful?!?\n4. Tamago ramen. The ramen texture was pretty good, the chashu was a bit dry more like boiled pork than chashu, the broth wasn’t hot.\n5. Chashu tamago ramen. Everything pretty much the same as the tamago ramen except a few more slices of chashu. Once again, “cha shu” means BBQ NOT braised or boiled.\n\nThe service here was decently good and glad to see a full female crew managing this whole operation in a very organized manner.\n\nAs for the food; the food was pretty basic. Honestly, a lot of the ramen places not just this place should really understand the definition of “chashu”?!? Plus lightly seared sliced pork for soup noodles are always more aromatic and flavourful. And unlike beef or pork broth, the creaminess of chicken broth is hard to eat when it’s not hot. The exploration of other choices continue…\n\nP.S. yeah not a bit supporter of businesses that don’t accept cash, cards only.

On one hand, the flavor profile was decent and notably authentic. Unlike some places that add peanut sauce, Maruhachi’s version stays true to its roots, avoiding that inauthentic twist.\n\nHowever, there were several aspects that detracted from the overall experience. The amount of noodles was surprisingly low, and it felt like the abundance of bean sprouts was used to compensate for this shortage. This imbalance made the dish less satisfying.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of meat in the tan-tanmen was disappointing. For a ramen dish that typically includes flavorful ground pork, this omission left the bowl feeling incomplete. Another issue was the ball of black seaweed, which dissolved into the broth, giving it an unappealing burned black appearance. This visual aspect, coupled with the lack of substantial ingredients, made the dish less appetizing.\n\nWhile the authenticity of the flavor was appreciated, the overall execution fell short. A more balanced approach with proper noodle portions, adequate meat, and a more thoughtful presentation would have greatly improved the dish. I would have preferred a more traditional tan-tanmen experience.\n\nFor those in the Metrotown area craving ramen, Maruhachi Ramen may still be worth a visit, but perhaps opting for a different menu item might provide a better dining experience"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMDEgqd8uOEqU9Tx6bgTp2e779brcb77H5IMB6y\u0026fid=0x0:0x2ea298d5694d3331""],""When"":""2024-5-28""}]",

It wasn't too busy and we were able to put in an order without waiting at all. A quick scan of the menu makes you think about other deep-fried chicken outlets like Church's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Popeye's Chicken. We ordered a chicken sandwich and a 10-piece order of regular (not spicy) fried chicken wings, with a Family/Large order of French fries. The service staff was friendly and courteous, and the food came out in a few minutes after we placed the order. We carried away instead of eating in the restaurant because we were trying to get back to the nearby Hilton hotel, but we would have ate the food there, given there were several tables and chairs inside the restaurant (they also have tables and chairs outside on a small patio, if the weather was nicer/warmer). All in all a decent service of deep-fried goodness, but the chicken wings seemed a bit pricey ($18-plus for an order of 10 wings that weren't really that big). Nowhere to park your car except along Kingsway (if that's possible) or one of the side/cross streets."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMTQPb0F6Z6USIK75qpOJtj_9I3hehlP2fCZcgi\u0026fid=0x0:0xd844dd14ce21ca3c""],""When"":""2024-3-2""},{""Name"":""Reda Escaros"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUJ6JK_AzWcA5IOpU4A1k3FXEyBtcc9oS5vU3PaE4gVhERm-ZYh=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Excellent food quality and taste,  service is fast and efficient, the place is clean and tidy, nice patio with lot of space,  good dessert menu,  friendly staff,  convenient location close to skytrain and bus stops, parking at the strip mall next door is free"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMxUu4JCP294YRDyssKYO0B0_NEr3q9u1PA-Vfk\u0026fid=0x0:0xd844dd14ce21ca3c""],""When"":""2024-9-18""},{""Name"":""Jasmine Hue"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKqkEG8hdpj1GWbUCRuCfqshr_1LIMOmkiCQxVcwwWQuNuLbw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Our first time trying with friends.

This smallish shop has a few tables on one side of the store and a stand-up counter on the opposite side. Their menu is fairly basic but odds are that you’re coming here for their noodles.\n\nThe server had recommended that I try their Spicy \u0026 Sour Pork Noodles in Soup ($12) so I took him up on his suggestion. I found that the soup was not overly spicy or sour but it is noticeable (especially if you’re unfamiliar with this combination of flavours). I did enjoy the texture and the varying thickness of the long and wide noodles (I need to work on my noodle pull technique). The dish also contained a small amount of thin beef, cut up tofu puffs, and veggies but it felt a bit sparse.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my meal to arrive, I could hear a loud slapping sound coming from the kitchen… assuming it was from them making their noodles. Overall, I was a bit undecided about this dish so I made a note to come back here and try one of their non-soup noodles to see how that compared.\n\nIt actually took me about 4 months before I finally managed to come back for a revisit and this time I ordered the Fried Beef Sauce Noodles ($12). As expected, the English on the menu isn’t very descriptive but I wound up pleased with this dish. Again, there was the loud noodle slapping noise coming from the kitchen while I waited. And they had to ask me to move over to the counter because a larger party came in after me.\n\nThis bowl had a generous portion of long, broad noodles of varying thickness topped off with well-seasoned fried ground beef, sprouts, and a few pieces of veggies. You have to kind of mix it up before you eat and the sauce was only mildly spicy but I did think this turned out quite good."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOoVqnGVt95tlYxcbm0O34WXMImenZz2Q1fGh6s\u0026fid=0x0:0x508af482b715f32e""],""When"":""2019-6-11""},{""Name"":""Jim Fong"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV3tXWnX8xFhA_qZcSgIAVcjedjNVtb5Riz6aB4ltUNzTkDmgfU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Food were served in plastic takeout containers.

today with my hubby and we wanted to get something for lunch. I googled and found this restaurant. We ordered the #1 Chicken Lemongrass and #7 Deluxe Classic combos (the combo comes with a spring roll and a drink - we chose pop) for 12.20 each combo...pretty good deal nowadays. While we waited for our takeout order, they provided a sample of their new milk tea, that was nice 😋\n\nWe brought the order home and we split the sandwiches. The Chicken Lemongrass had great flavour and the chicken was moist and not dry. The Deluxe Classic was our favourite, I think the seasoned extra-lean pork belly really makes the sandwich and we loved the bread...it wasn't too doughy...the sandwiches had a good proportion of bun to filling ratio. We will definitely go back and bring the kids. The kids are picky with their sandwiches, but I have a feeling they are going to love the choices!\n\nI normally take pictures of the food before eating, but they looked and smelled too delicious...so we gobbled them up.

I didn't know what to expect so I took a handful of banhmi and 2 bottles of their coffee plus a cup Togo.\n\nFirst of all: the price!! So reasonable! It was all I thought about in whistler! There's no such coffee there or banhmi. Or for anything in that price range that taste good. I missed them on the way back too. But since then! I made sure to stop by on all my van city trip!\n\nSame thing here: I flew into YVR from YYZ last week. I wanted some food but didn't wanna go into downtown at 5 pm. Luckily I found this on my way to dinesty dumpling!\n\nThis place was So much nicer than the other obanhmis ( Surrey and downtown Vancouver). Seems bigger. The guy that's working there was super nice too. Even pour me a coffee while I took a video!\n\nThis time around: I'm not messing around. I got 4 bottles of coffee (12 ozs) and 1 banhmi. Coffee matters! They have expiration dates on them and it's actually still good till tomorrow! Not bad at all. I've never stored Vietnamese coffee in fridge before.

It’s quite hidden from the front (behind a bush), so if you’re driving, I’d recommend parking at the back as it’s a busy street (Kingsway) at the front. They already have several locations, but this was my first time trying them. Simple and clean interior with 2 friendly staff when I arrived in the morning to pick up my order. There was a line up (Saturday morning), so I would definitely recommend ordering ahead if you have a larger order and don’t want to wait. I ordered online through their website (they also have a point system, 10 points = 1 free banh mi) the night prior, and set the pickup for 10:15am on a Saturday. I was very impressed by how easy it was to order online, and how accurate the pickup time was - I also received an email update at ~10am notifying me that my order was ready.\n\nMy order:\nLemongrass Chicken: one of my favourites - tender and juicy chicken with pickled vegi’s on a soft bun (chewy outside).\n\nDeluxe Cold Cut: classic banh mi, with several layers of Vietnamese ham \u0026 creamy mayo. This one does not come with pickled vegis, but it’s still one of my top picks.\n\nHoney Garlic Chicken: unfortunately, I couldn’t really tell the difference between this and the lemongrass chicken, but it was still good.\n\nSate Beef: Pieces of marinated beef, subtly on the sweet side. Sort of reminds me of Soo Jerky, but it wasn’t dry.\n\nVietnamese Coffee (bottle \u0026 cup): strong, smooth and delicious. I preferred the bottle as I could save it for later (I mixed it with regular coffee the next day). The cup is ~$1 cheaper, and comes with ice, which waters down the taste if I don’t drink it fast enough.\n\nMango Smoothie: fruity and sweet, blended smoothly\n\nOverall, I’d highly recommend the lemongrass chicken, cold cut and Vietnamese coffee. Super fast \u0026 easy to order online and reasonable prices too."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOuaMbhdJey1NtitMmUE4NjilxGMY_bQbBMnb_I\u0026fid=0x0:0x187a4503ff662ec4""],""When"":""2021-5-22""},{""Name"":""Dan W"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUXA2DDdtmjRKhOMP_NF6SFGgRpZ6b61a-FYx2UfuhcRd6GJ649=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The sandwiches are savoury, crispy, and the ingredients are always fresh.

To my dismay the wrap was icy cold, except for the meat that was slightly warm, the whole wrap was not compressed nor toasted nor nothing!!! No salt, tasteless and to my dismay as soon I unwrapped the top half of the wrap the whole wrap split in half!!! I took a bite and realized the hot sauce was smudged just in the center only. Yikes!! I wouldn't even wrap a dog's food this way forget about giving it to a human! I used to go to Abdul's every time since he opened years ago, but I noticed since he is not in the store himself, it has not been the same. I sure did waste my time, my efforts and of course my money plus a good tip!!. The birds and crows ended up eating my food.

Only 2 tables open for dine-in, but feel free to order take-out or delivery.\n\nMy order:\n\n-Japanese Style Cheesesteak: my personal favourite - juicy sautéed mushrooms \u0026 onions, aged cheddar, wasabi mayo and of course premium ribeye steak slices. It’s saucy, and the cheese blend enhances the flavour.\n-Koagie (Korean Hoagie): Kimchi was good (not too sour or spicy), so I could comfortably eat it.\n-New Yorker: the classic if you don't want to venture away from a\n\""normal Philly cheesesteak\"" - topped with fresh tomatoes and lettuce\n\nOverall, the hoagie roll was soft on the inside, and a good chewy texture on the outside. I reheated mines in the microwave, and it still tasted good several hours later. These cheeseteaks are more saucy than the traditional cheesesteaks, which I personally enjoyed as every bite was filled with flavour. Very filling - best to share if you want to try different flavours. I also really liked their assortment of cheeses (no fake Cheez-Whiz stuff, sorry if you like that though), I think they use aged cheddar, provolone, and some others in a cheese blend. They definitely don't cheap out, and use a generous portion of tender/sliced prime rib steak. All cheesesteaks are made-to-order on a grill when you place your order.\n\n-Onion Rings: skinny-style\n-Deep Fried Pickles: good thick cut of pickles to breading ratio\n-ACC Fries (Garlic Butter \u0026 Parmesan): classic thick cut fries with a very \""potato-y\"" flavour\n-White Chocolate Blueberry Milkshake: quite sweet, definitely for people that have a sweet tooth\n\nAlso, I definitely have to mention the house-made sauces, they're so good for dipping the onion rings, pickles, and fries (cheesesteaks were saucy enough, so I didn't need it there). My personal favourites were the roasted garlic aioli, smoke Chipotle BBQ (not to overpowering or salty), and mustard (real mustard seeds)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPy4x4SxlJVE85YyYd_JGDKxnrGdZkXh6kVcPFk\u0026fid=0x0:0xac3531c6b4a6f4ed""],""When"":""2021-3-11""},{""Name"":""Juan Gonzalez"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW4GoYThNv5wZ68edmUBVHPnkYfRqW2G1JMSLTOd9tKMvLY81AloA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Two things are important about food service: how good it tastes and how much they serve you.

Went with my girlfriend for a lazy Sunday bite. Clean open interior with maybe 6 or 8 seats.

We had the Funghi, which was juicy, flavourful, and full of earthy mushroom umami. The sourdough crust was chewy but crisp the way one would expect. Loved it.\n\nWe also had the Blue Pear and they really nailed the salty/sweet balance of that seep velvety gorgonzola flavour against the sweetness of the pear. So good.\n\n100% recommend. Pies are about $18 to $23 in price, but feel fair given how loaded with toppings and rich with flavour they were.

We should have known that we were going to be very disappointed in the pizzas when we called and the person who answered the phone had to put us on hold while she checked to make sure it was ok for us to order more that 3 toppings on the ‘Build Your Own’ pizza. She said they would allow us to order and pay full price for each of the toppings but the cook would be putting on less of each ingredient. We said that we were paying for the ingredients so we wanted the cook to put them in our pizzas.\nWhen I went to pick up the pizzas i thought I could smell a burnt odour but figured it must have just been the smell coming from the pizza oven. So I left a decent tip and paid for the pizzas.\nI brought them the short distance home and when we opened up the boxes we were shocked to see what they looked like. My husband ordered 4 types of meat with mushrooms and pineapple. I had the gluten friendly crust with prosciutto, chorizo, mushrooms, pear and pineapple.\nWell my husband’s pizza looked burnt around the edges of the crust and the meats were shrivelled and dry. It was hard to find any mushrooms and there were only a few pieces of pineapple. He said it was the worst pizza he has ever tasted.\nMy gluten friendly crust was not made in the restaurant (unlike another pizza restaurant that is nearby and is rather delicious). This crust looked and tasted like cardboard. There is no reason anymore to have bad gluten free products. I’m not completely sure how they managed it but they burnt the crust and all the topping seemed to be barely heated. I can only guess that they cooked the crust (burnt it) and then put on the precooked toppings.\nAlso, if you like lots of pizza sauce on your pizza then don’t order from this restaurant. You could barely see any sauce on either of the pizzas. They call ‘red sauce’.\nI cannot recommend this restaurant. Check out my other restaurant reviews to see which pizza restaurant I do recommend in the Willoughby, Langley area. There are some great restaurants in Langley. This is not one of them. We will not be ordering from this restaurant again. Their location in Burnaby looks like it had great reviews. Perhaps this new location is going through growing pains. We thought we would try this pizza place rather than our favourite because it’s new. We think it was a bad mistake."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMYWKvx8DMoU7TXdt7Cm0c1CBblWzJvFtTDSR2A\u0026fid=0x0:0xd155696a6ad550e1""],""When"":""2024-6-22""},{""Name"":""Rochelle Clarice"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWPmL0BVmEcgub5kZzhoi7c4C1XKJmV2IlzFxr9evuuRLy9PEBEdQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Outstanding!

The salad rolls didn’t seem very fresh, though the sauce was nice. The Saigon crepe looked fantastic with its beautiful presentation and assortment of greens, but it lacked flavor and wasn’t worth ordering. As for the beef skewers, they just tasted like regular sausages, so unless that’s what you’re looking for, I’d skip them. Service was okay, though they forgot to put our drink order through.

I’ve always thought it would be a good idea to try their pho for just $10, but I never had the chance until now. This weekend, I happened to be in Burnaby, so I decided to visit.\nThe restaurant’s walls are quite interesting, adorned with vibrant, colorful paintings of Vietnamese culture and people. When we arrived, there were only a few tables occupied, but the wait for our food was still relatively long. Unlike typical Vietnamese restaurants, there were no sauces on the tables, though they did provide a large pot of tea.\nWe ordered two of their house special soups: Mami’s ‘Real’ Tomato Crab Noodles and the Can Tho Satay Noodles. The crab noodle soup was delicious—not too oily, with a rich, aromatic broth. The crab and pork meatballs were tender and flavorful. However, I wasn’t a fan of the satay noodles. While the broth had a nice satay flavor, the beef slices were overcooked and a bit dry, which didn’t complement the satay taste at all. I ended up only tasting a bit of the soup and meat and didn’t finish it, which was a bit disappointing overall."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPma2zwtAJyNbTVRcifVSC6TaY5paqMXQg6JINC\u0026fid=0x0:0xcd9bae5f68e59356""],""When"":""2024-11-10""},{""Name"":""Peter Lin"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWr0VtxYWL_1hzqRKVbnWoHq8x04Iqx72RF9Y2igxgc1xItxY1HPQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is my first time visiting this restaurant.

Service was lacking and portion sizes were small for the price.\n\nFull review - I ordered a small beef pho but the broth was unfortunately just salty and lacked any depth or proper flavor from the herbs/spices that's traditionally used in Pho. The noodles were overcooked and the meat was just average in quality. Price-wise, at $15+, the portion size was the smallest I've ever seen for a bowl of pho in Vancouver. You can get MUCH better for a lesser price just 2 blocks away in the Lougheed area. Try Pho 99 or Pho Capital.\n\nService-wise, there were 2 staff I interacted with - a girl in her 20s that managed the place and a middle-aged man who's supposedly the cook. Upon seeing me walk in, she didn't bother greeting or even looking at me but grabbed a menu and nonchalantly asked me to sit anywhere. From ordering to payment, it was almost as if she didn't want to be there and/or was standing in for someone else, with almost 0 regard to customer service. The cook brought me my food, and did so without even a word or a greeting; one could fairly assume he's mute.\n\nI don't know where the other reviews are getting this excellent service, delicious food or big portions they speak of, but clearly my experience today was lacking. Ignoring all else, even for just the food, I'd say just avoid this place altogether and go 2 blocks south for a MUCH better experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipObIwvv1rxQJFdQ1i3f5MU6vbrRIaevH7z4QUU\u0026fid=0x0:0x297c29da31d94ee6""],""When"":""2024-1-28""}]",

We said yes and he then further asks if we want lobster and crab, which is when we start to feel uncomfortable. We were there for a casual dim sum, not to spend big bucks on seafood. Turns out the HALF chicken was $33.80. Which is 3x the price of any other dish we got. We had 3 adult and 1 child and end up spending $45 per person including including the child. It is also worth noting they charge 2% service fee if you pay by credit card. This is just bad service. You can charge more per dish, but don’t nickel \u0026 dime me like this.

Most items were top notch as can be expected from Neptune and included a light passion fruit mousse which was not too sweetor too tart. The deep fried taro dumplings with pork and fried shrimp had the prefect creamy consistency. Steamed bean curd wraps had big shrimp filling inside. Also enjoyed the chiu chow dumplings and the baked bbq pork buns with cookie top. Rounded out our meal with the lychee and mango rabbit and the Chinese donut rice roll (liked the green onions but the Chinese donut wasn't crisp enough).\n\nUpdate: Feb 26, 2024\nBack in late February, Grand Neptune was heavily promoting a special AYCE king crab at $200/person. We obviously couldn't eat that much king crab to make it worthwhile so we went with their ala carte pricing of $26.99/lb. That pricing is the best I've seen in years and was only available for a week.\n\nThis was one of the better king crab meals that I've had for a long time. We opted to have it prepared steamed with garlic for the legs, spicy fried knuckles, and with baked Portuguese rice in the shell. Each dish was great but we were really impressed with the rice... creamy and full of shrimp, scallop, and king crab meat. We added a dish of stir fried pea tips in garlic sauce and they were nicely prepared and crisp to the bite.\n\nThe king crab was 6.75lbs which worked out to $182.18 + $25.88 for preparing it and and extra $38.80 for the Portuguese fried rice (well worth the price).\n\nUpdate: Mar 10, 2024 Another visit for dim sum...\nChiu chow dumplings $9.80 had large filling contained in the thin wrapper.  Mango pudding was sweet and refreshing $8.35. Deep fried pork dumplings (aka footballs) had a nice crisp which contained the mochi-like texture surrounding the pork filling $9.8. The bean curd wrap dumplings $10.80 had big filling a well and turned out perfectly.\n\nPan fried shrimp and chive dumplings $10.80 were good but I actually liked it better when I mixed it with the ginger and green onion sauce that came with the crab. Oh, did I mention they did a good job of convincing us to get their crab special?\n\nI mean, $20 for a ginger and green onion crab is a pretty good deal. Even though the crab wasn't huge, it was well prepared.\n\nWe also wound up ordering the strawberry coconut bunny $7.95 as they had a guy carrying these around to the tables. It was cute and jiggled to the touch. Not much strawberry flavour tho.\n\nUpdate September 2024:\nOrdered the steamed spicy beef tripe which was both tender and spicy. Eggplant with shrimp paste was good too. Chiu chow dumplings, pan fried turnip cakes and mango gelatin rounded out our meal."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMyo79tWWIJJqGPzTOtzV4wp_Y7hJ-oHOtJSSV5\u0026fid=0x0:0xe6f3e47e2e7b6766""],""When"":""2024-3-14""},{""Name"":""Ping D"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV-_KBk5-yIGzGmKAkX1L-6QPRrz_RZKkgRnIY4il5exhoL_sw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Large menu selections and appealing dim sum.

The dipping sauce could be better though. It was rich in peanut flavor but nothing else.\n\nThe chicken wings were very small compared to those served in other Vietnamese restaurants. They tasted alright, for the record. The batter was not too thick and the meat was tender.\n\nThe most impressive thing about this restaurant might be the variety in its menu. It serves Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese noodles plus some other food.  So what you look for is choices, this is it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNseGqWkCWEiBcqCa9Ijmw7i0rqfzEVvbOevco_\u0026fid=0x0:0x2bf2f49774396076""],""When"":""2024-9-6""},{""Name"":""Ben Lee"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLByaKCpGbuY489WAdVXd-pZWeXBz9NdVZAA2yg17Co0zS8zQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Checked out the house special fried rice: lots of toppings, and with prawns and flakes of fish.

My kids finished it in less than 5 min.

No bamboo shoots or onions or peppers. And the eggplants were fried too dried. However, the sauce was good.\n\nThey have 3 sizes of Pho , small, regular and large. We got a large one but feels very small (noodle portion) was just about a small bowl.\n\nServing dishes are nice.\n\nSalad roll has a “non traditional” peanut sauce which was not my favourite.

However, the food—specifically the burger—fell completely short of expectations.\n\nI ordered the \""The Big Dipper,\"" and while it looked visually appealing, the first bite was utterly disappointing. Despite the use of Brant Lake Wagyu Beef, the patty was dry, overcooked, and flavorless. Honestly, it was the driest burger I've had in the past 10 years living in Metro Vancouver—worse even than a day-old burger from Wendy's. It was so dry that I couldn't believe it had just been cooked.\n\nThe situation only worsened when a male staff member, who appeared to be the manager, came over—not to apologize, but to offer an explanation. He cited BC regulations, claiming that burger patties must be cooked to medium-well. However, what I received wasn't even medium-well—it was overcooked to the point of being inedible. He also insisted that the burger looked \""juicy\"" to him, which was absurd. If this was the result of following regulations, then I wonder how other burger restaurants manage to serve juicy patties while adhering to the same rules.\n\nIn the end, the male manager waived the charge for the burger, but he offered no apology—just excuses. I have to ask: was this burger truly worth selling? Was it something to be proud of? This meal completely ruined my evening. In the 30 minutes we spent at the restaurant, the only thing I managed to eat was the truffle fries.\n\nThis was an incredibly disappointing experience. If this is the standard for the burgers and service at this establishment, I will not be returning to Bin4."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO9WW2pYrkwOp27gx0H9ltMpvx0Hz9Jqk3uH_af\u0026fid=0x0:0x37e0badfec615773""],""When"":""2024-12-20""},{""Name"":""Abster"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLblDdaXM3P5dLALJmhM2ZaQhcLRR8T_uEtXh193o0J0BeuZQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""WOW, what an experience. I got the Blackened Chicken with Cheddar Salad through Uber Eats for $23.50, expecting a hearty, satisfying meal. Instead, I was served a “chicken breast” so thin, it was actually thinner than the cheese slices in the salad. Seriously, how is that even possible? If you’re going to charge $23.50, at least make it feel like I’m eating actual chicken, not something that’s one step away from dissolving in the dressing.\n\nBut then we get to the root of the problem—literally. Along with my salad, I received a lovely surprise: a giant root covered in mud. Apparently, the “farm-to-table” concept here skips the crucial step of washing the ingredients. Maybe I was supposed to be charmed by the authenticity of dirt in my meal?\n\nThis was a disaster from start to finish.

Where shall I start? Ordered a three piece combo, for take out. and later when getting ready to eat, I opened the box and found only two pieces. Then, one of those two pieces was a half-drumstick - literally half of it was broken off! (In the photo is the bone of a whole drumstick - looks deformed!)When I went back to ask what they can do, she said I can only have a two piece. Basically, to compensate for me having to spend as much gas just to go back there I was not even breaking even. Then, to begin with,  I was told I could choose a fountain drink or bottled pop as part of my combo, so I chose the bottled pop. I noticed how we an Additonal charge of 50 cents on the till. The cashier did not say it was “extra” just that I could choose between the two. So, I said never mind then. I will have a fountain drink. Then she goes “oh, that’s out of order, have a bottled drink then. Hmmm, it was what I wanted after all but kinda makes you wonder about her saying “you can choose” between them. Why did I give two stars vs one? The one normal piece of chicken I actually ate, it was quite good.\n\nUpdate: Because this place is so convenient I went again, but yet again, I was disappointed. Similar to last time it was poor service and substandard chicken. The three pictures added is a view of the tough leathery surface of a chicken thigh underneath the crispy skin.  When I complained and showed the piece to the lady at the counter, she  said “but you ate most of it and then found out?”  Hmmm. So I peeled back more of the crispy skin to show her the full scope of the tough surface. Only then did she reluctantly give me a replacement piece. Not sure about how common this is, but never have I ever gotten chicken like this anywhere else - not Churches, not KFC, and certainly not Jollibee."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBYPI4xcDnG-LCCaS3ORoEnGsXJaRElj3bGDNG\u0026fid=0x0:0x1d3f24bc3ca4a38c""],""When"":""2022-8-7""},{""Name"":""Evangelina Y.
