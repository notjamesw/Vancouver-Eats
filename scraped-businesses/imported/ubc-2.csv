place to visit, and I urge you to, especially for their pizzas. However, as great as it tastes, it is clear that over the two years I have been going there, the amount of arugula they have been adding has decreased drastically.\n\nMaybe it is just shrinkflation, or maybe nobody likes arugula, but regardless, that is disappointing nonetheless.\n\nStick to the pizzas with pesto or tomato sauce, they are absolutely amazing, the ones without are quite bland.\n\nThe crust is some of the best you’ll ever taste, or maybe all my years of never trying pizza this fresh ruined my tastebuds.\n\nIf I were to recommend a particular pizza, it’d definitely be the pesto pollo! It’s simple, pesto with chicken and mushrooms but it is a joy to eat.\n\nThe pizza is quite fast, cooked in around 10 minutes, and there are plenty of seating as well.\n\nI tried the pasta once when it first came out… and it was basically just reheated in a shoddy take-out container. Incredibly disappointing compared to the pizzas.\n\nThe mini caprese salad has the best sauce I’ve ever eaten, so even if the price is a bit steep, worth it imo.\n\nAnyways, please visit!

The ordering counter is downstairs with a seating area upstairs. It wasn't particularly clean: some tables had crumbs and there was trash on the floor under some tables, which weirdly is carpeted. The furniture, however, is in good condition and comfortable.\nFIRST VISIT: I had a felafel plate and a rice pudding. The food was average quality. The sauces they use are a little different than the typical sauces: the white sauce was thicker and tangier and the red sauce had a hint of heat but mostly tasted like a zestier and thinner version of ketchup (this is maybe not the most appealing way of describing it - it was good, like a cross between hot sauce and ketchup). I liked the different flavours and the rice was actually pretty good, but I was indifferent about the felafel and hummus. The felafels were like the puck-shaped ones you can buy at the grocery store. The rice pudding had a nice flavour but was almost gelatinous in consistency, which I can't decide how I feel about.\nSecond visit: I wanted to see if the more distinctly Persian dishes would be better, so I tried the eggplant stew, the one veg stew on the menu. The “broth” that the eggplant and tomato were stewed in was straight oil, which I did not like. Again the rice was great, but they give so much with the stew that I didn’t know what to do with it all.\nThe prices ($17 for the plate and stew w/ rice, $5 for the rice pudding) are fair for the amount of food you get, which is pretty generous. I finished the whole felafel plate but was very hungry, so if you have a smaller appetite you will have leftovers. Two people could easily split a rice pudding.\nThe staff seems very nice, but I just can’t see myself coming back for the food. I’d get the felafel again if it was the ONLY place to get felafel in town, but it is very much not."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNY72ngJ2ZaAwXFb3jb_xOhzFGMNLItp0KiPLjO\u0026fid=0x0:0x615e3b717137617d""],""When"":""2024-1-12""},{""Name"":""Abdullah K"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVaOLs3U1NGAh-EH96OS0WG3dhkXXnjYtovUMs7UYINOdg16mA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This is my go-to place to eat on and around campus!

I wouldn't go here as a night out, but at the right times, it's a chill hang. The atmosphere varies wildly depending on the day. On some nights it's louder and is in line with what you'd expect a university bar to be like, and sometimes it's very relaxed, and you can even find some people using it as a study spot (not something I would consider or really recommend, but you do you as long as it's not busy and no one needs the table). Sometimes it's somewhere in between or a weird mix of both. It's not always predictable, but I've found that to hit the quieter days that I prefer, early evening during exam season at school is best, and summer in general are chiller than the main academic year.\nThe food is good, often surprisingly good. The menu items are well thought-out and tasty, and nicely presented. It's not a veg-centric establishment but there's lots of choice for vegans! Off the current menu, I've had the Power Punch Salad, the Vegan Pulled Jackfruit, the Vegan Burger, Vegan Chick'n Caesar Wrap, and the Tempeh Teriyaki. I wasn't particularly impressed by the Caesar wrap - it wasn't awful, I just didn't feel like it was worth $19.5, but everything else was a delight. I'm glad their vegan burger is a (seemingly) housemade, minimally processed black bean patty instead of beyond meat or similar! I usually won't order a salad as my meal, but the Power Punch is substantial! The side salad that comes with the sandwich orders is actually pretty nice too.\nThey make good cocktails and have a long list of local draft beers on tap which I haven't really had a chance to dip into, but I got the \""Green Bird\"" for fun on St. Patrick's Day, which is just a version of their house \""T-Bird\"" lager that's been coloured green (maybe naturally, judging by the grassy notes I got from it, but I don't know for sure). It was actually a good lager though!\nSometimes the staff is nice enough, sometimes I get the vibe that they're too cool to be serving me or something, but because the only interactions you have with them are when you order and pay at the bar and when they bring your food out, an unenthusiastic bartender doesn't ruin the whole experience. Because of this service style, you can expect to be in and out of here faster than you would at a full table service restaurant, but it's not fast food, so dishes still take as much time to prep as they would at a \""regular\"" sit-down place. It's also pricier than typical counter service food, but very reasonably priced compared to off-campus restaurants that serve food of this quality, and there's no obligation to tip 20%. To me, the service model, fair prices, and high quality are a combination of the best elements of counter service and full service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOQwEdJ88aXsSlarpRs-9jcRwBTBo0B-hIa3KfE\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b84d3debc8f1cec""],""When"":""2021-4-19""},{""Name"":""Steve Morgan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmgrmzSyB3CC_qWamR3pXmaZna6-RxfqDluiFzTGNrypDReGc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very large service area.

The other reasons include that there just isn't that much choice on campus and the food is basic but decent here. The view is nice if you're out on the patio. And there's a lot of space. It's very sad that the sit-down nice restaurant didn't make it because that's exactly what the area needs. They just didn't promote it and since this is the top floor, no one discovers this space by walking by. The service at the Gallery when it was in the old sub was never this sad.

The chipotle dip was a nice addition, though it's not very spicy. The pizza itself is juicy and full of flavors.\n\nIf you were to compare it to an authentic Italian restaurant in Downtown, I can't say for sure how it would hold up—I haven't tried that yet. But this place serves great pizzas with good quality. As long as the quality stays consistent, it will always be one of my favorite pizza places.\n\n[Update, July 1, 2024]\nWe ordered an extra-large half-and-half pizza. One half was Sweet \u0026 Spicy Lovers, and the other was Eggplant Artichoke. We enjoyed both. The Sweet \u0026 Spicy Lovers pizza has pineapple slices, so if you enjoy the sweetness of pineapple on your pizza, it could be really nice. The spiciness comes from banana peppers, which are quite intense—I’d rate the spicy level 9/10 and usually avoid the banana peppers with the last pieces.

Finally stopped in to try their Indian food for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. I had the Kadhi Onion Pakora Chawal and it was so good. Nothing too fancy, but just excellent Indian comfort food. I’m not in a place to say whether Indian food is “authentic” or not, but this was not the relatively bland take on Indian food that you might expect from this unassuming brunch place, it was pleasantly rich. And the paratha was so soft and flaky! The portion was also very filling, so good value for your money. I like that the Indian section of the menu has so many (vegetarian) breakfast dishes that most Indian lunch/dinner restaurants don’t serve. I’m kind of curious about the Western brunch menu too, but will definitely be back to try more of the Indian food if nothing else.\nI had a Piña Colada smoothie too. It wasn’t bad, but it didn’t really do anything for me. They called this a “fruit smoothie” but it was so sweet and tasted closer to a flavoured slush to me. I'd skip the smoothie next time since the main meal was enough.\nThe atmosphere is totally bare-bones, it’s not sketchy or anything, there’s just absolutely no ambiance to speak of. The staff was nice enough though, especially the person taking orders at the front. It’s not a hip brunch place at all, but a great place for some no-fuss good eats. Although I can’t speak for the Western brunch stuff, I can definitely recommend you check them out for the Indian dishes if you live around UBC."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOGkL616_ijo3iJGYtqCaMmv43q99ohyD-11woA\u0026fid=0x0:0x235021b24bb8028f""],""When"":""2022-9-11""}]",

Unfortunately, the policies have changed and a beverage and gratuity is added, very fair, since I was told that some didn't tip, so the policy changed from this week. From this visit, the sauce amount has decreased, and the pasta has gone from al dente to harder, basically raw pasta.\n\nThe first plate of pasta was almost perfectly al dente but still slightly under what I preferred, and was still a treat to enjoy.  After the first plate, I had asked if the pasta could be made softer for the next.  They said that it would not be possible since the pasta is par-cooked.  However, for the next 2 plates, the pasta got harder and harder until I tasted flour and I decided to cut into one.  Well, it was raw inside (photo included).  At this point after 2.5 plates of hard pasta, I didn't feel like asking for it to be remade since they told me before that it wasn't possible.\n\nOverall, the food experience was marginally unacceptable after the first plate. The service was good and the sports bar atmosphere was excellent.   I recommend the rigatoni alla vodka sauce for the all access pasta since it tastes the best, pesto the second.\n\nAfter the complaint, I was told there had been a miscommunication that the pasta couldn't be cooked longer, and the drink cost was taken off as a result."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMb5h3FMgcqIKIxfIJ4PYZyyEEGjALlZXy1MfK1\u0026fid=0x0:0xfbcd82c95f6df084""],""When"":""2024-10-23""},{""Name"":""Simon"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWq3mMD7x0QRiQPROCB5BEqtJbykKAfvm5IFcPhyVt8QiitDIxq=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I got introduced to this place by a foodie influencer  (Howie) and got to enjoy a lot of their food.

The pastas and flatbreads are heartier fare than you’ll find at most of the coffee shops (UBC-owned or not) around campus, and my pasta and (big) cookie today came out to about $14 total.

I am also grateful for the non-metal chairs!\nIt was 27°. We've just been cooling in the forests of the beautiful UBC Botanical Garden and not quite ready to drive back to the city. Westward Ho at the UBC Golf Course came up on my Google search for brunch. Their patio picture was the deciding factor. Since it was nearly Happy Hour, the pub wasn't crowded and we were able to get a table in the impressively big patio. Not sure if it would be equally impressive had it been a really sunny day. We'd have to check that out another time. On this cloud day, the patio was very bright – almost to the point where I have to put on my sun glasses.\nAs for the food, we had a hard time choosing: fresh fish and chips, fish sandwich, Beyond Beef burger, all day breakfast, etc. I ordered a Club House with multigrain yam fries, my companion ordered fresh Cod and Chips. The bread in my Club House was dried out, the sandwich did not look as scrumptious as the one with sour dough presented to the table next to us. My sandwich was too 'orderly', the chicken did not spill out of the sandwich like the one I saw earlier. I enjoyed the cod fish though – very fresh and not over battered. So, I guess I ordered the wrong thing! I liked the choice of using vinegar on coleslaw instead of mayo. A decent size coleslaw for a more balanced meal. MSG? For a few hours afterwards, I was very thirsty, but did not get the usual sickly feeling from eating MSG. So, not sure what was in the food that caused my tongue to feel so dry."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNjr8zNCvHQWWPDvIvCsF-m8vfK6OTg8xyORYzH\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2021-8-2""},{""Name"":""Azi Jahan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVoCqSGFWxXVxJxNnyUrYmJjWJKEtREeG-G0RXpmBRv8kbELxEL=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""For gulf lovers for sure, it's a well-known place.\n\nBeautiful location and view🤌🏻\nDelicious brunch\nSo kind and supportive staff\n\nIt's a peaceful weekend brunch location if you are looking for a calm weekend's brunch🤩"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP4NKPC_4N4_VYCzznfOGLy34Q4VWIecJtPF0BY\u0026fid=0x0:0xb49fce853972ff8d""],""When"":""2022-7-29""},{""Name"":""Paul Rogers"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI-2DEuMMhV7vJRExrjz5OPFG99Ya8EpWqhlLnkXnZqRJpDqw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""My family went here with a few other people for dinner.

I’m just more familiar with Cantonese food) and it was so good and very large and filling.  I like their noodles which have a bit of a chew (look hand pulled rather than the skinny noodles you might expect normally in Dan Dan).  They were the same type of noodles in the meat sauce noodle dish (no soup).  The fried chicken is super crunchy so worth a try if you like fried chicken but I’m not looking for such an oily lunch/dinner.  Everything is fresh because it’s made to order.  They are open at night too. Looks like several of the other food court stalls did not open much.  Best thing to eat on the whole campus in my opinion.

I’ve been here a couple times now with friends and the service staff are completely indifferent/unfriendly, the place seems disorganized, and it does not feel remotely comparable to any other Chipotle location I’ve been to. The portion sizes are not consistent from visit to visit and it seems as though the staff have taken some creative liberties as to how portioning and presentation should look. Every time my friends and I have visited this location, we have had to ask for more lettuce. They sprinkle it in the corner like it’s a garnish (picture attached was after asking for more). With the other toppings (corn, cheese) as well, they sprinkle minuscule portions with their fingers instead of using a standardized measuring device. I’ve only been during lunch rush, but I feel they start heavily skimping so that they have to do less prep or worry about changing containers mid rush. They do not follow “fifo” procedures (first-in, first out) and my friend and I (who both have experience in the food service industry) watched them on multiple occasions just dump new prep on top of older prepped toppings instead of switching containers. It’s about half the portion of food you’d get at any other Chipotle, which is a shame since you’re paying the same $17-$20 price tag. Seeing more experienced individuals in food service or service management at this location would be nice, in place of the youthful and evidently lacking in training/experienced staff at present. My friends and I have been here 3-4 times now but I don’t think we will continue as it stands.

The chairs inside are small, and the space feels somewhat cramped.\n\nThe prices for the food are on the upside as per usual for restaurants near the university campus. Both my friend and I ordered the Pork Original with thick noodles. The portions were small (somewhat little noodles, two pieces of pork), but the thick noodles and broth tasted great. Service was fast, but servers are friendly and attentive.\n\nOur final bill came around to around $40 dollars which can be quite expensive for students or those living on campus in student housing. If the portions were more and the prices were cheaper, I will be returning here for more food. I would recommend people to try out this restaurant if they have not before, but not to rely here for a full stomach.\n\nThe washrooms are clean. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible, but the space is cramped and washroom are also small. There is underground parking quite close."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM1m_bO2WcI2xuf2eO5LkkMFM0jEGbqyphVHSSq\u0026fid=0x0:0x50d70a428840f326""],""When"":""2024-4-10""},{""Name"":""Keith Ver"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXVdqxLCf1LEt0AU82myo-eUqDcb2LcbdnfhupJTEW0sPAQ-qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Absolutely loved the Beef Original ramen!

The menu was large, not overcrowded with menu items, and easy to follow. I ordered Bento Box A with beef (roughly $14) to go. I went at around 3pm on a Sunday, there were a few tables inside and I waited for just over 10 minutes for my food, which was a little longer than I had expected.  The packaging for takeout was pretty meticulous with everything being packed nicely in a large brown paper bag. The food was the typical bento box style food but everything was quite tasty. The beef to rice ratio was a bit lacking but the beef had adequate flavor and the added tamago (sweet eg) was a nice bonus. The California rolls were pretty good and the assorted tempura was light and did not leave an oily taste layer in my mouth.\n\nOverall, a pretty good first experience here at this new establishment on campus.

Instead, we ended up having lunch here. We should have eaten at the festival.\n\nThis is an imitation Phở restaurant or a Phở-wannabe restaurant. Their phở soup tasted nothing like authentic ones. It also has no Vietnamese phở names, like Bún Bò Huế, Phở tái Nam, or Phở bò viên, for example.\n\nMy $18.50 \""Spicy Beef Noodle Soup\"" tastes somewhat similar to Bun Bo Hue but lacks all the major ingredients found in real BBH. It only comes with meatballs and beef slices typically used in Hot Pots or Shabu Shabu. 😅 The taste is also very mild in comparison and lacks any herb flavor.\n\nThe $19 \""Special Noodle Soup\"" is laughable, not even close to any beef pho we have ever tasted. But nothing is worse than what I am about to say....\n\nIn both the noodles, the beef slices were HOLY SH*T!! - SO MUCH FAT! 🫣😮‍💨😵 There were less than half edible meat portions in each slice. Don't know if we should ROFL or go postal. Either way, one of the worst beef phở we have ever eaten in the world (only two other phở restaurants in the world are worse than Phở With Us', and we have eaten many phở in many, many countries in our world travels!)\n\nThree hours later, my stomach was growling and I had to eat a full meal. Therefore, Pho With Us' pho is considered a snack. $19 FOR A SNACK. Sheesh!!!\n\n.\n\nPicture 1: $18.50 \""S1 Spicy Beef Noodle Soup.\"" Doesn't look greasy initially.

Even though the tofu and spring rolls were deep-fried, the dish didn’t have an oily taste. I saved one of the spring rolls for later and was still very full - I could have gotten two light but complete meals out of this if I hadn’t gotten excited and eaten so fast to start out with. The tofu pudding was okay, kind of bland. I haven’t had a dessert like this from a Vietnamese restaurant before so I don’t know how it usually should be. I appreciated that the ginger syrup wasn’t too sweet but I would have liked the ginger to be stronger. This was also a large portion so I took half home.\nLike other restaurants in University Marketplace, the environment is rather cafeteria-like, meaning not much ambiance to speak of, but the people who run it are nice and hard-working.

Being built in 2016/2017, OC's dinning hall has a main seating area and another room for additional guests.\n\nThe atmosphere is really spacious and the architecture allows for great  natural sunlight. The seating there can sit 200-300 people. At regular meal time, 8am -9am, 11am to 12pm, 6pm to 7pm, expect there to be lots of people.\n\nThe food there is okay and there is variety there every day. The portion is small (all-you can eat, but you get pre-allocated portions) so you can get multiple kinds of food. Sometimes, the food is too saulty or the tasting is off. The dinning hall is open from 7am to 10pm every day, but the food may not be plentiful or have great variety when you come to eat outside of regular meal hours.\n\nThe pricing is cheapest around breakfast at around $12. Lunch is $16 and dinner is at $20. The food is all you can eat. If you have a UBC meal plan, then you can go to OC as many times as you want and are unlimited in entries. If you have residence meal plan, then the cost would not matter to you. You are not charged per entry, but charged for the entire meal plan as a whole.\n\nFor food options there, you can expect salad bar, yogurt ball, vegetarian options for food, stir-fry grill, and burger grill. There are fresh fruits like apple, bananas, oranges and plum. There is tea, coffee and juice available. Their Philly cheesesteak sandwich and burgers is good.\n\nTo know the menu of OC, you can download an app to see their menus. Their lunch and dinner menus are the same."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP0aPX-vNdBTU_jqkiXOSgJRpgqyUEHS9HhAyML\u0026fid=0x0:0xd0113f8377d90e0c""],""When"":""2023-9-13""},{""Name"":""yoyo huang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVHfL3bnaoL_4LM9Q6GkGocV7c7Sko1louBNBsuDc0OrdaDTJLa=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""The food here is very unstable, sometimes good, sometimes bad.

Curiston pulled out her phone and recorded the encounter, which ended when a kitchen worker grabbed the rat with a pair of tongs. The critter fell to the floor, and the worker carried on with his duties.\nDinner service continued, but UBC told CTV News the grill station was immediately closed down and sanitized, and all the food was thrown out.\n“(We) are working actively with our pest control partner to address the situation,\"" said Colin Moore, director of UBC Food Services, in a statement to CTV News. \""All employees have been informed and reminded about proper sanitation measures as necessary,”\nUBC also confirmed Vancouver Coastal Health has since inspected the cafeteria, finding no evidence of rodent infestation and saying it’s content with the school’s sanitation and pest control measures.\nStudents living in several residences at UBC pay for a meal plan, which gives them credit to buy meals at school cafeterias and restaurants. Curiston wants UBC to consider giving students some form of a reimbursement or meal voucher, saying despite health inspectors signing off on the cafeteria’s cleanliness, the image of a rat in the kitchen will keep her from dining there for some time.\n“I refuse to go back until I know for a fact they’ve dealt with the rat problem,” she said. “If they set out traps, I’d feel more safe eating there.”​"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNdu1L40XRvbU__oyjBuTwVZOpwceqlwIHYwesg\u0026fid=0x0:0xd0113f8377d90e0c""],""When"":""2022-1-20""}]",

I am messaging regarding an incident which happened at the after party of the holi event. I arrived to the party with my group consisting of both boys and girls.

There was a guard/bouncer, wouldn’t know what his designation was but the moment we arrived he targeted me stating that “you are too intoxicated to go inside”, mind you he let my other friends pass. I tried to reason with him that I was not intoxicated but he didn’t budge. I tried to come around a few times and the third time I tried there was someone else who let me in asking what the problem was. Clearly the person who let me in saw that I was not intoxicated. He even made a joke about it and we all laughed. This was already very insulting and humiliating for me. Later when we were inside the man again targeted our group but this time he pointed out to another guy that he’s intoxicated. Funny thing the guy he pointed out doesn’t even drink. It clearly shows that the man’s ego got hurt because the other guy let us in. He kicked my friend out solely on assumption that he was drunk. He even accused us of teasing girls. That was completely uncalled for. I have no idea why he was targeting us but he ruined our night, wasted our time and money. I am messaging this to you so something can be done about it. I cannot emphasise more on the point of it being absolutely humiliating. I hope you question that person or at least some action is taken against him.

Firehouse Subs. Wow!! They’re so good. First of all, the best staff ever at the UBC branch—thanks for all the hard work there.

We loved them so much that we ordered again the next day—one Steak \u0026 Cheese and one Pepperoni Pizza Meatball—and again, we loved those. We’re probably going to keep ordering until we find our favorite. So far, we like these four in this order: Montreal Smoked Meat, Steak \u0026 Cheese, New York Steamer, and then Pepperoni Pizza Meatball. All of them are 7.5/10 or higher, so they’re really close. The pepperoni one is at the bottom of the list because the marinara sauce was a bit overwhelming, making it hard to really get to the pepperoni and meatball.\n\nWe also ordered the chili bowl and garlic bread. The garlic bread is nice—normal garlic bread. You could get creative and make it a bit more interesting, but I kind of liked it with their special sauce. But the chili bowl is on another level—so good.\n\nAs you can guess, I’m definitely going to keep trying them again and again. Hope they keep up the good quality. 🥖 🚒 🔥\n\n[Update, 2024, Aug 15]\nOrdered two new subs:\n1. Hat Trick Sub: A bit too much barbeque sauce, if you like bbq sauce a lot go for it.

The only thing I should mention, is I ordered a tuna (now I'm not sure why it wasn't on the board, but unfortunately there are some adjustments that could be made to the recipe. It might be, because when I enjoyed the sandwich, it was very wet, which tells me that when it was taken out of the can the fluid wasn't drained. So the Mayo is that was added was diluted a lot, Celeste liquid more mayo, as well the sandwich does need mustard for a tuna, and some black pepper would be ideal and a little bit of salt to bring out the flavor. )which was not on the board and I nearly walked out, except for the fact that I decided to ask just in case.

The location is quite popular for students, with many tables filled by students with their laptops/books! We couldn't find an available table, so had to settle for sofas outside the café (inside the alumni centre). I could barely taste the oat milk in my decaf Americano, and the blend was not very strong itself. The hot chocolate was fine. The Mushroom Ricotta Rice Bowl ($13.95) had a nice marinade on the mushrooms, and a decent amount of ricotta (on a bed of rice and arugula). The rice is very plain, and perhaps a little mushy/overcooked.\n\nI was disappointed with their Midnight in Havana Rice Bowl ($15), having asked for no arugula, and it coming with the bowl anyways. The place was packed so I didn't feel like asking them to remove it. The pork shoulder was not tender (it was more like dry pulled pork). They were able to use a balsamic dressing instead of their garlic aioli at my request, which was nice of them to accommodate. There are some inconsistencies with their in-store menu and what's online on their Square site, as the Square site says the bowl comes with caramelized onions, but in-store it's pickled onions. On top of the pickled jalapenos, I thought it was too much acidity toppings wise and would have benefited from the caramelized type. Self-service after you receive your order. Would be interested in trying their baked goods (which are unlabelled in their display case), but would skip the bowls."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMiE8GLojK31GVv4M8k9y-jJfyWRKUikLidQ0ZW\u0026fid=0x0:0x6d561b0ad6a3f6f7""],""When"":""2024-10-28""},{""Name"":""Roman Kozak"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUXaei_E5eRgQInxhzdn1QSNV_at7npoBUF_sdv7jvDoiE-7SM2Uw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""High quality food and pastries.

The great: most cookies, bagels and bagel sandwiches, date square, butter mochi, muffins and loaves. The okay: pre-made sandwiches and wraps, sugar cookies and vegan cookie, dessert bars besides the date square, and tiramisu. The coffee is more variable but generally pretty good, and I think the matcha latte is actually one of the best on campus (or at least the smoothest). Do not order an iced London fog/turmeric fog though - they tell you they can make it, but you will get a cold tea bag in watery milk, not a properly steeped iced tea latte.\nThe students who work there are usually pretty friendly and the speed of service is reasonable even though the line gets long at lunchtime when school is in session. Like other AMS-owned outlets, you can not only bring your own drink cup but also bring your own food containers and save $.25 per item.\nThey recently moved across the Nest to a bigger space with more seating. With the move, they now offer for-here mugs for hot drinks, but you have to be kind of aggressive if you want one - you have to say you want your drink for here, in a mug, and probably repeat yourself, otherwise they will probably ignore you, I guess because they’re not expecting it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNqKjJmYV6mZmMyuj4wO5b6DaK9WwoWHXvk-COc\u0026fid=0x0:0x5acb5f931df758b7""],""When"":""2023-7-24""},{""Name"":""Bekah French"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJiYLh-7emQ9AthzE2N_CGxwmtRUdZguPeMRuVIWmhyOtllxQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Visited new location on Saturday (on opposite side of building to where they were before).

Every time I stop here for something I'm disappointed by some aspect of the experience.

Or the $11 avocado toast has like 3 tbsp of avocado on it and a teaspoon of feta. Their aggressive control of ingredient portions makes the prices totally unreasonable.\n- The $5 treats like brownies, lemon bars etc are made en masse and frozen, and kept too many days in a row: they taste like fridge and have poor texture. Absolutely not worth it. (the spinach and feta croissant is a bit more reliable)\n**Service**\n- Every single time I find myself wondering how the service is so slow. They don't train the team to be attentive to orders or to move with pace. On my last order, the kitchen person was picking mint leaves off of stems very slowly and chatting to the barista. They ignored or did not notice when the food order came out of the printer right by their face, and took a full 5 mins to start making the order. Once they did, they became distracted: I could hear the oven beeping after toasting the bun for a full min after it was finished before someone else picked up the task.

The staff is really chill and friendly so the vibe is great, and the food/drink is good all around. In particular they have some of my favourite scones around. Their veggie sandwich is very very good (as long as you're prepared for your hands to smell like focaccia for the rest of the day). Except for during the summer, they have a daily soup which is always very tasty. The regular dessert pastries (brownie, cookies, dessert bars) are all good but not stand-out good, but they sometimes have fancier cakes which are amazing.\nFor their drinks, it is also really hard to go wrong. The masala chai latte is amazing - it's sweet but also richly flavoured with spices. The London fog is also very good. Both of these tea lattes use stone ground tea instead of brewed tea which I think contributes to the intensity. They do a great job with the matcha latte too - it's never clumpy at all. I used to be not the biggest fan of their coffee, but it's grown on me a lot. It's a bit on the acidic side, but if you don't mind that, then the flavour is pretty nice. I really like their mocha too (especially the peppermint mocha available in winter) - this is actually the only place where I really get mochas!\nThey have pizza nights now (7-10 Wed-Fri) where you can get a flatbread pizza big enough to feed two for less than $15.

That was different and created a fun atmosphere.  Let's get down to the chicken review 😋.  I ordered 2 piece with fries for $16.90, since I already had a drink in hand from somewhere else. I got it medium spicy. The chicken came with a slice of white bread underneath!? I was too carbed out to eat the bread. The seasoning and spice on the chicken was very tasty. It wasn't spicy at all, I liked the aroma. The fries were over fried, cause I don't taste the potato in it. Fortunately the seasoning made it easier to eat, so because of that I gave 5 stars for food since there's no 4.5 stars.

Food was decent enough and it has large portions that I couldn’t even finish. Cashier was nice. One suggestion is to maybe have a sign or let customers know they can wait anywhere outside or inside for order. I didn’t know so was standing by tablet with orders and felt I was in the way and was accidentally bumped into. And I tried to ask where I should be for order and then they let me know after I asked. I wish I knew earlier, so I’d wouldn’t have been in the way. Also I think they thought I might be in rush to get order. But I was not in a rush at all. I just didn’t know protocol for where to wait at Downlow since it’s my first time. Cafes usually make you wait at the end of counter to get drinks with your names on it. So I assumed it’s the same. A sign letting customers know would make a difference in the whole experience for everyone. Just a suggestion!

Honestly tasted average, pretty decent if a bit bland. Even the extra hot didn’t taste spicy but rather just peppery, whereas the medium had a more pronounced herby flavour.

I’ve found that the early morning staff is super sweet but the attitude of the afternoon staff is a toss-up. The convenience is the main draw. They have Upmeals entrees and UBC-issue bake goods. The Upmeals stuff is healthy and easy on the palate but interesting. In the past I’ve found that even some of the fresh baked goods somehow came out tasting stale, but this year’s iteration of UBC baking seems better. They’ve also instituted a Pearl Fever “pop-up” where you can get a limited selection bubble tea here (which is good, although I’ve only tried the jelly, which is harder to mess up than pearls) and also ice cream with taiyaki (the waffle is good, the soft serve is just okay - little icy - but it’s an accessible way to experience a fun dessert that’s a little hard to find).\nMy experience with the espresso drinks is - and I only drink decaf, so this may or may not be representative - it’s not awful, but it does taste a little over-roasted. Sometimes adding milk can mellow out bitter coffee but this one basically tastes the same in americano or latte form. The chai is not offensive but is made from a concentrate that’s very sweet and the London fog is also very sweet. Be careful because the hot drinks come out intensely hot.

I've never had any serious problem with the food quality here, but some ingredients seem to not be as fresh or as high-quality as I've come to expect from poke (again, never had anything that was bad, but it's just missing that pristine touch). I also find that some of the flavour combinations are kind of odd, like the pesto-marinated tofu and pineapple or very guac-like avocado scoops.

They also lied about trying to context me about switching the grains in the bowl (quinoa for brown rice) and outright refused to give me a refund or help me in any way. Worse customer service experience of my life.\n\n**Now the long version**\n\nI wanted to order a teriyaki bowl after a long day at work. I saw the picture on DoorDash and it had chicken and I like teriyaki chicken so I ordered. It arrived, turns out the chicken is an add-on so my bowl had to chicken.\n\nI said ok fine I don’t really have lunch plans for tomorrow at work so I’ll order again and select the double chicken protein option and I’ll use the spare second serving of chicken on the first bowl. The second order arrived, and there was no chicken. I checked the receipt this time and I had selected double chicken and was charged for it. They forgot it. I called their store and they claimed in their system it said there was no protein. Not only do I not believe them but they refused to give a refund and offered me zero remedy.\n\nMoreover, to add insult to injury, the second bowl that arrived had quinoa instead of brown rice. This isn’t that big of a deal but what is in which they left a note claiming to have tried to “contact me” about the shortage of brown rice. I received no calls from their store at any point, my only contact was the aforementioned call I made TO them. There was also nothing from my dasher or the DoorDash app saying they tried to call me. So they are just flat out lying and taking my money.\n\nEven if I were to believe them, again the DoorDash receipt clearly showed I added the double protein option for like an additional $9 dollars and I brought this up to them but they claimed the system showed the second order had the same price as the original order. So if they are telling the truth (I don’t believe they are!) THEN STILL THEIR SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND WILL SCREW UP YOUR ORDER AND THEY WONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. Either they are liars or they have a broken mobile ordering system.

noticed that 2 new comments with five stars were written right after I put a review out. One says that it’s written from a UBC student but we were the only ones in the restaurant. Really??\n—-\nI came here with my friend for the first time because of the high reviews, but I was very underwhelmed by the quality of food.\n\nWe ordered 1 Carbonara pasta with 4 beef balls and a Creamy Pesto Sauce as well. The lady taking our order was extremely rude, holding her arms together most of the time (not even a proper eye contact too).\n\nThe portion of the pasta we got was smaller than expected, and the pasta sauce was very bland. I was also expecting actual beef meat balls for the protein, but it felt like eating processed, microwaved meatballs.\n\nI can’t believe all of this including the mango lassi costs $56. We even tipped which made it $64 but we both felt that the food was not worth the price.\n\nThe only good thing was the mango lassi. It tasted good, but not worth the price considering it’s around $6 for a regular cup.\n\nOverall, I’m extremely disappointed about my experience here. I noticed your team sends auto-generated responses for customer feedbacks, but honestly it really doesn’t reflect well on your new customers."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipObiPeftIl5M13d-Zi5CL5dxWo1asSNBVO640QA\u0026fid=0x0:0x903faab4aef83611""],""When"":""2024-10-21""},{""Name"":""Priya Seenivasan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJMhKuaV0UByu_19lq9S8Z0RymGWLGeMkZW32FqcwJdXwdJC4O6=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The food was very tasty and the portion sizes were very generous for the price.

Very warm atmosphere, from the design of the inside to the friendly service. Because the place is relatively small, it’s probably not a good idea to bring a large group, but it’s a nice place for a smaller hang or even to chill by yourself. I have been curious for a while and just tried it with some friends. I probably will be back.\nThey have a great drink menu with lots of specialty cocktails and nonalcoholic drinks. I got a nonalcoholic pineapple guava soda. I don’t like drinks that are too sweet and this was good for me, but some people might find it weak compared to commercial fruit sodas.\nI got a soup and sandwich combo as my entree with the Eggplant Caprese sandwich and the Crab Bisque. I really liked this take on a caprese sandwich, and the baguette was very fresh and soft. The bisque was very good too. Rather than being a super creamy bisque, this was more tomato-based and a little tangy. Good flavour with a fair amount of crab meat. I also liked the little side of coleslaw that was included in the combo.\nWasn’t really planning on getting dessert but then I saw they had a Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding, and I will rarely pass up on bread pudding. It was delicious but, as you might expect from bread pudding made of banana bread, with ice cream, with caramel sauce, VERY rich and heavy, and I had to get some help to finish it. I think this would be ideal for splitting between two people.\nFor this meal, with tip, I paid $48, which surprised me. I thought it was a good meal, but not $50 good - I’d associate that kind of price with a more upscale experience than this. I can understand the soup and sandwich pricing, the dessert was a little expensive, but what really strikes me as obviously overpriced would be the $8 soda. I understand it’s made in house, but it was just a fruity soda - no fruit bits or anything fancy, and no alcohol. It was a nice refreshing drink, but for $8 I wouldn’t say it was worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMA-33yhxlhuJWzrEmE3NBivENZ-qwhvFcoFjxN\u0026fid=0x0:0x57c0ba4874667b57""],""When"":""2023-5-20""},{""Name"":""Keith Ver"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXVdqxLCf1LEt0AU82myo-eUqDcb2LcbdnfhupJTEW0sPAQ-qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Good food and good service!

I didn't realize how much the lettuce and tomato balanced the meat and rice combo. Now it is too dry yet also sort of greasy (not sauce) to eat. No freshness. Not for me anymore. I always get take out, as inside feels grubby, the floor is sticky when you walk. That kind of things always makes me wonder what the cleanliness behind the scenes where your food is made is like... Without the salad it is a spoon of meat and two spoons of rice with a sprinkle of slaw so very overpriced at $13. It is the size of the palm of your hand for reference.

Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with the food.\n\nI ordered the Aburi Set, which is only available from 11am-4pm. It comes with 3 aburi sushi (salmon, tuna + shrimp), salmon teriyaki on rice, shrimp tempura ×2, spring roll ×2, vegetable tempura ×3 (I think), salad, and miso soup. A breakdown of taste is as follows:\n\nAburi sushi: my expectations were highest for this, which is perhaps why I felt so let down. The salmon aburi was okay, but both the tuna and shrimp aburi were overcooked and dry. None of the aburi tasted like they were \""melting in your mouth\"", which was unfortunate. Perhaps a kitchen error where they were flamed for too long.\n\nSalmon teriyaki on rice: the rice was. Rice. The salmon was mid, super average tasting salmon. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThe tempura (both shrimp and veggies): I've had better, but I've also had worse- again, average.\n\nSpring rolls: small, average tasting.\n\nThe salad: super simple side salad. could benefit from more dressing.\n\nThe miso soup: average. Had a good amount of tofu, seaweed, and enoki mushrooms.\n\nOverall comments; I was able to purchase for about $8.50 because of my coupon. The people who passed me my food were nice and polite. The presentation of the food was also nice! However, I likely would not return if i didnt have a coupon. The regular price for the aburi set (at the time of writing) is $16.99.

This establishment prides itself on prompt service and observant staff, showcasing an unwavering dedication to guest contentment. In fact, there were staff hovering near the entrance the entire time looking for tables to clear or anyone needing anything.  As a dog lover, the inclusive pet-friendly policy significantly enhanced our dining experience, contributing to the overall laid-back vibe of the place.\n\nThe outdoor seating area presented a slight hiccup, as only half the tables benefit from the shade, either natural or via umbrellas. However, after a short wait, we managed to nab a shaded spot for our meal.\n\nA point worth noting is the slightly elusive location of the restrooms, hidden within the upstairs hostel. This required a minor search, but the overall experience outweighed this minor inconvenience.\n\nThe charm of DICED lies within its simple but well done menu. The irresistible Cuddle burger has managed to capture the hearts of many, including mine. The unbeatable combination of delectable flavor and affordable pricing make it a standout choice!\n\nA crucial aspect not to be forgotten is the cafe's commendable work within the community. Functioning as a social enterprise, DICED invests in shaping the future of young adults in the culinary field. Every delicious meal served is a testament to their commitment towards empowerment and opportunity.\n\nTo top it off, we found free street parking just one block away, saving us the usual parking hassle.

Karma Indian Bistro since the Michelin Guide added Karma to its list in 2023.\n\nOverall, we thought it was okay compared to some of the award-winning South Asian restaurants in the US.\n\nThere were way too many items on the menu.  If the Michelin Guide recommends a restaurant, I would expect the restaurant to have a smaller menu.  By offering fewer dishes, chefs can focus on perfecting each recipe.  It isn't easy to achieve this with an extensive menu.\n\nWe got two appetizers: the chicken 65 and the onion bhaji.  The chicken 65 was tangy and flavorful; however, it was not spicy.  According to my husband, the chicken 65 is supposed to be spicy (his predilection for South Asian food is strong, and he is very knowledgeable when it comes to the cuisine).  The onion bhaji was delicious!  It was nice and crispy.\n\nThe lamb karahi was okay.  It had a slight kick to it, which was nice.  The lamb was cooked well.  The vegetable jalfrezi was also okay.  The flavors were subtle; I was hoping the flavors would be bolder.\n\nMy husband thought the mango lassi was decent.  It looked pretty.\n\nI am giving Karma three stars.  It is on the Michelin Guide’s list, and I'm rating this restaurant based on other restaurants I have been to that are on the Michelin Guide’s list.  The food should be more than “okay.”  The restaurant should have a smaller, curated menu showcasing its culinary expertise."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOwCNe-9Nz1B-5QkCTOOomaxNwClmQCDj9tlPqm\u0026fid=0x0:0x5caf2e6bd3efdca9""],""When"":""2024-7-24""},{""Name"":""Kat Porco"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWkg9-cmgKUxfFRMDXBCMo90jVcp5ygdnK00acmKCZNlny4Eos=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We visited Karma Indian Bistro five months ago while traveling from Montana, and we’ve been dreaming about it ever since!

You can’t go wrong with their selection, just trust your stomach! I recommend the fried rice + beef stew and the spicy chicken but really anything they have is fantastic. It’s a cost effective meal as well, $10 for a portion that can even be two meals for some people. The staff is very sweet, the auntie doesn’t really speak English so if she seems rude it’s not that it’s intentional- she’s just focused on making sure she gets you the meal you’re looking for. And having lived in Asia myself, I can attest to the authenticity of this restaurant, even the ambience makes me feel like I’m back in a Singaporean hawker center grabbing some lunch."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP2CM3eR8O11ttFsCFON4tixI0t3mA37Pt10uvj\u0026fid=0x0:0x69bd337e16eedc9c""],""When"":""2021-1-19""},{""Name"":""Caleb B"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUkCD0433fS17DhCODy94aOtpHFARwLHVGvT5G3oZFfI0pUamXYAg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This place has FED me.
